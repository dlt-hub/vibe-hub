    response includes a _metadata object with a count field and a self field containing
    the URL with the next page_token for retrieving additional results.
  - Pagination uses page_size (query parameter, default 100) and page_token (query
    parameter) for cursor-based pagination. The page_token value from the response
    should be used in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses page_size and page_token query parameters. Responses include a
    _metadata object with count and self fields; use the self URL or extract page_token
    to request the next page.
  - Request pagination using optional query parameter page_token. Response includes
    _metadata.count (number of items in current page) and _metadata.self (URL with
    page_token for current page). Continue pagination by extracting page_token from
    response and using it in the next request; stop when no new page_token is returned.
