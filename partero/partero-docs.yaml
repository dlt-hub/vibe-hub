auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.partnero.com/guide/affiliate:
  - Authentication is done via a cookie named `partnero_partner` that contains a `UNIQUE_PARTNER_KEY`
    value, which serves as the partner identifier. This key must be extracted from
    the cookie and sent in the request body as the `partner.key` field when calling
    the Partnero API endpoints.
- information_source; https://developers.partnero.com/guide/signup-tracking:
  - The Partnero API uses Bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization header
    with the format "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" in all requests to authenticate your API
    calls.
  - The `key` parameter is required and must be populated with `UNIQUE_PARTNER_KEY`,
    which is obtained from the `partnero_partner` or `partnero_referral` cookie set
    by the Partnero Universal/PartneroJS snippet, or can be extracted from the URL.
    This key serves as the primary identifier for authentication in the request.
- information_source; https://developers.partnero.com/reference/general.html:
  - Authentication is done via Bearer token in the Authorization header. Add an Authorization
    header with value Bearer XXX where XXX is your API token obtained from Partnero.
