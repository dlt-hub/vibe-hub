notes:
- xlwings requires an installation of Excel and therefore only works on Windows and
  macOS.
- macOS currently does not support UDFs.
- When specifying file paths on Windows, you should either use raw strings or double
  back-slashes.
- The add-in is password protected with the password xlwings.
- On macOS, all UDF related functionality is not available.
- Place xw.Book.caller() within the function that is being called from Excel and not
  outside as global variable.
- UDFs are currently only available on Windows.
- You only need to re-import your functions if you change the function arguments or
  the function name.
- Code changes in the actual functions are picked up automatically.
- Place xw.Book.caller() within the function that is being called from Excel and not
  outside as global variable. Otherwise it prevents Excel from shutting down properly
  upon exiting and leaves you with a zombie process when you use Use UDF Server =
  True.
- This is an experimental feature
- xlwings asynchronous functions are supported with any version of Excel
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The view and load functions should exclusively be used for interactive work.
- xlwings comes with a command line client.
- To make it easier to distribute, you can zip up your Python code into a zip file.
- If you use UDFs, this will disable the automatic code reload, so this is a feature
  meant for distribution, not development.
- Default setups work out-of-the-box on Windows and macOS.
- If you get an error message, add the correct path to the local root directory of
  your OneDrive.
- Both Excel and Python file need to show the green check mark in the File Explorer/Finder.
- 'See the dedicated page about how to configure OneDrive and Sharepoint: OneDrive
  and SharePoint.'
- xlwings32-<version>.dll and xlwings64-<version>.dll must be in the same directory
  as your python.exe
- Python interpreter must be correctly installed and configured
- Default converter for DataFrames
- 'Default conversions applied when accessing Range.value include: Numbers -> floats,
  Text -> str, Date and/or time -> datetime, TRUE or FALSE -> bool, Empty cell ->
  None.'
- Excel delivers all numbers as floats in the interactive mode.
- Introduced with v0.7.0, converters define how Excel ranges and their values are
  converted both during reading and writing operations.
- Excel delivers all numbers as floats in the interactive mode, which is the reason
  why the int converter rounds numbers first before turning them into integers.
- If no converter is specified, the default converter is applied when reading.
- xlwings offers several built-in converters that perform type conversion to dictionaries,
  NumPy arrays, Pandas Series and DataFrames.
- Default conversions are applied when accessing Range.value
- Excel delivers all numbers as floats in the interactive mode
- Python objects run through multiple stages of a transformation pipeline when they
  are being written to Excel.
- The Converter class provides basic scaffolding to make the task of writing a new
  Converter easier.
- Expects the Excel file next to this source file, adjust accordingly.
- UDF extensions can be used from every workbook without having to set a reference.
- Since v0.33.5 you can provide your own alias/table name.
- Custom add-ins work on Windows and macOS and are white-labeled xlwings add-ins that
  include all your `RunPython` functions and UDFs.
- UDFs work on Windows only.
- xlwings is just a smart wrapper around pywin32 on Windows and appscript on Mac.
- This is an experimental feature and may be removed in the future.
- Currently, this functionality is only available on Windows for UDFs. The RunPython
  functionality is currently not supported.
- Currently, this functionality is only available on Windows for UDFs. The `RunPython`
  functionality is currently not supported.
- Developer keys are valid for one or more developers and expire after 1 year.
- Deploy keys don’t expire but are bound to a specific version of xlwings.
- This feature requires xlwings PRO.
- By default, xlwings Reports overwrites existing values in templates if there is
  not enough free space for your variable.
- Unlike xlwings, xlwings Reports never writes out the index of pandas DataFrames.
- The 'noheader' filter allows designing custom headers outside of Excel Tables.
- To change the appearance of the Matplotlib or Plotly plot, you can use the same
  filters as with images.
- Markdown support is in an early stage and currently only supports first-level headings,
  bold, italic, and unordered lists.
- macOS currently doesn’t support the formatting (bold, italic, color etc.) of Markdown
  text due to a bug with AppleScript/Excel.
- The reader is currently only available via pip install xlwings or via the conda-forge
  conda channel, but not yet on the official Anaconda channel.
- 'Dynamic ranges: myrange.expand() is currently inefficient, so will slow down the
  reading considerably if the dynamic range is big.'
- Named ranges with sheet scope are currently not shown with their proper name.
- Accessing data via table names isn’t supported at the moment.
- This is only a file reader, writing files is currently not supported.
- 'Zero-config: The end user doesn’t have to configure anything throughout the whole
  process.'
- 'No add-in required: No installation of the xlwings add-in required.'
- xlwings now allows to authenticate and authorize users via Azure AD in connection
  with the Ribbon add-in or VBA standalone module.
- xlwings PRO adds an ultra fast file reader, allowing you to read Excel files much
  faster than via pandas.read_excel()
- The Excel File Reader now supports the Names collection.
- 'xlwings Server: added support for named ranges via mysheet[''myname''] or mysheet.range(''myname'')'
- 'PRO Feature: This release adds support for Markdown-based formatting of text, both
  in cells as well as in shapes.'
- 'Bug Fix macOS: There are no more timeouts when opening or saving large workbooks
  that take longer than 60 seconds.'
- Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped
- Cross-platform support for Microsoft Excel for Mac.
- Slightly enhanced Chart support to control the ChartType
- pytz is no longer a dependency as datetime object are now being read in from Excel
  as time-zone naive
- xlwings allows you to run multiple instances of Excel, but it's not officially supported
  by Excel for Mac.
- On Mac, while xlwings allows you to run multiple instances of Excel, it’s a feature
  that is not officially supported by Excel for Mac.
- This API allows interaction with Excel workbooks.
- xlwings connects to Excel files and requires Excel to be installed for interactive
  mode.
- Easiest way to connect to a book is via xw.Book
- xw.books can be used to access all open books
- 'The easiest way to connect to a book is offered by xw.Book: it looks for the book
  in all app instances and returns an error, should the same book be open in multiple
  instances.'
- On macOS, characters are currently not supported due to bugs/lack of support in
  AppleScript.
- Returns the native object (`pywin32` or `appscript` obj) of the engine being used.
- Gets or sets the text of a note. Keep in mind that the note must already exist!
- The picture object is a member of the pictures collection.
- Represents the columns of a range.
- On macOS, formatting is currently not supported, but things like bullet points will
  still work.
- Copy to second Book requires to use before or after
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
