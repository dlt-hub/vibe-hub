  : - SAML authentication is used where the identity provider authenticates the user
      and returns a SAML assertion. The user agent then exchanges this assertion for
      an access token by making a request to the token operation with grant_type set
      to password, client_id, username as email address, password as the parsed SAML
      ticket, and auth_mode set to SAML in the request body. Optionally, a finalUri
      query parameter can be passed to the SAML login endpoint to specify where to
      redirect after authentication.

  : - CSM REST API supports OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization.
      The system acts as both the resource server and authorization server. OAuth2
      enables clients to obtain access tokens from the authorization server on behalf
      of users, which are then sent to the resource server to access protected resources.
      Optionally, SAML authentication protocol can be configured for the REST API,
      in which case CSM no longer serves as the authorization server.
    - 'The Cherwell REST API supports two authentication protocols: OAuth2 (where
      CSM acts as the authorization server) and SAML (where an external SAML identity
      provider acts as the authorization server). Client IDs are required and must
      be created in CSM Administrator. Token requests are authenticated through the
      configured protocol, and the identity provider returns tokens to authorize API
      access.'

  - API key authentication is required. The API key must be created according to the
    documentation referenced in the "Using the REST API Key" guide, but the specific
    header name, parameter name, or placement method is not detailed in this excerpt.
  - Ivanti Neurons uses API key authentication for REST API endpoints. To authenticate,
    you need to enter an activated API key in the Action Credentials configuration.
    For on-premises ITSM instances, append /HEAT to the server name. Refer to the
    Ivanti documentation on "Using the REST API Key" for details on creating and activating
    the API key.
