notes:
- A paired user can create a new pair of keys via BLE without the Smart Lock being
  in pairing mode. It requires only the knowledge of the Admin PIN.
- Another practical solution could be to always use the same keys (for all your guests),
  which you have stored inside your app.
- Ensure proper OAuth2 setup in Nuki developer console.
- Requires setup of connected app in Nuki API
- These GTC enter into force on July 2nd 2025 and shall replace all previous versions
  of the GTC.
