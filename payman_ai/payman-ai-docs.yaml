notes:
- Node.js 20+ is required for full compatibility.
- Python >=3.9 is required for full compatibility.
- Paymanâ€™s OAuth system allows your application to securely request and manage access
  to wallets, payees, and transactions.
- In your code, you typically want to extract the main answer from the first artifact.
- Payman is invite-only to ensure secure onboarding.
- TSD wallets are hidden by default. To access them, toggle on Developer Mode in your
  Payman Dashboard settings.
- Payees must be added before any payment can be made using the SDK or dashboard.
- No policy = no access. Policies are mandatory for any programmatic money movement.
- No app or agent can access a wallet without an assigned policy.
