auth_info:
- information_source; https://clickhouse.com/blog/automatic-query-endpoints:
  - Existing Cloud API keys are used as the endpoint authentication method. Future
    versions will support JWT-based authentication for improved user interface integration.
- information_source; https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-single-page-applications-with-clickhouse-and-http:
  - Token-based access control is supported, including anonymous authentication tokens.
    ClickHouse provides Role Based Access Control to manage permissions at the table
    and row level, with credentials passed via the HTTP interface (default ports 8123
    or 8443 for SSL). Query parameters should be used to prevent SQL injection when
    templating queries.
- information_source; https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/get-started/query-endpoints:
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with OpenAPI credentials. Send credentials
    as base64-encoded openApiKeyId:openApiKeySecret in the Authorization header (format:
    "Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>") or via the --user curl parameter. The header
    x-clickhouse-endpoint-version is also required but is not auth-related.'
  - Basic Auth is required using OpenAPI Key and Secret credentials. Send the key
    and secret as HTTP Basic Authentication in the Authorization header (base64-encoded
    as "key:secret"). Appropriate permissions for the query endpoint are necessary.
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Credentials must be provided as openApiKeyId
    and openApiKeySecret, either via curl's --user flag (which generates a Basic Authorization
    header with base64-encoded credentials) or as an Authorization header set to Basic
    followed by base64-encoded openApiKeyId:openApiKeySecret. Optional headers x-clickhouse-endpoint-upgrade
    and x-clickhouse-endpoint-version can be included to access version 2 features.
