notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- All requests are rate limited to 20 requests per minute
- All license keys are exclusively generated and managed by AppSumo through webhooks
  triggered by events such as Purchase, Activate, Upgrade, Downgrade, Deactivate,
  and Migrate.
- Redirect URLs are essential for the OAuth flow, guiding users back to your app with
  an authorization code after access is granted.
- If you receive a 401 Unauthorized error when using an access_token, it likely means
  the token has expired.
- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of connected app in AppSumo Partner Portal
- The 'code' is single-use only and will expire after it’s used or the OAuth attempt
  fails.
- License key is the primary identifier for both you and AppSumo.
- 'Important note regarding add-ons: identifies an add-on webhook by the presence
  of the parent_license_key.'
- It is the responsibility of the AppSumo Partner to activate the user in their application
  as well.
- Ensure to send a successful (200) response to confirm receipt of the webhook.
- Webhook requests must return a successful (200) response.
- AppSumo includes security measures in every webhook sent to partners.
- Each webhook contains security headers that help validate the integrity of the message.
- Webhook responses are limited to 10 items.
- All webhook events must be triggered exclusively by AppSumo.
- AppSumo does not provide the user's email address directly through Webhooks
- When updating your URLs in the AppSumo Partner Portal, it's essential to also update
  them on your back end to ensure they match exactly
- It's crucial that once your product is live on AppSumo, you do not change these
  URLs, as this will break the connection between AppSumo and your system.
