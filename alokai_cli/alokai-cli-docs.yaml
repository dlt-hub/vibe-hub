notes:
- Each product can be used independently.
- Updated the enterprise registry to npm.alokai.cloud.
- Every sdk request should contain x-alokai-locale header instead of vsf-locale cookie.
- Use Node.js version 22.14.0 or higher for optimal performance, security, and compatibility.
- You should now ensure that environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_ALOKAI_MIDDLEWARE_SSR_API_URL
  (for Next.js apps) and NUXT_PUBLIC_ALOKAI_MIDDLEWARE_SSR_API_URL (for Nuxt apps)
  are set in your file both locally and in your deployed application.
- Alokai Enterprise is a commercial offering from the Alokai team that gives you all
  the tools you need to launch your shop.
- Additional stores need to be bootstrapped by the Alokai team.
- All store management operations must be performed through the Alokai CLI.
- Native Next.js/Nuxt commands will not work correctly with the multistore setup,
  as they don't handle the inheritance and configuration requirements of Alokai stores.
- Mocks simulate API responses during testing, making tests reliable and fast.
- UI mode is great for debugging as it shows test execution step by step and lets
  you inspect the page state.
- The CLI uses the file-based inheritance rules to compose the stores by collecting
  files from base applications, applying overrides from parent stores, and adding
  store-specific customizations.
- Each deployable store must have a valid configuration in alokai.config.json.
- Template stores shouldn't be placed in the alokai.config.json file as they are not
  deployed.
