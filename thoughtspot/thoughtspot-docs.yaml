- Sharding partitions very large tables into smaller, faster, more easily managed
  parts called data shards
- By default, ThoughtSpot replicates tables. To shard tables, you must add the PARTITION
  BY HASH ( ) clause to your CREATE TABLE statement
- The number of shards for a given table should not take up more than 60% of your
  total available CPU
- Each shard should host about 15-20 million rows of data
- The ideal number of shards is the number of rows in a table divided by 20 million
- A given table should not have more than 1000 shards as a best practice

- If you have a large dimension table, more than 40 million rows, you might choose
  to shard it along with the fact table it is joined with
- If the table has a primary key, the shard key must be a subset of the primary key
- Choose a shard key that distributes data well across keys
- Choose a shard key that results in a wide variety of keys
- If you plan to join two or more tables that are both sharded, both tables must use
  the same shard key
