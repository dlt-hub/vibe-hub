auth_info:
- information_source; https://miniflux.app/docs/fever.html:
  - To activate the Fever API, you must choose a username and password in the integration
    section. The API uses these credentials for authentication, though the specific
    header names, parameter names, or request format are not detailed in this documentation
    excerpt.
- information_source; https://miniflux.app/docs/webhooks.html:
  - Miniflux signs webhook requests using HMAC-SHA256. The signature is sent in the
    X-Miniflux-Signature HTTP header, computed from the request body and an auto-generated
    secret key retrieved from Settings > Integrations > Webhook. Validate incoming
    webhooks by computing hash_hmac('sha256', request_body, secret_key) and comparing
    it to the X-Miniflux-Signature header value using constant-time comparison.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://miniflux.app/docs/api.html:
  - Pagination for the Get Entries endpoint uses offset and limit query parameters.
    The offset parameter specifies the starting position, and limit controls how many
    entries are returned per request; increment offset by the limit value to fetch
    subsequent pages until the desired number of entries is retrieved.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of entries per request (default not stated), offset specifies the starting position.
    Stop paginating when fewer results than limit are returned or when offset exceeds
    total results.
