auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.iqm.com/Getting%20Started/REST-API-Reference/:
  - The IQM API uses bearer token authentication along with an Organization Workspace
    ID (owId). Authentication tokens are obtained during sign up and login, and the
    bearer token should be sent in the Authorization header for API requests.
- information_source; https://developers.iqm.com/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide/:
  - Bearer authentication tokens are required for API requests. On sign up, a bearer
    token and refresh token are returned; the access token is valid for 24 hours and
    must be refreshed using the refresh token afterward. On log in, an Organization
    Workspace ID (owId) is returned and required for all API calls. Before sign up
    or log in, request a Client ID and Client Secret from support@iqm.com; these credentials
    are used as header authorization for the authentication endpoints. The bearer
    token should be sent in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests,
    and the owId must be included with all API calls.
  - The API uses a login endpoint at POST https://api.iqm.com/api/v3/ua/login that
    accepts grantType, email, and password in the JSON request body to obtain tokens.
    A separate refresh token endpoint exists to get new access tokens using a URL
    encoded form with the refresh token. The documentation indicates token-based authentication
    is used, with access tokens and refresh tokens being part of the auth flow.
  - The IQM platform uses OAuth2 with password grant type for authentication. Send
    a POST request to https://api.iqm.com/api/v3/ua/oauth/token with Authorization
    header containing Basic auth (Client ID and Client Secret base64-encoded), Content-Type
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and form-encoded parameters grant_type=password,
    username=user email, and password=user password. The response includes access_token,
    refresh_token, token_type=bearer, and scope read write. Use the access_token in
    subsequent requests as a bearer token.
  - The Log In endpoint requires Client ID and Client Secret to be sent in the header
    for authentication. The endpoint accepts email and password in a URL encoded form
    body and returns an access token, refresh token, and Organization Workspace ID
    that are used for subsequent authenticated requests to the IQM platform.
