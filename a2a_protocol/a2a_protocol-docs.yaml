auth_info:
- information_source; https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/:
  - A2A uses HTTP transport layer authentication rather than JSON-RPC payload authentication.
    Identity information is handled at the HTTP level following standard enterprise
    web security practices. The specific authentication scheme, headers, parameters,
    and credentials required are not detailed in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'Clients obtain credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, JWTs) through an out-of-band
    process specific to the authentication scheme and identity provider, then include
    them in HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>, X-API-Key: <value>)
    for every A2A request. The server must authenticate each request based on provided
    HTTP credentials, use standard HTTP status codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)
    for authentication challenges, and may include WWW-Authenticate headers to indicate
    required authentication schemes.'
  - Identity information is handled at the HTTP transport layer, not within A2A JSON-RPC
    payloads. Production deployments must use HTTPS with TLS 1.3+ and strong cipher
    suites. Clients discover required authentication schemes from the AgentCard's
    authentication field, which may include Bearer tokens for OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth,
    or API keys. Credentials are obtained out-of-band through processes specific to
    the identity provider and are not part of the A2A protocol specification itself.
    Clients should verify the server's TLS certificate against trusted certificate
    authorities during the TLS handshake.
  - 'The agent interface supports security schemes defined via OpenAPI 3.0 Security
    Scheme Objects in the securitySchemes field, with a security array specifying
    which schemes apply to all interactions. The security array uses an OR-of-ANDs
    logic: each object in the array represents one valid combination of schemes (e.g.,
    OAuth with "read" scope, or API-key plus mTLS), and a request must satisfy at
    least one complete object in the array to be authorized.'
- information_source; https://a2a-protocol.org/v0.1.0/specification/:
  - A2A requires clients to discover authentication schemes from the server's AgentCard
    object's authentication field, which uses OpenAPI-aligned scheme names like "Bearer"
    for OAuth 2.0 tokens, "Basic" for Basic Auth, and "ApiKey" for API keys. Credentials
    are obtained out-of-band and transmitted at the HTTP transport layer, not in JSON-RPC
    payloads. Production deployments must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher, and clients
    should verify the server's TLS certificate against trusted certificate authorities.
