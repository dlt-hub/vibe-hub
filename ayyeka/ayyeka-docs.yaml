auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.ayyeka.com/en/knowledge/csv-generator-agent-installation-and-user-guide:
  - The API uses OAuth2-style token-based authentication. Credentials are configured
    via a JSON configuration file with APIEndpoint, AuthEndpoint, and APIClientKey
    fields; the AuthEndpoint is used to obtain tokens, and APIClientKey holds the
    client credential needed for authentication requests.
  - The API uses OAuth2-style token-based authentication. Credentials are obtained
    by sending the APIClientKey and APIClientSecret to the AuthEndpoint at https://restapi.ayyeka.com/auth/token.
    The resulting access token should then be used in subsequent API requests, typically
    in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
- information_source; https://www.ayyeka.com/en/knowledge/getting-started-with-rest-api:
  - Ayyeka uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. After generating an API Client Key and
    Secret, submit them to the authentication server with grant_type set to client_credentials,
    client_id set to your application's API Client Key, and client_secret set to your
    application's API Client Secret to obtain a temporary access token. Include the
    access token in the Authorization header of all REST API calls. Access tokens
    are valid for 60 minutes; generate a new token when the current one expires.
  - OAuth 2.0 with Client Credentials grant type is required. Generate an access token
    using your API Client Key and Client Secret at the Authentication Server URL,
    then include the token in the Authorization header as Bearer [Access Token].
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the header `Authorization:
    Bearer [access_token]` in requests. The access token is obtained from a previous
    authorization response. Authorization requests are rate-limited to 15 requests
    per 15 minutes per key; reuse tokens until expiration to avoid hitting the limit.
    A 403 Forbidden response indicates the token has expired or access was revoked.'
