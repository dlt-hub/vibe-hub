auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.absuite.net/Online-Services/REST-API.html:
  - All REST requests require HTTPS protocol. The Authorization header must contain
    an OAuth2 bearer token acquired from APS. The Content-Type header is typically
    set to application/json. The Host header specifies the server domain or IP address.
    Request body format depends on the specific API operation and is specified in
    the service's REST API documentation.
  - Alliance Online Services (AOS) REST APIs use OAuth2-style authentication coordinated
    through Alliance Passport Services (APS). Client applications must register with
    APS to obtain credentials (client id/secret), then exchange those for an access
    token. The access token is sent in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent
    REST API requests, where the token's claims are validated by the service for both
    authentication and authorization.
  - Authorization code grant and client credentials grant (OAuth 2.0) are supported.
    For authorization code grant, exchange the authorization code obtained in step
    1 (via code query parameter) for an access token by sending an HTTPS POST request
    to the /token endpoint with code and client_secret (required for web applications)
    in the request body. For client credentials grant, non-interactive clients send
    client credentials directly to the /token endpoint to obtain an access token without
    user delegation.
  - OAuth2 Authorization Framework is used for client authentication. Web/confidential
    clients must securely maintain and present credentials (client ID and secret)
    during APS authentication to acquire an access token. Native/public clients use
    delegated authorization with signed-in user identity. Client applications must
    be registered with APS in an Online Business Tenant before runtime, with permission
    requests configured for accessing REST APIs and IAM Role-Based Access Control
    settings established for authorization.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code grant flow is used for interactive clients. First,
    request an authorization code from the /authorize endpoint using query parameters:
    client_id (application GUID), redirect_uri (URL-encoded registered redirect URI
    that must match exactly), and resource (URL-encoded REST API identifier URI).
    The authorization code is returned in the code query parameter of a 302 redirect
    to your redirect_uri. Then exchange the authorization code for an access token
    at the /token endpoint (details for this exchange are referenced but not fully
    shown in this excerpt).'
