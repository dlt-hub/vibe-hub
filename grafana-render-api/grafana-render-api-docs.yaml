notes:
- Jira datasource plugin for Grafana
- The token used must have appropriate permissions for the requested actions.
- You can use the search endpoint to get a list of all your dashboards.
- To get a list of panels in a given dashboard, parse the actual dashboard definition.
- I was given a p12 key file with a password, and realized that there was no way in
  grafana to use it as I normally do with postman.
- My curls work, but no matter how I try entering the credentials, grafana seems to
  append my ‘Get’ in a way that does not work.
- As of writing, UQL doesn’t support pagination
- You can definitely do this by using popular scripts e.g. Python or Bash (or simply
  with cURL command).
- The application server returns the information in pages.
- API limits to batches of 100 records.
- Trying to create dashboards by feeding Rest API data (Json format) into them.
- Ensure to use the correct token created during InfluxDB setup.
- Check that the bucket names match and that you are using the correct organization
  name or ID.
- You can authenticate to Grafana using your own oauth service.
- the page size automatically adjusts to the height of the table
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Ensure the token has the correct permissions.'
- The curl that shows as failing in the query inspector seems to show that the ‘GET’
  always precedes the auth info.
- Failed to render to png
- 'parse error on line 1, column 1: bare " in non-quoted-field'
