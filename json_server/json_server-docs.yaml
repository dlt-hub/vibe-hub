  - 'JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication, with digitally signed tokens
    transmitted in both request and response headers. The server encodes access rights
    within the JWT, eliminating the need for database lookups. Authentication context
    varies: applications may be authenticated as clients with specific permissions,
    or the API may need to identify individual users and their rights depending on
    whether private user data is being accessed.'

  - 'Authentication for POST, UPDATE, and DELETE operations can be done via three
    methods: cookies with nonces, OAuth 1.0a, or Basic Authentication. Cookies use
    WordPress nonces for validation. OAuth 1.0a is the recommended production method.
    Basic Authentication requires sending username and password with each request
    via standard HTTP headers and is primarily for development.'
  - Basic Authentication is supported via the Basic Auth plugin (installed from GitHub).
    Credentials are sent as base64-encoded username:password in the Authorization
    header. Use the `--user username:password` flag in cURL or configure username/password
    in tools like Postman; the API endpoint `/wp-json/users/me` requires authentication
    and returns an error if credentials are missing. OAuth is recommended for production
    use instead of Basic Auth.
  - OAuth 1.0a is recommended for production use. Basic Auth is also supported but
    OAuth 1.0a is the preferred authentication method, as it is tested and backed
    by major companies.
  - 'The WordPress JSON REST API plugin supports three authentication methods: cookies,
    OAuth 1.0a, and Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication is intended for development
    only, while OAuth 1.0a is recommended for production use due to security advantages.
    Credentials are transmitted via standard HTTP mechanisms (headers for Bearer tokens,
    request bodies for OAuth parameters, or cookies for session-based auth).'
