  - 'SSH-JWT authentication is the primary method: sign a JWT with your private key
    and include it in the Authorization header as "Authorization: SSH-JWT <your_signed_jwt>".
    The server verifies the JWT using your registered public key. Legacy Basic Auth
    is also supported by sending credentials as "Authorization: Basic <base64(email:api_key)>"
    or via --user flag, but is deprecated. Both methods can enforce IP CIDR allowlists
    for additional security.'
