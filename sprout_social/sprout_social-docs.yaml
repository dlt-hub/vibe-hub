  - 'Authorization header requires Bearer token, which can be either an OAuth access
    token or an API token. Include Authorization: Bearer <token> in all requests.'
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. The token is passed in the Authorization
    header with format "Bearer $TOKEN" in requests to the Sprout Social API endpoints.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer $TOKEN" when making requests to the media upload endpoint.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer $TOKEN".
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with each request, where `<token>`
    is your authentication token.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.sproutsocial.com/docs/:
  - Pagination for Analytics Endpoints uses offset-based paging with `current_page`
    (1-indexed) and `total_pages` in the response `paging` object. Request pages via
    a `page` parameter (implied from context); stop when `current_page` equals `total_pages`.
    Maximum response size is capped at 10,000 results; for larger datasets, use cursor-based
    pagination with a `limit` parameter in the request body.
  - Pagination for the Listening Messages endpoint uses limit (max 100, default 50)
    as a query parameter to control messages returned per response, with sort parameter
    controlling order by created_time (default descending). The response includes
    a paging object with current_page field indicating the current page number.
  - Pagination is based on 1000 results per response. The response includes a paging
    object with current_page and total_pages fields to indicate pagination state and
    navigate through pages.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme with `page_cursor` (optional, passed in
    request body) to fetch the next page. Response includes `current_page` and `total_pages`
    fields. Default limit is 50 messages per response, maximum limit is 100. Pagination
    only supports fetching the next page sequentially.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based approach with limit parameter in request body. Set
    limit to desired page size, then use the last guid value from the previous response
    in a guid.gt() filter for the next request. Continue paginating until no data
    is returned.
