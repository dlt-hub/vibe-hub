notes:
- BrowserCat is built on open source technology.
- Free! Your first 1k/month is on us!
- When you cross your *soft limit*, we’ll send you an email asking you to approve
  an increase to your limits.
- Connect using any Playwright- or CDP-compatible client.
- Playwright recommends using bundled versions of chromium, firefox, and webkit.
- By default, Playwright executes test files in parallel, but it executes a file’s
  tests in order.
- Use CLI config flags for one-time adjustments, but set project defaults within your
  `playwright.config.ts` file.
- Retry failed tests before marking as failed
- Repeat all tests before marking as passed
- Fail individual tests if they exceed timeout
- Fail test suite if exceeds timeout
- Fail test suite if `.only` is present
- Fail test suite early, after N failures
- Playwright can’t currently intercept traffic to webworkers.
- API pricing based on requests and session duration.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- No more flying dark. Use our dashboards to manage options, set alerts, cap usage,
  monitor logs, and more.
- We actively avoid leveraging third-party cookies and collect as little data as possible.
- BrowserCat is built on open source technology
- Connect to BrowserCat using the API key instead of launching a browser locally.
- Requires a BrowserCat account and API key for access
- Sign up for a free BrowserCat account
- Create an API key
- BrowserCat’s browser fleet is accessible via a WebSocket connection.
- Headers trump query params
- Configuration is fast and easy.
- Region config is a fast and cost-efficient way of circumventing region-based restrictions.
- Headless mode can be specified using query parameters or the browsercat-opts header.
- Your source URL should not be included in your sitemap, nor should it be accessible
  to users.
- If your source URL requires user authentication, pass along your user’s session
  token with the request.
- Market projected to reach $70.53 billion by 2030
- AI-driven cyber attacks are a daily threat, with 93% of companies expecting to face
  them.
- In 2023, healthcare organizations experienced an average of 1,613 cyber attacks
  per week.
- Data includes projections and statistics from various surveys and reports.
- Use environment variables or secret managers for sensitive data.
- Ensure communication with cloud services is encrypted (HTTPS/WSS).
- Use parallel execution to speed up testing
- Playwright captures screenshots and videos on test failure
- Playwright is open-source and actively maintained.
- Compatible with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Webkit.
- Fingerprint spoofing is essential for protecting user privacy and avoiding detection.
- Fingerprinting is considered a stealthy tracking method.
- Spoofing helps mask your real identity.
- WebRTC can expose local and public IP addresses to web scripts
- Disabling WebRTC can prevent IP leaking
- Using anti-detect browsers can help set a custom WebRTC IP
- WebRTC spoofing is mainly about protecting your IP information and ensuring it matches
  your intended identity.
- Always test on a variety of sites after heavy modifications.
- Overriding too much or incorrectly can break sites.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in BrowserCat
- Proxy rotation helps preserve anonymity and avoid anti-bot measures.
- Useful for gathering large amounts of data without being blocked.
- Implementing residential proxies can get tricky, especially where scalability and
  efficient management are required.
- BrowserCat makes it easy, in just a line or two of code, to route our browser traffic
  through your residential proxy of choice.
- BrowserCat provides a cloud-based solution for running Playwright scripts.
- Puppeteer is primarily for Chrome/Chromium with experimental Firefox support.
- Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Both Puppeteer and Playwright run in headless mode by default.
- Running in headless mode can trip anti-bot systems.
- Choose Puppeteer for simplicity and straightforward needs.
- Choose Playwright for extra flexibility, stealth, or multi-browser support.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or permissions'
- 'Tests failing only in GitHub Actions? Use headless: false and take screenshots
  to debug.'
- Tests flaking due to network issues? Add waitForTimeout() or retries.
- CAPTCHA challenges require third-party solving services.
