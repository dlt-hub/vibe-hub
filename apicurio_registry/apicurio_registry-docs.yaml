  : - Apicurio Registry supports role-based authorization via JWT tokens (with roles
      like sr-admin and org-admin assignable through Keycloak), owner-only authorization
      for artifact modifications, and optional anonymous read-only access. Authentication
      is enforced through JWT validation with role mappings, configurable via environment
      variables REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE, OWNER_ONLY_AUTHZ_ENABLED, and REGISTRY_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_READ_ENABLED.
    - Apicurio Registry uses Keycloak-based OAuth with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication
      and authorization. The default realm name is "registry", the API client ID is
      "registry-api" with protocol "openid-connect" and access type "bearer-only",
      and the web console client is configured separately. Role-based authorization
      provides admin, write, and read-only roles, plus content-based authorization
      where only artifact creators can update or delete their content.
    - 'Apicurio Registry uses role-based authorization with internally managed role
      mappings controlled by environment variables. Users are assigned one of three
      roles (ADMIN, DEVELOPER, READ_ONLY) via the /admin/roleMappings endpoint, with
      admin-override configuration available through REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_* environment
      variables to identify administrators. The ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOU environment variable
      (default: token) determines the authorization source.'

  : - Apicurio Registry API v3 uses bearer token authentication. Include the access
      token in the Authorization header as "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" for both export
      and import operations. The token must be obtained separately and provided as
      an environment variable or directly in the curl command.
    - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the access token in
      the Authorization header as "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" when making requests to the
      Registry API v3 endpoints.
