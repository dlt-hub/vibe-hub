auth_info:
- information_source; http://demoa.heimdalldata.com/docs/manager/apis.html:
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required for all API endpoints. Credentials must
    be provided using the --user flag in curl (or Authorization header with base64-encoded
    username:password in format "Basic base64(username:password)"). The username and
    password are Heimdall's configured credentials, with default values being username
    "admin" and password "heimdall".
  - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials. Send
    credentials via the --user flag (or Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials
    in the format username:password). In the example, admin:heimdall are used as credentials
    for a local Heimdall instance on port 8087.
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Provide Heimdall username and password
    using the --user flag in curl (format: username:password), which sends credentials
    in the Authorization header as base64-encoded "Basic {base64(username:password)}".
    The Content-Type header must be set to application/json for POST requests.'
  - This API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed as username and
    password in the --user parameter (formatted as username:password), which are transmitted
    in the Authorization header with Basic scheme encoding. The username and password
    correspond to Heimdall's user credentials.
