notes:
- Keep your test data separate from your production data to ensure clean, actionable
  insights!
- Create separate keys for debug/production to keep data clean.
- Create separate keys for debug and production to keep data clean.
- Start the SDK once, from the earliest available Context that persists for the entire
  application lifecycle.
- Never call it from multiple places—this triggers 'SDK already started' warnings
  and may break uploads.
- Automatic tagging will capture the activity names by default.
- JavaScript interface must be created for WebView integration.
- Ensure to attach the interface correctly to call native methods.
- Keep in mind that at the moment this is only supported for AndroidX
- UXCam records screens so you can debug and improve UX—but it should never receive
  raw Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- This guide covers occlusion methods specifically for Jetpack Compose.
- The uxcam-ktx artifact is only required if you need to use the Jetpack Compose occlusion
  APIs.
- Use 'uxcam-occlude' class to handle occlusion of sensitive views.
- Ensure the call runs after the SDK has been initialized with UXCam.startWithConfiguration()
- Only non-null & non-empty User IDs are accepted
- Event names are case-sensitive.
- Use constants to prevent typos.
- By default, integration logging is disabled.
- No logs appearing? Confirm logging is enabled (API or launch argument). Check console
  filters in your IDE.
- Verification failed? Verify your appKey and SDK version match the dashboard. Ensure
  network connectivity and firewall allow SDK requests.
- Uploads stuck or failing? Inspect Session await upload remained warnings. Check
  individual file-type errors for more details.
- Running two crash reporters (e.g., Crashlytics and UXCam) can lead to conflicts.
  Disable one of them at app start.
- Handled exception reporting is available only for iOS, Android and Flutter apps
- Flutter SDK version must be 2.5.0 or above to support handled exceptions
- UXCam automatically stops a session when the app goes to the background.
- Pausing Session Recording stops capturing session data temporarily.
- Pausing Video Recording stops video but captures session data.
- The SDK by default opts-in users for UXCam recording on app installs.
- The optIn/optOut setting resets to opt-In if the user un-installs and re-installs
  the app or clears app data.

- All UXCam properties and methods are also available in UXCamSwiftUI without additional
  import of UXCam and can be accessed using UXCamCore.
- Screen Tagging and Hiding Sensitive Data for Swift UI have some differences.
- Automatic Screen Tagging — the recommended approach
- If everything looks good – simply rename screens in Dashboard → Screens
- Automatic screen tagging captures UIViewControllers by default.
- Manual tagging can coexist with automatic tagging.
- Uses automatic screen tagging based on navigationTitle or tabItem method in SwiftUI.
- Keep one shared instance for the UXCamWebBridge to allow multiple web views to reuse
  the same handler.
- Call UXCamBridge.tag() on route changes and after in-page transitions to avoid 0
  s duplicates.
- Good privacy practices are non‑negotiable—especially under GDPR, CCPA and Apple’s
  App Store policies.
- Use the uxcam-occlude class to handle occlusion of sensitive views in webviews.
- By default UXCam assigns a random alias per install. Override it only when you have
  a stable internal ID.
- Skip email / phone unless you have a signed DPA.
- When to call – as early as you know who the user is (post‑login, token refresh,
  deep‑link resume).
- Re‑calling with the same ID is a no‑op; with a different ID it starts a new session.
- Case‑sensitive keys – Plan and plan create two columns. Stick to one convention.
- Use stable IDs (`auth0_id`, `crm_id`).
- Prefer enums (`plan = free/premium`).
- Compress ranges (`age_band = 25‑34`).
- Store booleans (`has_card = true`).
- Rotate IDs if a leak is suspected.
- 'Automatic events already captured: Rage Taps and UI Freezes.'
- No explicit flush call is required—the SDK uploads when the app resigns active or
  every 15 seconds on Wi‑Fi.
- Crash Symbolication is only available for iOS SDK 3.6.19 onwards.
- With this you are going to be able to get the verification status when UXCam starts
  recording a session.
- Pausing Video Recording stops recording videos but session data is still captured.
- configuration.enableIntegrationLogging=true (By default, it will be disabled)
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data collection
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance when handling user data.
- Session recording starts immediately after configuration.
- 'Important for Expo: UXCam requires native code, so you''ll need EAS Build.'
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use different keys for development/staging/production
- Store production keys in CI/CD environment variables
- Validate key format before initialization
- Ensure EAS Build is configured
- Clear cache and reinstall
- Expo does not support native modules so previously, in order to add libraries such
  as UXCam you will need to detach your project.
- Now with the introduction of EAS, detaching your Expo project is no longer necessary.
- Manual tagging is strongly recommended for React Native due to navigation architecture.
- Efficient privacy rules using screen names for targeted occlusion
- Ensures meaningful screen-level insights for user journey
- Privacy protection ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance by preventing sensitive user data
  from appearing in session recordings.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The HTML class approach (`uxcam-occlude`) is the simplest and most reliable method.
- View-level occlusion allows you to hide specific components or views that contain
  sensitive information.
- View-level occlusion in React Native provides granular control over which components
  are hidden during recording.
- Use refs to apply occlusion to specific components.
- Handle dynamic content appropriately.
- Always include error handling for robust implementations.
- Consider performance when occluding many components.
- Avoid the use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless a Data Processing
  Agreement (DPA) is signed.
- Each event can include up to 20 properties.
- Event names and property keys are case sensitive.
- Supports performance monitoring and ANR detection.
- 'Use startNewSession() sparingly: Only when you need to start a completely new session'
- 'Handle completion callbacks: Always provide completion handlers for async operations'
- 'Error handling: Wrap recording control calls in try-catch blocks'
- 'User feedback: Provide visual feedback when recording state changes'
- 'Session lifecycle: Understand when sessions automatically start and stop'
- Currently, UXCam only captures native crashes (iOS/Android). JavaScript crashes
  are not automatically captured and require manual reporting.
- API key is valid and properly configured
- Ensure privacy screen names match tagged screen names exactly
- For custom components, ensure proper ref forwarding
- API key must be valid and properly configured
- Ensure sessions only upload when app goes to background
- Ensure EAS Build is Configured
- Check eas.json Configuration
- Verify Package Installation
- App feels slower after UXCam integration
- Increased memory usage
- Battery drain on device
- Ensure app backgrounds for at least 5 seconds to trigger session upload
- UXCam requires native code and cannot run in Expo Go.
- Test on physical device for best results
- Ensure UXCam initialization in main activity
- Ensure the app is sent to the background and not fully closed. Data transmission
  may not occur if the app is force-closed before the session is uploaded.
- Verify you are using the latest version of the UXCam Flutter SDK to avoid compatibility
  issues.
- By default, Flutter does not enable occlusion out of the box. Developers need to
  use the OccludeWrapper class.
- Ensure that all sensitive data is hidden before releasing your app to production.
- By default, Flutter does not enable occlusion out of the box.
- Avoid using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless a Data Processing Agreement
  (DPA) is signed.
- Requires AndroidX enabled in config.xml
- Follow the initialization steps for different frameworks
- Automatic Tagging not available in Cordova due to the nature of how activities/screens
  are managed.
- When occluding sensitive data, you still have the option to record gestures for
  those views or screens.
- Sensitive information is hidden directly on the device by applying red boxes or
  blurring.
- Your integration process is complete. Start reviewing sessions in the dashboard
  and explore UXCam's powerful features to get more insights into your app's user
  experience.
- 'Automatic Tagging: Convenient and suitable for simple integration.'
- 'Manual Tagging: More customizable, allowing you to assign meaningful tags to screens
  and enhance the quality of your analytics.'
- Sensitive information will be hidden under red boxes or blurred screens on the device
  before rendering the video and therefore never sent to UXCam.
- When hiding sensitive information, you still have the option to record gestures
  for that view or screen. However, if you’re hiding passwords or other sensitive
  inputs, we recommend also disabling gesture recording.
- When hiding sensitive information, you still have the option to record gestures
  for that view or screen.
- Avoid using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without a Data Processing
  Agreement (DPA).
- 'Automatic Tagging: Limited due to NativeScript''s lifecycle events.'
- 'Manual Tagging: Provides specific names for screens or allows more meaningful tags
  for your analytics.'
- Avoid using Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as email addresses or
  phone numbers.
- If your website uses a Content Security Policy (CSP), you’ll need to explicitly
  allow UXCam resources for the Web SDK to function properly.
- Flutter Web is at the moment not supported
- Refer to optional steps. Ship steps 1-5, to get the most value out of UXCam
- Your App Key can be found in the dashboard.
- Make sure the UXCam script is loaded before the event fires.
- Always sanitize and validate dynamic values being pushed to UXCam.
- Active Shopify account with theme editing access required
- UXCam App Key found in UXCam dashboard under Settings > Project Settings
- Ensure UXCam functionality is applied to every screen on your Shopify website.
- Dynamically set user identity and attributes using Liquid tags.
- For setting up UXCam through Google Tag Manager, make sure you have a Google Tag
  Manager account set up with your WordPress site.
- Hide sensitive user data through automatic and customisable occlusion
- Ensure the Web SDK functions correctly
- Occlusion is a data privacy technique used to mask or hide sensitive information
  from being recorded or exposed during analytics tracking.
- Enables occlusion of sensitive data in URLs and query parameters.
- Query parameters to be occluded should be listed under queryParams.
- Always define your pages if your URLs contain dynamic path parameters or fragments.
- If screen names are not manually defined, UXCam defaults to displaying the URL path
  as the screen name.
- Dynamic URLs with path parameters or fragments can clutter reports.
- Maintaining clean and consistent page names in reports is essential.
- Allows logging of user interactions and key behaviours.
- Event names and properties can be captured for insights.
- CSP ensures the security of your website by controlling which external resources
  are allowed.
- Setting the appVersion helps you track analytics and debug issues across different
  releases more effectively.
- Session ends automatically after 3 minutes of no data from the client.
- Please ensure that you've replaced 'Your_App_Key' at the bottom of the snippet with
  the app key located in your UXCam platform.
- Your plan includes web session recording. You can request a web trial by clicking
  on Request Trial on your subscription page or simply by reaching out to our support
  team via team@uxcam.com.
- By default, automatic screen name tagging is set to true
- This approach can be extended to other methods such as sending events and occluding
  sensitive views within the webview.
- This feature is only available from SDK plugin v1.0.7 onwards
- Flutter does not support text input occlusion, either from dashboard or code.
- Hiding sensitive Views needs to be handled from code.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Blur radius customization is available.
- Sensitive views can be occluded.
- This page refers only to specific occlusion methods when using Jetpack Compose.
- This feature is only available in versions 2.3.0+ of the UXCam Flutter SDK
- Uses uxcam-occlude class to handle sensitive views in webviews.
- By default, UXCam generates a random alias name to identify your users based on
  the Install ID.
- We recommend not sending PII data, such as email address or phone number, and instead,
  send your own and unique User ID to UXCam.
- 'API parameters are: propertyName and value'
- UXCam automatically detects UI Freezes and Rage taps and logs them as an event.
- If you pass more than the limit 20 properties for a single event, instead, an event
  called _UXCam_Overload will appear mentioning the limit has been exceeded for that
  event.
- API allows you to control when the session gets recorded
- Pausing session recording stops capturing session data temporarily.
- Pausing video recording stops UXCam from recording videos during sessions.
- Crash handling is enabled by default
- You can enable/disable crash handling, report non-fatal (handled) exceptions and
  events
- 'The API parameters are: exception: Exception object. properties: (Optional) A Dictionary
  of properties to associate with this exception. Only number and string property
  types are supported.'
- A maximum of five concurrent requests per second.
- A maximum of 500 requests per hour.
- A Total number of 500 records can be fetched on a single request.
- Please do not use whitespace in request query parameters.
- Uxcam Data Access APIs support ISO-8601 format (zulu format)
- API provides aggregated data of users based on query grouped by attributes.
- To authenticate the event analytics API, app id and API key are required.
- Quantitative data is grouped by device model.
- Verification failed? Verify your `appKey` and SDK version match the dashboard. Ensure
  network connectivity and firewall allow SDK requests.
- Uploads stuck or failing? Inspect `Session await upload remained` warnings. Check
  individual file-type errors for more details.
- Still stuck? Gather full log output and share with Support/CS for deeper analysis.
- Uses middleware integration to connect Segment with UXCam
- This middleware only allows to send data from Segment to UXCam, it is not both ways.
- You're able to send any amount of events to the middleware, however please keep
  in mind that UXCam will only record up to the maximum event count your account has
  in your subscription.
- Events in Firebase can take up to 24 hours to appear in the dashboard
- Attach your Intercom user’s IDs to UXCam by sending them as user properties.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Intercom
- You can view your tracked event from Mixpanel activity feed.
- Ensure that the YourApp User ID field (YourApp_User_Id__c) is correctly populated
  in Salesforce.
- Replace YOURAPPID in the URL with the actual UXCam App ID for your organization.
- If the link does not work, double-check the query string formatting and confirm
  that the YourApp User ID exists in UXCam.
- Always use completion handler when starting UXCam
- Check URL before integrating
- Contains iOS Fix for 4XX error fallback to offline session recordings

- If you have successfully integrated the Flutter SDK but are still seeing 'Waiting
  for data to arrive' in your dashboard, ensure the app is sent to the background
  and not fully closed.
- Requires AndroidX to be enabled in config.xml
- 'Important: Flutter Web is at the moment not supported'
- Sending additional user properties will help you have a better understanding of
  your users’ actions, create segments, and discover how behavior changes between
  different audiences.
- 'The API parameters are: propertyName: The name of the property to attach to the
  user. value: A value to associate with the property. String or Number are accepted
  for value.'
