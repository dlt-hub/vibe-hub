notes:
- Requires OAuth2 authorization with a callback URL of http://localhost:33333
- Access tokens are stored in a specified .TXT file
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- It is possible to populate the JobExecutionLogs table by relating the Id field from
  All job logs_TX_Root to the JobExecutionId from JobExecutionLogs.
- Supports incremental load (v. 11.0 or later)
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- POST body must be in JSON format.
- Authentication Failure When Querying REST API Endpoint Due to Lowercase 'bearer'
  in Authorization Header for TimeXtender REST data source
- Uses OAuth2 with client credentials
- Requires application rights for client authentication
- Requires Application rights for client authentication.
- Use .default scope for token.
- You do not need to add a stop condition as it will automatically stop once it can’t
  find the nextLink part in the XML page.
- Due to pagination the value_id is reset for each page.
- The REST API Endpoint currently only supports tables (i.e. views are not currently
  supported)
- The API Key needs to be setup in order to use the TimeXtender API endpoints.
- The Job Logs Endpoint provides insights related to job executions.
- The logs are based on the execution logs and if it is like the other log options
  it will be present for 90 days.
- 'Response is a valid JSON but has a Content-Type: text/plain.'
- 'Setting Accept: application/json in request headers results in a response wrapped
  in a string.'
- API does not accept Content-Type = x-www-form-urlencoded, requires application/json.
- The API is just not accepting Content-Type = x-www-form-urlencoded, which is what
  the portal is configured to send.
- Query parameters need to be the correct case setting, e.g., 'page' instead of 'Page'.
- Use correct case for query parameters.
- Pagination does not apply on the first call.
- Pagination is enabled with a page size of 100.
- If I increase it more than 200 I get http 400 error.
