notes:
- 'Flow run errors are often caused by one of the following factors: The Workflows
  app isn''t installed in Microsoft Teams – Install the Workflows app in Microsoft
  Teams.'
- 'Improperly formatted JSON – This is not usually as complex as one might expect.
  These are most often just situations where: There are curly quotes, or missing quotes,
  around values within the JSON.'
- You can validate the format of your JSON by pasting the JSON into the Card Payload
  Editor.
- Missing Image URLs – All image values within Adaptive Cards must refer to a valid
  URL.
- Check that placeholder values, text styles, and any markup language align with Adaptive
  Card schema requirements.
- Access to this page requires authorization.
- Important to configure the reporting mailbox as a SecOps mailbox.
- The report submission policy named DefaultReportSubmissionPolicy is created with
  the default values.
- The default settings include Send reported messages to Microsoft and my reporting
  mailbox with a blank value for the reporting mailbox.
- Turning off reporting in Outlook disables the built-in Report button across all
  platforms.
- If you change the email address of the reporting mailbox in the report submission
  rule, be sure to change the corresponding values in the report submissions policy.
- The only supported method for importing PST files to Microsoft 365 is to use the
  AzCopy tool.
- Each PST file that you upload to the Azure Storage location should be no larger
  than 20 GB.
- Don't change anything in the header row, including the SharePoint parameters; they
  will be ignored during the PST Import process.
- To import more than 500 PST files, you have to create multiple mapping files and
  create multiple import jobs.
