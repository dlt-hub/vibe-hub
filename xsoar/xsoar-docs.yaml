- After 90 days, support for this Pack moved to the partner on MONTH, DAY, YEAR.
- Certification is the process by which Cortex XSOAR validates and marks the quality
  of the Content Pack.
- Certified Packs indicate the highest level of quality and reliability in our ecosystem.
- As part of Cortex XSOAR Partner enablement, our Partner Success Engineers listed
  some helpful videos below for guidance when contributing a pack to the XSOAR Marketplace.
- Cortex XSOAR is an orchestration and automation system used to bring all of the
  various pieces of your security apparatus together.
- Follow the Best Practices as much as possible.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Integration should include the isFetchCredentials Parameter
- Logo must be under 10kb. Make sure to use the company logo (not the product’s).
- Context limitation, If the result contains more than 50 entries, limit the context
  size.
- Cortex XSOAR offers a built-in platform IDE which is available through the product's
  web UI.
- The PyCharm plugin is no longer supported.
- If during the installation one or more Python packages fail to install, the installation
  will proceed and create the virtual environment with the packages that were installed.
- Make sure Docker is running.
- Make sure that Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password) is
  enabled in Docker advanced settings.
- If Docker is running try to clean up Docker or sign in to Docker to avoid the Docker
  pull rate limit.
- If you are not planning to contribute or your contribution will be only community
  supported, the content in this article is not required.
- For complex solutions and supported contributions, you will probably need a combination
  of both the Cortex XSOAR UI and other tools.
- In order to establish a proper release timeframe for your contribution, you are
  required to respond (and apply requested changes, if any) within 14 days.
- Stale pull requests with no response within this timeframe will be closed.
- Contributed content for Palo Alto Networks products will be adopted and supported
  by the Cortex XSOAR Content team.
- If you are not sure whether you should read this, more details can be found here.
- New contributed content packs, should have all their available content entities
  supported from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0.
- Updating JavaScript integrations/scripts in an existing pack is not supported.
- The purpose of the demo is to make sure the contribution is up to Cortex XSOAR standards
  and to ensure that everything works as expected while providing a good UX.
- The demo should take up to an hour (based on the PR size).
- The review process won't start if those forms remain unfilled.
- Stale Pull Requests might be closed.
- The author image must be named Author_image.png and saved in the root directory
  of the pack.
- If the Author_image.png file does not exist, the name of the author will be displayed
  under the 'PUBLISHER' section instead.
- Last updated on 8/20/2024
- When an Integration or Automation Script is exported from Cortex XSOAR using `demisto-sdk
  download`, the Unified YAML is automatically split in its components.
- When an Integration or Automation Script is imported into Cortex XSOAR using `demisto-sdk
  upload`, the Integration/Automation directory files are automatically assembled
  in the Unified YAML file that gets uploaded.
- If you want to live a life of shame and disappoint your team, you can opt to not
  run any tests by adding `No test - <reason>` as a test you would like to run.
- The MaxMind GeoIP2 integration allows you to query the MaxMind API service and retrieve
  a JSON of all details.
- This type of parameter is used for encrypted inputs, such as API tokens.
- This type of parameter is used to allow selecting a single input from a list of
  allowed inputs.
- Size up to 10KB.
- Dimensions of 120x50.
- Transparent background.
- Cortex XSOAR supports also JavaScript integrations and scripts.
- All new integrations and scripts should be written in Python 3.
- Python 2 is supported only for existing integrations and scripts.
- To avoid unexpected issues, it is important to wrap your command block in a 'Try-Catch'.
- Raise exceptions in the code where needed, but in the main catch them and use the
  `return_error` function.
- If the `return_error` second argument is error, you can pass Exception object.
- You can always use `demisto.error("some error message")` to log your error.
- The default fetch interval is 1 minute.
- The value of demisto.getLastRun() is not stored between CLI command runs; it is
  only stored in the incident fetch flow on the server side.
- It is best practice to specify how far back in time to fetch incidents on the first
  run.
- The fetch limit should be set to a maximum of 200 incidents per fetch.
- returning an empty list will keep the status as ok but no new incidents are created.
- Reputation commands usually should return DBotScore object
- The integration name should match the name defined in the YAML file.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Autofocus
- Uses CVE data to provide vulnerabilities information
- DBotScore can be derived from confidence levels
- Cortex XSOAR organizes incident data in a tree of objects called the Incident Context.
- DBot requires a very specific dataset, you must format the data according to this
  article.
- It is not possible to use the Cortex XSOAR Transformers (DT) within the DBot score
  context.
- Starting in Demisto 5.0, you can specify in the Cortex XSOAR IDE the Python version
  (2.7 or 3.x). Once you choose 3.x, the latest Cortex XSOAR Python 3 Docker image
  will be selected automatically.
- You can use this command to mark a playbook task as completed.
- You can use this command to reopen a closed incident.
- mypy introduced the `ignore[<error-name>]` syntax only in version 0.730.
- This would usually be from old code written before the support for `error-name`
  ignores.
- Unit testing should be used to test small units of code in an isolated and deterministic
  fashion.
- Unit tests should avoid performing communication with external APIs and should prefer
  to use mocking.
- The `demisto-sdk lint` by default prints out minimal output. If for some reason
  it is failing and not clear, run the script with `-v` for verbose output.
- 'When running mypy against python 2 code and the file contains non-ascii characters
  it may fail with an error of the sort: `can''t decode file ''ThreatConnect.py'':
  ''ascii'' codec can''t decode byte 0xe2 in position 47329: ordinal not in range(128)`.
  To find the character use the following python one liner: `python -c "index = 47329;
  f = open(''Integrations/ThreatConnect/ThreatConnect.py''); d = f.read(); print(d[index-20:index+20])"`.'
- 'The script creates a container image which is used to run pytest and pylint. The
  container image will be named: `devtest<origin-image>-[deps hash]`. For example:
  `devtestdemisto/python:1.3-alpine-1b9f5bee16a24c3f5463e324c1bb075`. You can examine
  the image if needed by simple using docker run. For example: docker run --rm -it
  devtestdemisto/python:1.3-alpine-1b9f5bee16a24c3f5463e324c1bb075e sh.'
- 'If you have faced the error `ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8` when running `demisto-sdk
  lint`, add these lines to your ~/.bash_profile: export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 export
  LANG=en_US.UTF-8.'
- Test Playbooks provide full End to End testing.
- Test Playbooks will not run in the CI for packs that are not supported by Cortex
  XSOAR.
- Both demisto.results() and sys.exit() should not be part of your final code.
- Debug feature is disabled by default. You will need to enable it at the tenant level.
- Feed integrations allow fetching indicators from feeds, for example TAXII, AutoFocus,
  Office 365.
- Feed integrations allow fetching indicators from feeds, for example TAXII, AutoFocus,
  Office 365, and so on.
- Every Event Collection integration should have the isfetchevents key in the integration
  YAML file, to indicate that this integration is a Collection integration.
- 'A Collection integration''s YAML file must have the fromversion: 6.8.0 field.'
- Collection integrations are only supported in XSIAM.
- The IAM integration supports basic management operations for user provisioning.
- Uses PowerShell for developing Automations and Integrations
- PowerShell is supported for developing Automations and Integrations.
- Use the command line params `--no-pwsh-analyze` and `--no-pwsh-test` to skip either
  the PSScriptAnalyzer or unit testing.
- In order to fetch credentials, the vault integration needs to retrieve credential
  objects in the format of a username and password (key:value).
- When the parameter is set to true, Cortex XSOAR will fetch credentials from the
  vault integration.
- Demisto v5.0 or later is required.
- The integration must be written in Python.
- Occasionally, you might need to store data between integration commands runs.
- A common use-case would be storing API tokens which have expiration time (i.e. JWT).
- Use return_results on GetModifiedRemoteDataResponse to make it work.
- For Cortex XSOAR versions 6.1.0 and earlier, once an incident field is changed manually
  within Cortex XSOAR, it is marked as "dirty" and will not be updated by the mirroring
  process in Cortex XSOAR throughout the incident lifecycle.
- However, if outbound mirroring is enabled, any changes to the incident in Cortex
  XSOAR will still be reflected in the external system.
- 'To prevent the incident type from changing during mirroring: If your integration
  instance does not fetch incidents, do not set a default incident type, and remove
  the classifier. Set up a second integration instance without classification that
  uses the same mapper. Set the second integration as Do not use by default so playbook
  command executions use the first integration instance.'

- 'The following incident fields must be configured either in the integration or in
  the integration instance mapping: dbotMirrorDirection, dbotMirrorId, dbotMirrorInstance,
  dbotDirtyFields, dbotCurrentDirtyFields, dbotMirrorLastSync, dbotMirrorTags.'
- Advanced users can extract the schedule metadata and use it when scheduling the
  future script execution.
- The generation currently supports integrations only.
- This is the Hello World integration for getting started.
- If the start time in the current fetch is the same as the start time in the previous
  fetch, the fetch_limit may be different from the fetch_limit_param.
- Fetching incidents is flexible and you can use the various functions according to
  your needs.
- You can also use the generic methods for regular fetch-incidents without lookback.
- During a fetch-incidents run, some edge-case scenarios may cause missing incidents
  from the third-party product.
- The most common scenarios are indexing issues in the product and an update in the
  incident information.
- This functionality is not currently available for Cortex XSOAR 6.x. Using `engine_placeholder`
  in Cortex XSOAR 6.x UI will create a non-functional parameter with the name `engine_placeholder`.
- Playbooks can be attached to incidents to automate related tasks.
- Quiet Mode improves performance by increasing playbook speed and saving database
  size, for example, when processing indicators from threat intel feeds.
- 'Specify `auto-extract` settings for every possible task in the ''Advanced'' tab
  (tasks such as conditions or section headers don''t support this). Rule of thumb:
  set to None, unless the data printed to war room contains crucial indicators.'
- When outputting to context in integrations or scripts, use generic descriptions.
- Set defaults for playbook inputs when needed.
- The playbooks are used by everyone, try to avoid 'programming terms' when possible.
- When working with indicators or data that should be unique, make sure to use 'Uniq'
  (or 'Unique' in 5.0) transformers to prevent as many duplications as possible. Do
  it in playbook inputs as well.
- Avoid using [DT] wherever things can be done without it.
- 'The priority in playbook looks is: understanding of flow > readability of lines
  > aesthetics'
- Avoid headers as timer starters / stoppers
- Conditional tasks can determine different paths for your playbook.
- Users interact with the survey directly from the message
- Responses are collected and recorded in the incident's context data
- For more information about customized messages for communication tasks, see the
  Cortex XSOAR Administrator's Guide
- 'The default SOC name is Your SOC team. To change the default SOC name: Add the
  key soc.name, and add the display name of your SOC as the value.'
- Add the key messages.html.formats.externalFormSubmit, and add the following HTML
  with your customizations as the value.
- If the polling timeout is reached, the playbook finishes. Be sure to validate that
  the remote process was completed.
- Global context is not supported.
- GenericPolling doesn't work correctly in the Playground, thus, testing should be
  done within an incident.
- The output value is dynamic and is derived from the context at the time that the
  task is processed.
- Only events ingested through integrations or the REST API are processed through
  the classification engine.
- Prior to Cortex XSOAR 6.0, each incident layout tab, when exported, was a separate
  file.
- From Cortex 6.0 and later, all incident layout tabs can be exported as a single
  file containing the complete incident layout.
- When trying to download a content update, you receive a warning message about conflicts
  with custom incident fields.
- Click Install Content to force the update and retain your custom incident field.
- Creating Incident Fields should be an iterative process.
- Before creating a new Incident Field, check for existing fields.
- Jobs can be time-triggered or feed-triggered.
- Time-triggered jobs can use cron expressions for scheduling.
- Classifier and mapper files structure differs before and after Cortex XSOAR version
  6.0.
- Cortex XSOAR version 6.0 introduces an improved classification & mapping experience,
  which includes a mirroring functionality by allowing to map outgoing incidents.
- Classification determines the type of incident created for events ingested from
  a specific integration.
- Attributes are not mapped to any fields by default.
- Rules are applied in descending order, and only one rule is applied per incident.
- The Lists directory is Packs/<pack_name>/Lists/.
- Uses regular expression and formatting script to extract URLs
- 'defaultvalue: ''true'''
- Create relationships between indicators as part of enrichment.
- When writing Description.md, README.md and even release notes files like 1_1_1.md,
  some text may be relevant to a specific product like Cortex XSOAR, but not to others,
  such as Cortex XSIAM or vice versa.
- Rather than creating separate documents, you can add the following format to the
  release notes, Description.md or README.md documents.
- Streamline Investigation and remediation of Phishing incidents. Playbook engages
  with users while simultaneously investigates and enriches.
- New packs do not require release notes. The build process automatically creates
  the initial release notes.
- Release notes should be simple, informative, and clearly written.
- Documentation is a critical step that assists customers who may use your integration/script/playbook
  by providing insight into how the content entity is supposed to work.
- 'You can use the following API Key: 43ea9b2d-4998-43a6-ae91-aba62a26868c'
- In order to build a full fledged integration, you'll need to lint your code, run
  unit tests with pytest, create some documentation, submit your changes via git and
  more.
- Don't worry about the .python-version file warning, that is generated by pyenv and
  shouldn't be added to the repository.
- If everything worked fine so far, now you can push to your branch.
- 'Make sure that the required version of Python is available: 3.10.5'
- If you are using WSL and you see some errors about 'python.exe' getting called,
  disable it in App Execution Alias.
- Codespaces generated from the Content repository (or a fork of it) are configured
  to have 4 cores by default.
- You will receive an automated email notification when you have used 75%, 90%, and
  100% of your freely-included quotas.
- This is a tutorial to set up a fully functional development environment in a Docker
  container.
- 'Integration Parameters: Brief and clear names with snake_case (i.e. min_severity).'
- 'Command Names: Explicit !vendor-action-object with kebab-case (i.e. !helloworld-get-alert).'
- 'Command Arguments: Brief and clear names with snake_case (i.e. alert_id).'
- 'Command Outputs: Explicit Vendor.Object.data with PascalCase for the Vendor and
  Object block (i.e. HelloWorld.Alert.owner.name).'
- Make sure you understand and follow our Code Conventions to dramatically simplify
  the implementation and the review process
- The free service does not require an API key, and allows up to 60 API calls a day
  with up to 5 calls an hour.
- Many integrations that connect to third party services require an API key for authentication,
  which is sent with every request to the third party service.
- The Yoda Speak integration doesn't need to fetch incidents/alerts, so ensure this
  checkbox is empty.
- When Use system proxy settings is set to True, the integration runs using the proxy
  server (HTTP or HTTPS) defined in the server configuration.
- Command names should follow 'brand-function' name formatting convention.
- Unlike parameters, arguments are specific to each command.
- The Yoda Speak integration doesn't need to fetch incidents/alerts.
- When using the Yoda Speak API with an API key, the API key is passed as a header.
- In some cases, the URL parameter may be used for third party services that allow
  you to connect to more than one server, such as servers in different geographic
  regions, for example https://login.example.de or https://login.example.com.
- The text argument cannot be empty.
- Creating an Integration, we are
- In some cases, the URL parameter may be used for third party services that allow
  you to connect to more than one server, such as servers in different geographic
  regions, for example <https://login.example.de> or <https://login.example.com>.
- You don't need to enter an API key, but will instead use the free option with a
  limited number of API calls.
- If you have an integration open in two different tabs, you may encounter an error
  where your changes aren’t saved.
