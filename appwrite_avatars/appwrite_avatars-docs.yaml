auth_info:
- information_source; https://appwrite.io/docs/apis/rest:
  - Appwrite supports two authentication methods. For API key authentication, include
    the X-Appwrite-Project header with your project ID and X-Appwrite-Key header with
    your API key. For JWT authentication, include the X-Appwrite-Project header with
    your project ID and X-Appwrite-JWT header with a JWT token obtained from the Create
    JWT endpoint, which allows server applications to act on behalf of authenticated
    users.
  - 'Appwrite uses multiple authentication methods via HTTP headers. For server-to-server
    requests, include the required X-Appwrite-Project header with your project ID,
    and optionally X-Appwrite-Key with your API key for service-to-service authentication
    or X-Appwrite-JWT with a JWT token for user authentication. For client integrations,
    create account sessions via POST to the Account API endpoint, which returns Set-Cookie
    headers that persist the session as secured cookies for subsequent requests. Include
    Content-Type: application/json with requests, and optionally X-Appwrite-Response-Version
    for API versioning and X-Fallback-Cookies for fallback cookie handling.'
  - Session-based authentication uses cookies set in the Set-Cookie response headers
    (a_session_61e71ec784ab035f7259_legacy and a_session_61e71ec784ab035f7259) which
    are then sent in subsequent requests via the Cookie header along with the X-Appwrite-Project
    header containing the project ID. Server integrations use API key authentication
    by passing the X-Appwrite-key header with an API key value that has appropriate
    scopes.
  - X-Appwrite-Project header (required) must contain your Appwrite project ID. X-Appwrite-Key
    header (optional) must contain your API key for server-side authentication. Both
    headers are sent with multipart form data requests for file uploads, along with
    required Content-Type and Content-Range headers that specify the multipart boundary
    and byte range information.
- information_source; https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/oauth2:
  - Appwrite uses OAuth2 for authentication. Set your API endpoint and project ID
    via setEndpoint() and setProject(), then call createOAuth2Session() with an OAuth
    provider (e.g., OAuthProvider.GITHUB) and desired scopes (e.g., 'repo', 'user').
    For React Native/Expo, configure the URL scheme as "appwrite-callback-<PROJECT_ID>"
    in app.json, generate a deep link with makeRedirectUri(), pass it to createOAuth2Token()
    to get a login URL, open it in a browser, listen for the redirect callback, and
    create a session with the returned secret.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account:
  - Use limit and offset query parameters for pagination on the GET /account/logs
    endpoint. The queries parameter accepts an array of query strings where only limit
    and offset methods are supported to control page size and starting position.
- information_source; https://appwrite.io/threads/1136317870092062881:
  - The new version uses the queries parameter for pagination. Use queries[]=limit(100)
    to set the result limit, and queries[]=cursorAfter(documentId) to paginate using
    cursor-based navigation instead of the older cursor parameter syntax.
