notes:
- Every request you make is transmitted to the PubChem servers, evaluated, and then
  a response is sent back.
- It is less suitable for confidential work, it requires a constant internet connection.
- Beware that line notation inputs like SMILES and InChI can return automatically
  generated records that aren’t actually present in PubChem.
- These types of search are slow.
- If there are too many results for a request, you will receive a TimeoutError.
- When using PubChemPy behind a proxy, you may receive a URLError.
- The PUG REST API requires an internet connection
errors:
- '400: Request is improperly formed (e.g. syntax error in the URL or POST body).'
- '404: The input record was not found (e.g. invalid CID).'
- '405: Request not allowed (e.g. invalid MIME type in the HTTP Accept header).'
- '500: Some problem on the server side (e.g. a database server down).'
- '501: The requested operation has not (yet) been implemented by the server.'
- '503: Too many requests or server is busy, retry later.'
- '504: The request timed out, from server overload or too broad a request.'
