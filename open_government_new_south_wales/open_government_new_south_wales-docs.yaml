- information_source; https://api.nsw.gov.au/Documentation/GenerateHar/13:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used for authentication. Request an access token
    by sending client credentials (client_id and client_secret) to https://api.onegov.nsw.gov.au/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken,
    then use the returned access token in subsequent API requests to protected resources.
- information_source; https://api.nsw.gov.au/Documentation/PublishAPI:
  - API endpoints require authorization. To obtain an access token, submit an Authorization
    Header to a security endpoint with grant_type parameter. The response returns
    client_id (apikey) and access_token fields. For all other endpoints, include both
    client_id (as apikey parameter) and access_token (typically in Authorization header)
    along with other required parameters.

  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are provided as a base64-encoded
    string in the Authorization header with the scheme "Basic". The example shows
    client ID "N4kdFr0tvhubXAzKaBC4Me8AXCjRW5P4" and client secret "lC6ovzIPKyXc8oGo"
    encoded as "Basic TjRrZEZyMHR2aHViWEF6S2FCQzRNZThBWENqUlc1UDQ6bEM2b3Z6SVBLeVhjOG9Hbw==".
