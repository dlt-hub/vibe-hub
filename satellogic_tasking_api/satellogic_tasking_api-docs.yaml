auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.satellogic.com/getting-started/gettingstarted.html:
  - Aleph API uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for authentication. Exchange
    your Client ID and Client Secret with the token endpoint at https://auth.platform.satellogic.com/oauth/token
    using a POST request with JSON body containing client_id, client_secret, audience
    set to https://api.satellogic.com/, and grant_type set to client_credentials.
    The response provides an access_token valid for 24 hours that must be used in
    subsequent API requests.
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. Obtain an access
    token from https://auth.platform.satellogic.com/oauth/token by posting client_id,
    client_secret, audience set to "https://api.satellogic.com/", and grant_type set
    to "client_credentials". Include the access token in the authorizationToken header
    as "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" and include the X-Satellogic-Contract-Id header with
    your contract ID for all API requests.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication with a 24-hour expiration. Access tokens
    are obtained from a token endpoint and must be included in the authorizationToken
    header as "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" for all requests. Additionally, most endpoints
    require the X-Satellogic-Contract-Id header with a contract ID value. The token
    has associated scopes (e.g., api:tasking api:delivery) that define available permissions.
    Only the /contracts endpoint can be accessed without the contract ID header.
  - Use OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Obtain an access_token from a token endpoint,
    then include it in the AuthorizationToken header with format "Bearer {access_token}"
    when making API requests to https://api.satellogic.com endpoints.
- information_source; https://developers.satellogic.com/tasking-service/command_line_examples.html:
  - Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header and a contract
    ID in a custom header. The Authorization header must contain "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
    where ACCESS_TOKEN is your bearer token. Additionally, the X-Satellogic-Contract-Id
    header is required and must contain your contract ID value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.satellogic.com/tasking-service/command_line_examples.html:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes count
    (total results), next (URL for next page), previous (URL for previous page), and
    results array. Use the next URL to fetch subsequent pages until next is null.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination for list endpoints. Requests include optional
    query parameters limit (page size) and offset (starting position). Responses contain
    count (total items), next and previous (URLs for navigation or null when unavailable),
    and results (data array). Stop paginating when next is null.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination for task lists. Request parameters are limit
    (query, optional, default appears to be standard) and offset (query, optional,
    default 0). Response includes count (total items), next (URL for next page or
    null), previous (URL for previous page or null), and results (array of items).
    Stop paginating when next is null.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters. Request parameters
    are `offset` (optional, default 0) and `limit` (optional, controls page size).
    The response includes `count` (total results), `next` (URL to next page or null),
    `previous` (URL to previous page or null), and `results` (array of items). Stop
    paginating when `next` is null.
