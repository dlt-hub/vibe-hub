auth_info:
- information_source; https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/contentdeliveryapis/introduction/overview-policies-and-conventions/:
  - API key authentication is required and passed as a query parameter named api_key.
    The api_key identifies the account making the request, and can be used with account
    ID macros me (current account) or all (current account plus sub-accounts) in URL
    paths.
  - All requests must be authenticated using an app's API key passed either as the
    api_key query parameter or as the api-key header parameter. The API key should
    be kept secret and is required for every request.
- information_source; https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/eventsapis/introduction/overview-policies-and-conventions/:
  - 'All requests must be authenticated using one of three methods: API Key, Secure
    Access Token JWT, or OAuth. API Key and OAuth are sent via the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: KEY <apiKey/oauth>". Secure Access Token JWT is sent via the
    Authorization header using Bearer schema as "Bearer <bearerToken>". The Content-Type
    header must be set to application/json for all requests with a body. Unauthorized
    or improperly authenticated requests will fail and events will not be recorded.'
- information_source; https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/managementapis/introduction/overview-policies-and-conventions/:
  - API key authentication is required and sent as a query parameter. The API key
    is associated with an account, and requests must include the account ID in the
    URL path; the special macros "me" (current account) and "all" (current account
    plus sub-accounts) can be used instead of explicit account IDs in supported endpoints.
  - All requests must be authenticated using an app's API key passed either as the
    api_key query parameter or as the api-key header. The API key should be kept secret
    and must be included with every request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/managementapis/reviews/reviewmanagement/:
  - The response includes a "nextPageToken" string field for pagination. Use this
    token value as the query parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve the next
    page of results; continue paginating until no nextPageToken is returned.
  - pageToken is an optional string parameter used for pagination. If a response contains
    a pageToken, include it in the next request to retrieve the following page of
    results. Continue paginating until no pageToken is returned in the response.
- information_source; https://hitchhikers.yext.com/guides/create-pull-connector/02-specify-api-details/:
  - The YouTube API Search endpoint uses cursor pagination. The maxResults query parameter
    (optional, defaults to 5, set to desired page size) specifies how many results
    to return per page. Use the pageToken field from the response as the pageToken
    parameter in the next request to fetch additional pages.
  - The YouTube API uses cursor-based pagination with `nextPageToken` in the response
    body. When multiple pages exist, `nextPageToken` contains a token passed as the
    `pageToken` query parameter in the next request to fetch additional results.
