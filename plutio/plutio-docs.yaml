  - We use a standard OAuth 2 authentication method. You can generate an application
    key and a secret code from your settings page inside the Plutio app and use them
    to create a temporary access token. The YOUR_PLUTIO_SUBDOMAIN header value should
    be the first part of your Plutio domain. Visit the Getting Started section for
    complete token generation and usage details.
