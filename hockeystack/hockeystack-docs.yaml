- Using this report, we noticed that 27% of our ABM April ‘24 list did not have the
  average required LinkedIn Impressions to convert, so we carried those 18 accounts
  into a separate campaign to show more ads. Our sales people also noticed that the
  average deal is created after 3 LinkedIn DMs, but most of our LinkedIn outreach
  stops at the first message, so we gotta get those followups in.
