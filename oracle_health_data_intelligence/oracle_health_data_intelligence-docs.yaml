auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.healtheintent.com/:
  - Health Data Intelligence APIs support bearer token authentication as the preferred
    method, or alternatively two-legged OAuth 1.0a authentication. To authenticate,
    you need an Oracle system account with a bearer token, consumer key, and consumer
    secret. Bearer tokens are sent in request headers and may expire; OAuth 1.0a requires
    the consumer key and consumer secret for signature generation.
  - 'OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens are the recommended authentication method, though OAuth
    1.0a two-legged authentication is also supported. For OAuth 1.0a, send an HTTPS
    POST request to https://api.cernercare.com/oauth/access with Content-Type header
    set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded and include URL-encoded parameters in
    the POST body: oauth_consumer_key (your system account ID) and oauth_consumer_secret
    (your system account secret). Treat the system account secret with password-level
    security and rotate it routinely.'
  - The API requires Bearer token authentication passed via the Authorization header.
    Include the header 'Authorization' with value '<auth_header>' (a Bearer token)
    in all requests to the Legacy Health Record API endpoints.
  - The API requires bearer token authentication passed via the Authorization header.
    Include the header 'Authorization' with the value '<auth_header>' (a bearer token)
    in all requests. The Content-Type header should also be set to 'application/json'.
  - The authentication uses OAuth 1.0a with PLAINTEXT signature method. Credentials
    are sent in the Authorization header with oauth_consumer_key, oauth_token, oauth_signature_method
    set to PLAINTEXT, and oauth_signature parameters. The oauth_signature is computed
    as consumer_secret ampersand token_secret, both URL-encoded and joined with an
    ampersand.
