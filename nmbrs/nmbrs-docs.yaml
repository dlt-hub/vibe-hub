auth_info:
- information_source; https://nmbrs.stoplight.io/docs/nmbrs-restapi/ZG9jOjE5Nzc1OTky-getting-started:
  - The Nmbrs API uses OAuth 2.0 with Three-Legged OAuth (3LO) flow for authentication.
    Your application must obtain an access token from the Nmbrs authorization server
    after the resource owner grants permission, then include this token in API requests
    to access employee payroll and HR data.
  - The Nmbrs REST API uses OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow for authentication.
    This is a three-legged OAuth (3LO) flow where your app must securely store a client
    secret. Detailed implementation information is available in the authentication
    documentation.
- information_source; https://nmbrs.stoplight.io/docs/nmbrs-restapi/ZG9jOjY4OTAxNTQ-authentication:
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Users must first obtain an authorization
    code by redirecting to https://identityservice.nmbrs.com/connect/authorize with
    query parameters: client_id (provided by Nmbrs), state (unique identifier), scope
    (space-separated scopes like employee.employment.read, employee.info.read, employee.payment,
    company.info, company.info.read, company.payrollsettings.read, offline_access),
    response_type=code, and redirect_uri (pre-registered callback URL). The authorization
    code is returned to the redirect_uri, which is then exchanged for an access token.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with short-lived access tokens. Obtain access_token
    and refresh_token via POST to identityservice.nmbrs.com/connect/token using Basic
    authentication with clientId and clientSecret. Access tokens expire in 60 minutes;
    use refresh_token with grant_type=refresh_token to obtain new tokens. Call API
    endpoints with Authorization header "Bearer {{access_token}}" and X-Subscription-Key
    header containing subscription_key.
  - The API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow with Basic authentication for token
    exchange. To exchange an authorization code for an access token, make a POST request
    to /connect/token with Basic authentication using client_id and client_secret
    as credentials, sending grant_type=authorization_code, code, and redirect_uri
    in the request body. The response includes access_token (Bearer token, expires
    in 3600 seconds) and refresh_token (only if offline_access scope was requested).
    Authorization codes expire after 5 minutes.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://nmbrs.stoplight.io/docs/nmbrs-restapi/ZG9jOjY4OTAxNTQ-authentication:
  - pageNumber and pageSize are query parameters used for pagination. pageNumber specifies
    the page number to retrieve (starting from 1), and pageSize specifies the number
    of items per page (set to 20 in the example). The documentation does not specify
    default values, minimum/maximum constraints, or response fields indicating total
    pages or whether more data exists.
