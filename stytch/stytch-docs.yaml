- information_source; https://stytch.com/docs/api/overview:
  - Stytch uses HTTP Basic Authentication with PROJECT_ID as the username and SECRET
    as the password. Credentials are sent in the Authorization header using the format
    -u 'PROJECT_ID:{SECRET}' in curl, or configured directly in SDK clients. The SECRET
    is a sensitive credential that must be kept confidential and should not be exposed
    in client-side code.
