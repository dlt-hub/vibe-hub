notes:
- Supports nested subdocuments and virtual properties
- Nest aims to be a platform-agnostic framework.
- By default, if any error happens while creating the application your app will exit
  with the code 1.
- To create a basic controller, we use classes and decorators.
- To quickly create a CRUD controller with built-in validation, you can use the CLI's
  CRUD generator.
- Every Nest application has at least one module, the root module.
- Modules are highly recommended as an effective way to organize your components.
- Express and fastify handle middleware differently and provide different method signatures.
- Nest provides a built-in HttpException class and standard HTTP response objects.
- Custom exceptions can be created by extending the HttpException class.
- Uses Zod and class-validator libraries for validation.
- The `@UsePipes()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.
- The `zod` library requires the `strictNullChecks` configuration to be enabled in
  your `tsconfig.json` file.
- Dynamic modules must return an object with module properties.
- The register method must return a DynamicModule.
- Singleton scope is used by default and does not need to be declared.
- Websocket Gateways should not use request-scoped providers because they must act
  as singletons.
- Using request-scoped providers will have an impact on application performance.
- If you want to register the payload for a durable tree, use the specified construction.
- The ContextIdFactory class is imported from the @nestjs/core package.
- Lazy loading can help decrease bootstrap time by loading only modules required by
  the specific serverless function invocation.
- Lazy loaded modules cannot be registered as global modules.
- Lifecycle hooks give visibility into key lifecycle events.
- Shutdown hooks need to be enabled first.
- Keep your e2e test files inside the test directory. The testing files should have
  a .e2e-spec suffix.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- ConfigService can retrieve configuration values from environment variables.
- 'Setting synchronize: true shouldn''t be used in production - otherwise you can
  lose production data.'
- Sequelize supports multiple relational databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft
  SQL Server, SQLite, and MariaDB.
- Best practice to validate the correctness of any data sent into a web application.
- The ValidationPipe can automatically transform payloads to be objects typed according
  to their DTO classes.
- Only GET endpoints are cached.
- HTTP server routes that inject the native response object (@Res()) cannot use the
  Cache Interceptor.
- Versioning allows you to version controllers, individual routes, and also provides
  a way for certain resources to opt-out of versioning.
- If versioning is enabled for the application but the controller or route does not
  specify the version, any requests to that controller/route will be returned a 404
  response status.
- Task scheduling allows you to schedule arbitrary code (methods/functions) to execute
  at a fixed date/time, at recurring intervals, or once after a specified interval.
- Uses JavaScript setTimeout() function under the hood.
- BullMQ is actively developed with modern TypeScript implementation.
- Bull is in maintenance mode and remains a reliable choice.
- Job handlers can also be run in a separate (forked) process.
- Consumers must be registered as providers so the @nestjs/bullmq package can pick
  them up.
- Uses built-in text-based logger.
- Supports integration with external logging systems.
- Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application.
- Events triggered before or during the onApplicationBootstrap lifecycle hook may
  be missed.
- Multer cannot process data which is not in the supported multipart format (`multipart/form-data`)
- 'Warning: FileInterceptor() may not be compatible with third party cloud providers
  like Google Firebase or others.'
- Fastify, by default, can support sending files without needing to call stream.pipe(res),
  so you don't need to use the StreamableFile class at all.
- Axios can be configured with a variety of options to customize the behavior of the
  HttpService.
- The default server-side session storage is purposely not designed for a production
  environment.
- It will leak memory under most conditions, does not scale past a single process,
  and is meant for debugging and developing.
- Nest, by default, makes use of the Express library under the hood.
- The Fastify API has a few differences, but the end result of these method calls
  is the same.
- Fastify provides a good alternative framework for Nest because it solves design
  issues in a similar manner to Express.
- Server-Sent Events routes must return an Observable stream.
- JWT token is issued upon successful login
- JWT has an expiration of 60 seconds.
- Authorization is orthogonal and independent from authentication.
- In real-world applications, you may have endpoints/handlers that involve several
  operations, in which each of them requires a specific set of permissions.
- Nest itself does not provide any additional package on top of the crypto module
  to avoid introducing unnecessary abstractions.
- CORS can be enabled with default settings or customized via configuration object.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- '@nestjs/graphql@>=9 and @nestjs/apollo^10 packages are compatible with Apollo v3'
- The default Apollo playground has been deprecated and will be removed in the next
  major release.
- Uses TypeScript decorators to define GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- Using the @Resolver decorator at the method level is not supported with the code
  first approach.
- It is helpful to organize your code by your so-called domain model.
- Recommended to observe the convention that any operations that cause writes should
  be sent explicitly via a mutation.
- The installSubscriptionHandlers configuration option has been removed from the latest
  version of Apollo server.
- Default scalar types include Int, Float, String, Boolean, and ID.
- GraphQLISODateTime is used by default to represent the Date type.
- Directives can be applied on fields, field resolvers, input and object types, as
  well as queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
- TypeScript interfaces cannot be used to define GraphQL interfaces.
- All decorators are exported from the @nestjs/graphql package.
- Field middleware can be applied only to ObjectType classes.
- Query complexity allows you to define how complex certain fields are, and to restrict
  queries with a maximum complexity.
- This plugin is opt-in.
- The plugin adds appropriate decorators on-the-fly based on the Abstract Syntax Tree.
- Federation currently does not support subscriptions.
- Mercurius doesn't fully support Federation 2.
- Gateways can be treated as providers; this means they can inject dependencies through
  the class constructor.
- Gateways are not instantiated until they are referenced in the providers array of
  an existing module.
- Web sockets exception filters behave equivalently to HTTP exception filters.
- Use WsException for errors in web sockets
- Pipes are applied only to the data parameter
- The WebSockets module is platform-agnostic.
- Messages exchanged through channels are fire-and-forget, meaning if there are no
  subscribers, the message is removed and cannot be recovered.
- A communication system built on MQTT consists of the publishing server, a broker
  and one or more clients.
- Uses Kafka microservices for messaging
- 'To disable auto-committing of messages set autoCommit: false in the run configuration.'
- Supports full-duplex streaming using gRPC
- The BidiHello method streams requests to the service
- Global microservice exception filters aren't enabled by default when using a hybrid
  application.
- Use NODE_ENV=production when running your application in production.
- This is a basic Dockerfile that sets up a Node.js environment, installs the application
  dependencies, builds the NestJS application, and runs it.
- You can customize this file based on your project requirements.
- Standalone application does not have any network listeners, so any Nest features
  related to HTTP (e.g., middleware, interceptors, pipes, guards, etc.) are not available
  in this context.
- Nest CLI requires a Node.js binary built with internationalization support (ICU)
- Monorepo mode employs the concept of a workspace to manage its member entities.
- Nest applications are pure TypeScript applications.
- Nest provides a set of short-hand API response decorators that inherit from the
  @ApiResponse decorator.
- The Swagger plugin will derive the @ApiProperty() annotations from the TypeScript
  types and class-validator decorators.
- Make sure to delete the /dist folder and rebuild your application whenever plugin
  options are updated.
- If you intend to rely on automatic annotations for generating documentations and
  still wish for runtime validations, then the class-validator decorators are still
  necessary.
- Find jest cache directory (usually /tmp/jest_rs)
- Remove or empty the Jest cache directory
- REPL is a simple interactive environment that takes single user inputs, executes
  them, and returns the result to the user.
- During development it is useful to run REPL in a watch mode to reflect all the code
  changes automatically.
- SWC is approximately x20 times faster than the default TypeScript compiler.
- If your repository is a monorepo, check out the section on monorepo.
- Unlike Jest, Vitest does not automatically resolve TypeScript path aliases like
  src/. This may lead to dependency resolution errors during testing.
- JWT expiration is set to 60 seconds.
- '@mikro-orm/nestjs is a third party package and is not managed by the NestJS core
  team'
- This chapter is only relevant to HTTP-based applications.
- This feature should be used very carefully, as overusing it can make code difficult
  to maintain over time.
- Terminus integration provides readiness/liveness health checks.
- Recommended to enable shutdown hooks in your application.
- Event handlers are executed asynchronously, so they must always handle exceptions
  properly to prevent the application from entering an inconsistent state.
- Errors in CommandHandlers can still be caught by built-in Exception filters.
- 'Errors in EventHandlers can''t be caught by Exception filters: you will have to
  handle them manually.'
- The default renderPath of the Static App is * (all paths), and the module will send
  'index.html' files in response.
- The option serveStaticOptions.fallthrough needs to be set to true to send 'index.html'
  instead of a 404 error for non existing route.
- nest-commander is a third party package and is not managed by the entirety of the
  NestJS core team.
- Necord is a third-party package and is not officially maintained by the NestJS core
  team.
- Text commands rely on message content, which is set to be deprecated for verified
  bots and applications with over 100 servers.
- To speed up development cycles, we install the serverless-offline plugin which emulates
  AWS λ and API Gateway.
- If you use @nestjs/swagger package, there are a few additional steps required to
  make it work properly in the context of serverless function.
- By default, the HTTP adapters of NestJS will wait until the response is finished
  before closing the application.
- Most users will not need to enable the forceCloseConnections option.
- This recipe does not work with GraphQL Subscriptions
- Middleware is executed in a particular sequence.
- Guard execution starts with global guards.
- Interceptors resolve from route to controller to global on response.
- Pipes follow the global to controller to route bound sequence.
- If you're using @nestjs/graphql package, install the latest version
- Never use DevtoolsModule in production
- Node.js v16 and v18 are no longer supported, NestJS 11 requires Node.js v20 or higher.
