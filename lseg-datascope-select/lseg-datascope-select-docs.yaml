- The API provides the ability to screen entity names, with or without secondary fields
  such as date of birth for individuals.
- Synchronous or asynchronous screening API requests are supported.
- Synchronous or asynchronous screening API requests.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api

- The LSEG COM Library for Workspace is a Desktop Data API designed to work with the
  LSEG Workspace desktop application.
- The Speed Guide tool registers for Snapshot only data content (i.e, non-streaming).
- Please sign in to explore content on this page.
- 'Workspace will not ship with the following legacy API components: 32-bit based
  COM APIs for use in Microsoft Office and Eikon 4 Desktop Data API (.NET)'
- Legacy APIs will be sunset in June 2025
- Users need to check for legacy components in workflows
- The Speed Guide utility allows users and developers who do not have access to the
  LSEG Workspace Desktop application to browse streaming content available from Delivery/Data
  Platform.
- Workspace will not ship with legacy API components such as 32-bit based COM APIs
  for use in Microsoft Office.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Manage country risk ranking, digital identity verification, document proofing and
  screening via one API.
- The Qual-ID API is a stateless web service based on RESTful architecture. The production
  endpoint is supported solely on HTTPS.
- The API uses built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication, errors and verbs
  which are understood by standard HTTP clients.
- The API supports synchronous and asynchronous screening requests.
- Response data is in JSON format.
- Provides access to standardized ESG data points and analytics.
- Data is available via multiple mechanisms depending on use case.
- Requires setup of connected app in World Check API
- Ensure to handle nulls in nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with client credentials — requires setup of connected app in api

- The Data Library provides a powerful set of interfaces for uniform access to LSEG
  data universe.
- The LSEG Data and Analytics ecosystem provides a rich data universe for AI projects.
- The API utilizes Refinitiv Data Platform for accessing the required data.
- Incorporates NLP based news sentiment variable for predictive modeling.
- In addition to the desktop session, I open the RDP platform session to be able to
  access news data on RDP.
- I am not opening only platform session because eikon legacy functions (such as rdp.legacy.get_data)
  raise the attribute error below on the platform session. This is going to be solved
  in upcoming API versions.
- Includes only public companies classified as targets.
- Excludes acquisitions of majority or partial interest.
- Excludes very small deals with transaction values less than USD 100 mln.
- Data retrieval takes a relatively long time.
- The dataset may contain duplicates as many target companies have the same peers.
- Data retrieval takes a relatively long time, store in an excel file once code is
  executed.
- The dataset consists of 182 target and 3648 non-target companies totaling 3849 companies.
- Consider selecting up to the seven closest peers per target company to maintain
  a similar distribution.
- Dataset contains 1339 rows and 16 columns
- Requests news headlines for the specified period.
- Focuses on headline text to reduce API call overhead.
- Daily API call limit of 10,000 requests
- BERT RNA is trained with max sentence length set as 512 tokens.
- Average length of our text input is 127.0.
- BERT RNA expects a CSV structure with a single column for the text.
- Uses multiple ML techniques for predictive modeling
- Sample size for target companies is very small for robust predictive results
- ROC_AUC score is the main accuracy metric for models.
- Reported evaluation metrics are in line with the one from the random forest model.
- The dataset wasn't large enough to claim the robustness of the model's predictive
  power.
- Uses balanced scale_pos_weight parameter considering the imbalanced nature of the
  dataset.
- The ROC_AUC score is used as the main accuracy metric.
- The SearchBrowser module is designed to run within the Refinitiv Workspace/Eikon
  CodeBook environment.
- The SearchBrowser interface supports basic query expressions
- Applications written to WebSocket API protocol specification can connect to Real-Time
  Distributions System (RTDS) version 3.2.1 (and higher) where this transport is enabled.
- 'IMPORTANT Technical Change Announcement: Starting with version RTSDK 2.2.1.L1 (EMA/ETA
  3.8.2.L1), Enterprise Message API (EMA) C++ and Java will be extended to throw OmmInvalidUsageException
  when decoding BLANK array in either a FieldEntry or ElementEntry.'
- 'IMPORTANT Rebranding Announcement: Starting with version RTSDK 2.0.0.L1 (same as
  EMA/ETA 3.6.0.L1), there are namespace changes and library name changes.'
