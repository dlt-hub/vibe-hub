    from the UI.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://wmspanel.com/api_info:
  - Page is an optional query parameter specifying the page number, with each page
    containing up to 1000 streams. The response returns a flat array of streams without
    explicit pagination fields like next or total_count, so you increment the page
    parameter to fetch subsequent pages until no new streams are returned.
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with the page parameter. The page parameter
    is a required integer from 1 to 10000, where each page contains a number of records
    specified by the top parameter (default 20, options: 20, 50, 100, 1000). For example,
    page=2 with top=1000 skips the first 1000 records and returns records 1001-2000.
    There is no response field indicating total pages or whether more pages exist;
    pagination stops when fewer records than the top value are returned.'
