notes:
- The OpenAI REST API. Please see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference for
  more details.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in OpenAI
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ChatGPT does not do math or any other form of evaluations.
- ChatGPT often hallucinates, especially for references for research.
- Implementation uses lambdas on the backend
- More than 5 calls at the same time may take longer to respond or stop answering
- Session expired after failed identity verification attempts.
- Users are experiencing issues with the verification link.
- Severe regression in GPT-5 Codex performance — coding tasks are significantly slower
  compared to GPT-4.1.
- This forum is community-run and maintained.
- Discussions related to the ChatGPT app and plans will be hidden.
- Discussions related to the ChatGPT app and plans will be hidden, and your account
  may be suspended.
- Remove the temperature parameter from the API call for GPT-5.
- Specify the audio.input.transcription parameters to receive transcription events.
- The language and prompt parameters help improve transcription quality.
- Any call to this prompt over API instead of in the UI is producing an empty output
  array.
- Some responses may include incomplete data based on model limitations
- Player reinforcements have been used up.
- Different strategies may have different advantages and disadvantages for troop placement.
- Strategic placement of armies can influence game outcome.
- Some API responses may vary based on input parameters
- Prompts may have limitations on output size, requiring prompt chaining for larger
  requests.
- Some results didn’t have the attributes, which may indicate a bug or strange behavior.
- You can’t delete a project but you can archive it by going to manage projects on
  the project drop-down and then clicking the archive button on the corresponding
  project.
- It seems like there’s some issue with connecting Github after deleting the integration
  on the GH side.
- Pricing based on the number of characters, the time, the number of requests, or
  several of these at once.
- This forum is community-run and maintained. Not all posts are monitored.
- There is no API that provides an interface to the payment system or past usage.
- With a ChatGPT subscription you can use Codex without an API key.
- Windows support is still experimental. Currently, the best experience on Windows
  is to use Codex with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
- Sign in with a ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan for the best experience;
  an API key is also supported with extra setup.
- Setting store = false prevents output from being saved in the conversation.
- Your use of this forum means you agree to the community guidelines.
- API enforces that the JSON itself is valid, but it doesn’t automatically stop generation
  beyond that.
- 'Add a stop sequence to your request, for example stop: ["}\n"]'
- Structured output with responses API returns tons of new lines
- 'Responses API: Multiple Tool use Duplicates output_text'
- 'According to a post I’ve seen by the user moogman (I cannot send links here for
  some reason), this is a fix for the unauthorized error: Shut down vscode/cursor
  mv ~/.codex/auth.json ~/.codex/auth.json.bak Start vscode/cursor back up, and log
  back in (Select login with ChatGPT, not with API).'
- Gpt-5 calls web_search tool 10x more than before after 5th of September
- When opening the Codex sidebar, it only shows the text 'CODEX' with a blue loading
  bar.
- The login screen ('Sign in with OpenAI') never appears.
- Force Reinstall the Extension
- Related to Visual C++ Redistributable packages
- The MCP server implements the Model Context Protocol specification (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- The server acts as a proxy to Teamtailor’s public REST API
- It includes proper CORS headers and implements standard MCP methods (initialize,
  ping, tools/list, etc.)
- ChatGPT does NOT support custom tools beyond 'search' and 'fetch' for an MCP server
- search and fetch tools are required
- The team that develops or maintains the desired connector will need to make changes
  to bring it into compatibility with the expected structure
- MCP is now allowed to have custom tools in ChatGPT as long as search and fetch tools
  are present and conform to OpenAI specifications
- Tool names are snake_cased. If CamelCased tools are present in the list, ChatGPT
  will refuse to use whole MCP without any further explanation
- I’m overriding the .well-known response myself because Home Assistant’s built-in
  endpoint has bugs (e.g., it historically didn’t include the required issuer).
- "Responses API returning \t\t\n\n \t\t\n \t\t\n \t\t\n"
- 'Responses with File Search: few characters in text around citation indexes wrongly
  deleted'
- Requires coding
- Available for plus, pro, team and enterprise
- Only tools named ‘search’ and ‘retrieve’ work.
- Only the fetch tool seems to work.
- Changing the host to '0.0.0.0' fixes the server connection issue.
- MCP server is running at a valid public HTTPS URL
- The server URL is automatically redacted in the interface
- Dynamic client registration should be optional for custom connectors
- MCP spec says that dynamic client registration SHOULD be supported, but it’s not
  a MUST
- Uses OAuth2 with authorization code flow.
- PKCE is required per MCP spec
- Unable to load tools error when connecting Zapier MCP in playground
- In the Responses API, you must acquire the OAuth access token yourself and supply
  it via the headers field in your MCP tool definition. There is no built‑in redirect
  flow, so the end user cannot directly authenticate through the API.
- Downgrade openai to 1.99.9; it’s related to recent changes that will require changes
  to the agents package.
- Connection configuration is lost after refreshing the page or reopening the prompt.
- This API requires OAuth2 with a refresh token.
- Supports bearer tokens and arbitrary headers.
- Zero setup — No local server, no config files.
- The MCP tool calls consistently return None with Deep Research models.
- The server processes the requests correctly but the models receive None, suggesting
  an issue with how Deep Research models handle MCP response parsing or integration.
- Deep Research models will only ever call search and fetch functions, ignoring others
  even if applicable.
- Add stateless_http=True to your FastMCP initialization.
- Responses API only emits response.output_item.done for one server_label when multiple
  tools from different server_labels are used in a single response
- MCP servers must be secure HTTPS endpoints. HTTP is not accepted by OpenAI.
- Responses.create rewrites image URLs and returns expired SAS blobs in MCP tool call.
- Bearer token is generated using OpenSSL public/private key pairs.
- Uses BearerAuthProvider method within fastmcp.
- Pomerium acts as an identity-aware proxy to terminate TLS and enforce Zero Trust
  at the edge.
- MCP server support limited to deep research only
- Make sure the user has npx installed
- For my use case, it’s essential to pass additional parameters to the search function
  in order to prefilter results effectively.
- The search tool could support additional keyword arguments, or at the very least
  accept **kwargs to allow for more flexible integration patterns.
- The site does not have a specific way to print the topics.
- Should have been fixed/updated prior to launch
- Every time I come back to the openai docs, they are not fixed for months
- The model gpt-5-chat-latest has more differences
- API documentation may not be up-to-date.
- The o1-preview isn’t yet connected to the internet, and went into the oven some
  time ago, hence the dated knowledge cutoff.
- This API requires OAuth2 authentication.
- This API requires authentication via OAuth2.
- The action hangs when making an API call if specific knowledge files are uploaded.
- The issue may occur intermittently with different file types.
- Not all posts are monitored.
- Currently you can only process still frames, so you could split the video up into
  frames and then process them that way, but video as an input is not yet a feature.
- Some API endpoints may have usage limits
- Generating complex SQL queries (joins, aggregations, conditions, etc.)
- Constructing MongoDB queries with filters, aggregations, and nested structures
- Ensuring accuracy and optimization of the generated queries
- Potential fine-tuning or prompt engineering for better results
- The API does not have internet access and cannot install additional packages beyond
  what is pre-installed.
- When plugin feature is selected, the initial loading of the plugin list is unordered.
- However, after performing a random search in the plugin’s search box, and then reopening
  the plugin list, the plugins are displayed in alphabetical order from A to Z.
- It would be beneficial to improve the plugin dropdown list by adding a search box,
  not just within the store.
- It would be ideal for the official platform to provide a comprehensive list of all
  plugins, including descriptions and corresponding tags for each plugin.
- An update log or announcement system detailing new or modified plugins would also
  enhance usability.
- One of the few documents plugins that actually seems to work and doesn’t require
  you to make your files public.
- O3 requires org verification for Tier 5 orgs which is broken
- Uses Auth0 as primary login provider.
- Only supports text type for memory items.
- Actions may fail to trigger in the ChatGPT app.
- Persistence may lead to successful triggers after initial failures.
- Users should ensure to follow proper guidelines when dealing with sensitive information.
- Ducks are migratory animals, so this plane works best for short-to-medium distances.
- Training 200 ducks to work together might take some time.
- OpenAI has updated the document and added new IP ranges to the Plugin service IP
  list.
- Web search is not support with Batch API
- This API does not require authentication.
- Issues with API communication

  same time
- Capable to save chat histories, copy answers as well as deleting chats
- DocGPT is a cutting-edge web application that blends a PDF editor, private document
  cloud, and generative AI into one seamless platform.
- A plugin is just an API server + some prompt/spec to teach ChatGPT how to use it.
- When using Langchain, we can feed documents fetched from a vector DB to the LLM
  to generate natural language response.
- ChatGPT can submit the query to your API.
- Uses API key for authentication — requires setup of API key
- Some responses may vary depending on model version and parameters
- 32K models are not yet public, but will be Soon™.
- This is a community forum for developers building with OpenAI's APIs.
- Images aren’t great, and stories it generates may contain quite bad errors and lack
  important connections between events.
- The ChatGPT API is not available.
- ChatGPT can not be downloaded.
- One can create plugins if they have access and know how to program.
- You can download GPT-2, but not GPT-3. The latter is only accessible via the API.
- There is no 'ChatGPT API.'
- Simple and flexible. Only pay for what you use.
- There isn’t an API for ChatGPT. Well, there’s a snide one but nothing official.
- You can use your $5 credit - as long as they haven’t expired - towards any of the
  models that are unlocked for you.
- You have to pay for it based on the amount of tokens you use.
- You pay differently for the prompt and for the answer.
- You even have to pay for the prompt when the API answers with an error e.g. when
  you send more than the limitation of the model.
- There is no option to use the API for free, even for personal projects.
- OpenAI has phased out free trial API credits earlier this year. You now need to
  fund your developer account with a minimum of USD 5 in order to use the API.
- OpenAI has phased out free trial API credits earlier this year.
