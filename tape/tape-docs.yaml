auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.tapeapp.com/docs/api/introduction/:
  - The Tape API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a user API key. Credentials are
    passed via the `Authorization` header (or cURL's `-u` option for convenience).
    The base URL is `https://api.tapeapp.com` and all requests require HTTPS.
- information_source; https://developers.tapeapp.com/docs/api/resource/record/:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as the username in HTTP
    Basic Authentication format using the `-u` flag: `user_key_replace_with_your_api_key:`
    (with a colon after the key and empty password).'
  - Basic authentication using an API key. The API key is passed via HTTP Basic Auth
    in the format `api_key:` (with empty password) in the Authorization header, as
    shown in the cURL example with the `-u` flag.
  - Basic authentication using an API key. The API key is provided via HTTP Basic
    Auth in the format `api_key:` (with empty password) in the Authorization header,
    or passed as the `-u` parameter in curl requests.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key. Send your API key as the
    username in the Authorization header using the format `user_key_replace_with_your_api_key:`
    (with a colon and empty password), or use curl's `-u` flag with the same format.
    The API key should be placed before the colon in basic auth credentials.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.tapeapp.com/docs/api/resource/record/:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer, 0-500 range) to control number
    of records returned per request, and cursor (query parameter, string) to navigate
    through result sets. The response includes a total field indicating total record
    count.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (integer, 0-500 records per request) and
    cursor (string for pagination token). Use the cursor value from the response to
    request the next page; continue until no cursor is returned.
  - The response includes a cursor field that can be used for pagination. Pass the
    cursor value in subsequent requests to retrieve the next set of results. The total
    field indicates the total number of matching records found.
