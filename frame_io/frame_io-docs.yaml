auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.frame.io/api/reference/:
  - API token-based authentication is required. Tokens are passed in requests and
    must have appropriate scopes (e.g., comments.read) for the requested resource.
    Invalid or insufficiently scoped tokens return 401 or 403 errors respectively.
    All API calls are rate limited regardless of token type (Developer Token or OAuth
    App).
  - Frame.io API uses Bearer token authentication. Create a Developer Token in the
    Developer Portal and send it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <DEV_TOKEN>"
    with all requests. Invalid or missing tokens return a 401 Unauthorized error.
- information_source; https://developer.frame.io/docs:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the developer token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <DEV_TOKEN>". The token is obtained by signing into the Developer
    Portal at developer.frame.io with Frame.io credentials and creating a Developer
    Token. For OAuth2.0 applications, a separate OAuth2.0 flow is available for distribution.
- information_source; https://developer.frame.io/docs/device-integrations/implementing-c2c-authentication-and-authorization:
  - 'Frame.io uses OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow for authentication. In
    Step 2, make a POST request to https://api.frame.io/v2/auth/token with form parameters:
    client_id (from Step 1), device_code (returned previously), and grant_type set
    to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code. Poll this endpoint until the
    user completes authorization; expect authorization_pending errors during polling
    and expired_token if the code expires before user entry.'
  - Frame.io uses OAuth2 device flow authentication. Request a device code via POST
    to `/v2/auth/device/code` with form data (not JSON) containing client_id, client_secret,
    and scope parameters. For URL code pairing, include headers x-client-version and
    x-client-platypus-enabled set to true. The scope parameter should include required
    permissions like asset_create and offline.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.frame.io/docs/getting-started/key-concepts:
  - Pagination for resource collections is supported but specific parameters and response
    fields are not detailed in this section. Additional documentation would be needed
    to determine exact pagination mechanisms such as query parameters (page, limit,
    offset, cursor) and response fields (next, has_more, total_count).
