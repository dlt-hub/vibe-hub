notes:
- It is important to be aware that the capabilities that are enabled via the Hinting
  API are not dynamic - for example, the Tracking Service will not automatically detect
  that a user is holding an object.
- If there is a conflict between hints, the order in which the hints has been provided
  will be treated by the Tracking Service as an indication of priority.
- The Tracking Service makes no guarantee to the application that it will follow any
  particular behaviour, so developers should choose hints for their intention.
- Not all hints work the same across all platforms. The service will attempt to pick
  the best hand tracking to meet a client application’s described use-case.
- Some hints values will only be supported when the hand tracking service has a Hyperion
  license.
- Over time supported hints will be added and removed.
- 'Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_LOW_RESOURCE_USAGE for Low Power Mode'
- 'Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_HIGH_HAND_FIDELITY for High Performance Mode'
- 'Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_USER_INPUT for UI Input Mode'
- 'Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_HIGH_BACKGROUND_ILLUMINATION for Light Robustness
  Mode'
- 'Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_FAST_HAND_MOTION for Fast Hands Mode'
- The code assumes the video stream has a specific format where the last line of each
  frame encodes metadata.
- OpenCV can provide image access and has been tested on Windows and Linux - however,
  there may be problems with this code on MacOS.
- Marker Tracking requires Version 6.0 of the Ultraleap Tracking Service or later.
- Enabling marker tracking will significantly increase CPU usage of the Ultraleap
  Tracking service.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Supports saving your interaction designs, storing parameter values in a JSON file
  format.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Make sure there are minimal infrared (IR) sources and reflections in the camera’s
  field-of-view.
- Digital screens can act as mirrors, creating IR glare from the camera module’s own
  LEDs.
- Operating your Ultraleap camera in bright sunlight may also impact performance.
- Make sure that UI elements are within the field of view.
- Minimal infrared (IR) sources and reflections in the camera’s field-of-view can
  reduce the quality of hand tracking.
- Operating your Ultraleap camera in bright sunlight may impact performance.
- In some kiosk scenarios, the default file location for the Configuration Files may
  be inaccessible due to permissions.
- If you select an alternate location, TouchFree Service may not be able to read or
  edit the config files unless it is launched in Administrator mode.
- Changing the port and/or IP will require a manual restart of the TouchFree service
  for the changes to take effect.
- In most cases these settings should not be changed.
- AirPush is the default mode for most touchless kiosks and screen-based experiences.
- Recommended interaction zone of around 5cm for hybrid setups.
- The TouchFree Tooling Bundle contains the bundled tooling source file.
- The quickest way to try TouchFree Tooling is using the quick start example.
- You do not need an Ultraleap Hand Tracking Camera to use the Camera Position Visualizer.
- Uses AirPush with Scroll & Drag enabled to avoid interference with touchscreen users
- Recommended interaction zone of around 5cm for hybrid setups
- If another website is opened, or the browser containing the Ultraleap Camera Position
  Visualizer is closed, the settings will reset to the defaults. Any images loaded
  during a browser session will not be stored.
- Gesture interactions are based on insights from previous projects.
- The hand tracking camera must be mounted for optimal gesture recognition.
- The interactions outlined in this document have been designed and developed in line
  with user-centred design principles but have not been validated against relevant
  industry standards and guidelines.
- You don’t necessarily need to create a 3D world to use hand tracking in traditional
  displays
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Recommendations based on the accessibility problems experienced by users.
- Contains a small puzzle spoiler for “I Expect You To Die 2“
- Check out the Unity code for some of these explorations in our experiments repository
- XR Keyboard is licensed under Apache 2.0
- XR Keyboard is not actively maintained or managed, and provided as is.
- Uses Ultraleap hand tracking for interaction.
- You can import customized hand models and have them work with our world-leading
  hand tracking.
- You can iterate between whatever modelling package you’re using (for example Autodesk
  Maya or Blender) and the live hand models in Unity.
- Setup requires Ultraleap Hand Tracking Software and OpenXR runtime
- Ensure Active Input Handling is set to Both in Project Settings
- Ultraleap uses OpenUPM for easy installation of Unity packages.
- Ensure that frequently accessed objects and UI panels are positioned within easy
  reach and in clear view by default.
- Ultraleap recommend communicating tracking loss to users by changing the visual
  representation of the hands.
- Direct interaction requires users to be up close to interactive elements.
- Distant interaction allows users to reach far more from a stationery position.
- Ultraleap recommends a qwerty keyboard for short form text entry.
- Accented characters should appear on a long-press of a key.
- This is the recommended way of setting any configurations, as this file is parsed
  every time an application using our layer is started.
- If you’re making use of both the configuration file and environment variables then
  environment variables override their configuration file counterpart.
- JSON can be picky with its syntax and prone to mistakes, it’s always good practice
  to run your file through a JSON validator to ensure it is error-free.
- Keys should be 4cm x 4cm with a 0.5cm gap between each key.
- Configuration file is the recommended way of setting configurations.
- Environment variables override configuration file settings.
- First frame of data might have erroneous joint positions when the hand is initialised
  at a high velocity.
- LeapC acts as the intermediary between your application and the Hand Tracking Service.
- Ultraleap TouchFree for BrightSign will not currently function correctly if either
  WD-103 or WD-104 BrightSign WiFi modules are installed inside the media player.
- The mains power adapter is not connected.
- BrightOS 8.5.31 or later is installed on an XT4 series box.
- The Leap Motion Controller is not supported.
- Videos need to be 1080x1920 resolution (portrait 1080p).
- Ensure to toggle on the Interactive toggle in BrightAuthor.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Leap API
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) on x86_64 / amd64 processors
- Packages can be uninstalled with `sudo apt remove ultraleap-hand-tracking && sudo
  apt autoremove`.
- LeapC provides tracking data as simple structs without any convenience functions.
- No authentication required for accessing the TouchFree Tooling.
- If you are prompted to accept the EULA, you may need to press Tab then Enter to
  accept.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Hands may experience jitter when the head position is rapidly changed on SteamVR
  & Monado on Linux.
