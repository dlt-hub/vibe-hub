  for development work.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- File activity is any change made to a file, comment, or assignment by a user.
- Heretto CCMS tracks all the activity for each file in the Activity interface.
- Each package segments your content differently.
- Avoid uploading very large packages (500 MB or more).
- Heretto Portal and Heretto Deploy API are separate products
- Editing files through Oxygen makes it impossible for multiple authors and contributors
  to collaborate in one file simultaneously.
- Heretto CCMS is a web application that runs using most laptop or desktop computers.
- Heretto CCMS is not designed or optimized for use on mobile devices or tablets.
- Content Mapper Integration is only compatible with Windows operating systems.
- The endpoint URL structure has changed from v3 to v4.
- Manual deploy is available for all portal environments.

  publishing scenarios.
- PDF Generator publishing jobs have a maximum running time of ten (10) minutes, after
  which they time out.
- The Prince formatter has a limitation that prevents it from processing SVG files
  larger than 10 MB.
- The code editor continuously validates your code.
- Invalid code is underlined and also indicated in the scrollbar.
- 'Last updated: November 6, 2025'
- Publishing annotated images is not supported by the DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT)
  publishing engine. It is supported by PDF Generator.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'If you save your scenario to a location that is different than the original scenario
  location, when publishing with the duplicated scenario, you may get this error:
  `Error - Failed - unable to process: 500 Internal Server Error from POST https://workers.easydita.com/cms/v1/all-files/6ebe20b0-55ce-11eb-a796-02428d90e38c/download-as-bundle-for-pdfgen`.
  If you do, you need to make a simple change in the scenario to fix that.'
- PDF handling supports publishing PDFs hosted only in Heretto CCMS.
- PDF files published to portal are not indexed or returned in search results.
- When using the Next and Previous buttons in portal to navigate between pages, PDF
  files are skipped.
- In portal output, clicking the link opens the PDF file in a new tab.
- Automatic redirects are supported only in manual deployments. They aren't supported
  in active sync deployments.
- Ensure your content is easy to browse on mobile devices.
- Create unique content that provides your readers with proper solutions.
- OAuth is not recommended; OpenID Connect is the preferred method.
- If you add a file to the deployment with a lower version, or a Swagger file, it
  will be upgraded to OpenAPI version 3.0.1.
- Under maintenance
- OAuth is not recommended, OpenID Connect is recommended.
- Using the Google OIDC example, the JWT endpoint will provide a plain JSON object.
- Using the JWT decoding step is not recommended for production environments.
- Replace portal-sub-domain-name with your customer portal sub-domain name.
- Only users with authoring permissions can edit using the Source Editor.
- If multiple users collaborate on a resource, Heretto CCMS places a collaboration
  lock on the topic and the XML code is not editable.
- Heretto CCMS is compatible with Chrome and Firefox.
- If you enter an incorrect username or password five times in a row, you will be
  locked out for 30 minutes.
- Valid characters for file and folder names are lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase
  letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-), and period (.)
- Elements are context-sensitive.
- If your image is too large, set the width for the image.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Heretto

  Content Editor.
- Heretto CCMS automatically saves a document any time there is a change to the file.
- Any user with publishing permissions can use DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) publishing
  scenarios.
- Only users with the Administrator role in Heretto CCMS can create publishing scenarios.
- Heretto CCMS has the Preflight Check validation mechanism built into the publishing
  interface that automatically performs content checks.
- We recommend resolving any issues identified by the Preflight Check before publishing
  your content.
- When publishing, users assigned the Administrator role can also select the Debug
  publish option that generates additional files in the debug folder of the output
  ZIP file.
- Users with the Administrator role in Heretto CCMS can edit publishing scenarios.
- Automatic redirects are supported only in manual deployments and are enabled by
  default for each manual deployment.
- Automatic redirects are maintained for 18 months since its publication to portal.
- Automatic redirects are not supported in active sync deployments.
- Heretto Portal uses an automatic heading generation system.
- Currently both resourceId and resource_id are supported. However, resource_id is
  deprecated and will eventually be discontinued. We recommend using only resourceId.
- Manual Redirects are supported in both active sync and manual deployments.
- Automatic redirects require the id attribute to be set manually for the sitesection,
  topichead, and version elements in sitemaps.
- Avoid using negative values for margin and padding properties.
- Avoid using percent values. Try using flex or flex-basis properties.
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatting rules apply.
- CSS classes of rendered DITA elements remain the same both in Heretto Portal and
  Heretto PDF Generator.
- By default, when you upload a ZIP archive to the Content Library, Heretto CCMS unzips
  the archive retaining its folder structure.
- If you selected any ZIP files that you do not want to be automatically unzipped,
  clear the corresponding Unzip check box.
- Maintaining multiple config.json files in a single sitemap enables you to easily
  manage your preview, staging, and production portal configurations.
- Do not upload empty files into Heretto CCMS.
- Ensure you have the permissions to edit the main config.json file associated with
  your main portal sitemap.
- Contact your Customer Success Manager to set up your domain.
- The Heretto CCMS API (v2) enables programmatic access to publishing and deployment
  operations within the Heretto Component Content Management System (CCMS).
- The Heretto CCMS API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object
  per request.
- Responses include metadata such as totalPages, totalElements, and numberOfElements
  to help you implement pagination controls.
- Simple API Keys grant access to every client and should not be used from the browser.
- Never expose your secret keys in client-side code or third-party web tools.
- Users assigned the Administrator role can create and delete API keys.
- The next generation Heretto Deploy API (v4) is being rolled out to customers.
- Customer rollout of manual deploy v4 is performed entirely by the Heretto team.
