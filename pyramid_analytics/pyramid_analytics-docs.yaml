  : - All API actions in Pyramid require an authorization token passed in the request
      to ensure the right user can perform the right action. The token is sent via
      POST requests with JSON data objects, allowing a simpler and more direct method
      of authorizing each method call compared to GET-based approaches.

  : - 'Authenticate User (JavaScript):


      The API uses token-based authentication. First, call the "authentication/authenticateUser"
      endpoint with userName and password in the request body to obtain a token. Then,
      include this token in subsequent API calls (passed as the third parameter to
      callApi, typically in the Authorization header) to authenticate requests.'
    - Authenticate User method requires a UserCredentials object containing user login
      information sent via POST to /API3/authentication/authenticateUser. The response
      is a security token (base64 string) that must be embedded in every subsequent
      API call for authorization, typically stored as a cookie.
    - The security token is a string that must be included in every API call for authorization.
      It can be obtained by calling the authenticateUser endpoint with username and
      password credentials, or by calling authenticateUserByToken with a userName
      and existing token. The token can be stored as a cookie in a web browser to
      enable auto-login for authenticated users. The token should be embedded in API
      requests as needed (typically in request headers or parameters depending on
      the specific endpoint).

  : - Administrative users must authenticate by supplying username and password to
      a REST authentication method, which returns a token string. This token must
      be stored and appended to the JSON request payload for each subsequent API method
      call. Embed logins follow the same pattern but save the resulting token as a
      browser cookie. Windows Authentication logins are also available for SSO scenarios
      using the currently logged-in user's credentials.
