notes:
- Requires permission 'Financial Account Read'.
- Pagination uses nextPage links for cursor-based iteration

- Pagination parameters include pageNumber and pageSize, indicating support for page-based
  navigation.
- Only fields containing values are present in the response.
- Pagination allows 1-100 entries per page.
- If no entries are found, a 400 Bad Request response is returned.

  otherwise; maximum storage duration is 168 hours
- Validation errors occur if tier indices are skipped or toQuantity is not properly
  set
- Deleting entities on a product that have been deleted cannot be recovered; updates
  cannot be undone
- Webhooks provide real-time updates, alternative to scheduled API polling
- Webhook attempts are retried every 3 hours up to 10 times before manual intervention
  is needed
