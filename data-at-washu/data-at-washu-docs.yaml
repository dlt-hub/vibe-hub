notes:
- JWT is only valid for 1 hour
- The data warehouse is a centralized repository of data.
- Legacy data refers to FIS and HRMS data prior to the Workday go-live date.
- Power BI can be connected to the WashU data warehouse to produce dashboards, insights
  and reports.
- All users of Power BI and other data tools should be aware of appropriate use of
  data.
- The recommended browser for Cognos is Chrome.
- Mozilla Firefox is discouraged due to performance issues.
- If you experience a data mismatch, it may be due to a pending data refresh.
- Uses OAuth2 for access — requires WUSTL key for authentication
- Recommended browser for Cognos is Chrome
- WashU employees can log in with a WUSTL Key and SSO to access Collibra.
- A DSA is executed through the DocuSign application.
- The DSA on this page is applicable to research administration data.
- The DG Team continues to make great progress on the roadmap for onboarding and training
  new data domains & functional areas.
- 'A couple of key highlights: Supporting 20+ functional areas are actively working
  on metadata management goals.'
- This policy establishes a governance framework designed to promote and safeguard
  the appropriate and effective use of Institutional Data.
- Data Users include all employees, faculty, staff, students, contractors, volunteers,
  trustees and affiliates.
- While the Course Section Definition and Program of Study Definition datasets provide
  foundational registration data, they do not include details about individual students
  or their specific programs of study. These details and additional student attributes
  will be included in the second phase of the project launching this summer.
- Project updates are available for each phase.
- Training efforts are ongoing for users of the WashU Data Warehouse.
- Access to Workday Student Data also includes access to Waitlist Utilization data.
- Contact the Data Team for access to data.
- Data is updated monthly from various source systems.
- Some reports may have limited access based on user roles.
- Users will be required to sign into Cognos with their WUSTLKey Email (including
  the ‘@wustl.edu’), rather than their WUSTLKey username.
- Access directly to the data means that I was able to output reports that are more
  accurate and more meaningful for my people than the canned reporting coming out
  of DestinyOne.
- Communication emerged as a cornerstone of success during the project.
- Report Authors will need to include at least one Position data element in the report
  or there will be duplicate rows.
- This report does not currently include research activities that are not captured
  in RMS such as clinical trials, in-kind support, or research sponsored outside of
  the university.
- Always use the dollars from Award Budget Line Measures for official reporting.
- Grants with a Lifecycle Status = ‘Error’ should be excluded.
- You must include either Test or Prod in the naming convention.
- It’s advised that you also have a Prod account.
- Workday is the source of truth and provides the data for the WashU APIs.
- Integrators with integration needs can request new integrations and/or changes/enhancements
  to existing integrations.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Make sure the Anypoint Exchange process has been completed first.
- SSL certificate verification = Off
- Request timeout in ms = 0
- Max response size in MB = 0
- JWT’s expire after 1 hour.
- You can reuse the JWT to access other API’s.
- The API returns current state transactional data only, historical and future dated
  information is not returned.
