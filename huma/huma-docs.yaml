  - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with authorization URL "https://example.com/oauth/authorize"
    and token URL "https://example.com/oauth/token", requiring scopes "scope1" and
    "scope2". Alternatively, HTTP Bearer authentication with JWT format can be used,
    sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>".
  - 'OAuth 2.0 is used for authorization to verify incoming requests. The documentation
    outlines three main implementation pieces: issuing access tokens, documenting
    the auth scheme in OpenAPI, and authorizing incoming requests through API Gateway
    auth, Huma auth middleware, or supporting different token formats. JWT tokens
    are supported, and optional client auto-configuration is available.'
  - OAuth 2.0 is used to authorize incoming API requests. Access tokens (typically
    JWTs) are issued by a third-party service or custom signing authority and must
    be configured in the OpenAPI SecuritySchemes component. The implementation requires
    defining OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g. Authorization Code, Client Credentials) with authorization
    and token URLs, and specifying required scopes for API endpoints.
