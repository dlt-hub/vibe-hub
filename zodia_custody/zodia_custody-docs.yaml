auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.zodia.io/zodia-custody-api-doc.html:
  - Notification payloads are encrypted and signed using secured cryptographic algorithms.
    For REST API webhooks, clients must provide an API callback URL (HTTPS endpoint),
    authentication details (which may include OAuth with token URL, client ID, and
    client secret if applicable), and specify POST as the method. For JMS webhooks,
    clients provide JMS broker URL, security principal, destination topic name, JNDI
    name, SSL enablement status with certificate if needed, and broker login password.
  - Request signing using company private key. The payload must exactly match the
    JSON string used for signature generation, including spaces and newlines. Use
    the full encoded API path in a colon-separated string format for signing. Ensure
    you are using the correct company private key.
  - The API requires a `submitter-id` header containing the email of the API user
    submitting the request (e.g., api-maker@zodia.io). This header is required for
    all requests to identify the authenticated user making the API call.
  - The API requires a submitter-id header containing the email address of the API
    user submitting the request (e.g., api-maker@zodia.io). This appears to be the
    authentication mechanism for identifying the requester.
  - 'The API requires a submitter-id header containing the email address of the API
    user submitting the request. For example, submitter-id: api-maker@zodia.io. This
    appears to be a user identification mechanism rather than a traditional authentication
    credential.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.zodia.io/zodia-custody-api-doc.html:
  - Pagination uses offset-limit scheme with paginationLimit and paginationOffset
    parameters in the request body. Response includes total field indicating total
    count and items array containing paginated results. Stop paginating when items
    returned is less than paginationLimit or when offset exceeds total.
  - Pagination uses paginationLimit (default 10, number of items in response) and
    paginationOffset (offset position) as request body parameters to control which
    items are returned.
  - Pagination uses paginationLimit (number of items in response, default 10) and
    paginationOffset (numeric offset) parameters in the request body. The response
    includes a total field indicating the total count of results.
  - Pagination uses paginationLimit (number of items in response, default 10) and
    paginationOffset (offset position) as request body parameters to control which
    items are returned in the audit trail response.
  - Pagination uses paginationLimit (number of items in response, default 10) and
    paginationOffset (offset value) parameters in the request body to control page
    size and position. The response structure for indicating total count or next page
    information is not documented.
