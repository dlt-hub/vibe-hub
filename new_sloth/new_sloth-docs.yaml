auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.newsloth.com/api-reference:
  - Authentication to the API uses HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the username
    and API secret as the password, Base64 encoded in the Authorization header as
    'username:password'. Your API key and secret are found in your account profile
    after signing up for an API-enabled plan.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: HTTP Basic Auth and Bearer Auth.
    For Basic Auth, set the Authorization header to "Basic " followed by a Base64-encoded
    string of "API_key:Secret", or use curl''s -u flag with API_key:Secret. For Bearer
    Auth, set the Authorization header to "Bearer " followed by a Base64-encoded string
    of "API_key:Secret". All requests require HTTPS and must include valid credentials;
    requests without authentication or with invalid credentials will fail with a 401
    Unauthorized response.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key and secret. Include credentials
    in the request using the `-u [API_key]:[Secret]` format, which translates to the
    Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials in the format `Authorization:
    Basic base64(API_key:Secret)`.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key and secret. Send credentials
    as `-u [API_key]:[Secret]` in the request, which translates to an Authorization
    header with Base64-encoded "API_key:Secret" in the format `Authorization: Basic
    base64(API_key:Secret)`.'
