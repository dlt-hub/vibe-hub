notes:
- Workspace Administrators, Solution Managers, and Solution Creators can create, edit
  and delete the SmartDoc Field
- API limits help ensure platform performance for all users
- Prevent abuse or accidental overload
- A best practice is to create an API Member account that has only those permissions
  necessary to perform the actions required for your integration.
- Treat your API key as sensitive information. Exposure can grant unauthorized access
  to your SmartSuite data.
- SmartSuite sets limits on API usage based on monthly request limits.
- If you exceed the plan limit, your access is throttled and eventually paused.
- SmartSuite allows API usage up to 125% of your plan’s monthly limit.
- Exceeding the rate cap results in a 429 Too Many Requests error with a 30-second
  retry delay.
- Auto-billing for overages is not available on the Free plan.
- SmartSuite may add new keys to response objects without notice, but existing keys
  will not be removed without prior deprecation warnings.
- Authenticate requests using HTTPS.
- Your Workspace ID is the 8-character identifier in your SmartSuite URL after logging
  in.
- Use a dedicated workspace account for Zapier automations with minimal permissions.
- Ensure this account has access only to the tables and data necessary for your workflows.
- 'Activity history retention varies by plan: Free Forever Plan - 14 days, Team Plan
  - 6 months, Professional Plan - 18 months, Enterprise Plan - 3 years.'
- Admins must provide an OpenAI API key for extended use.
- The Table of Contents is not configurable and will display text exactly as it appears
  in the headings.
- Tables are particularly good for displaying more structured or categorized data.
- The default table is configured as a Header Row.
- 'Retrieve Multiple Matches: Records meeting the criteria are returned as Line Items.'
- If multiple records match, the action will return the first matching record only.
- API Key access is limited to individual user accounts.
- Treat your API Key like a password. Do not share it with others.
- SmartSuite may add keys to response objects without warning, but existing keys will
  not be removed without a deprecation notice.
- Prefill prefix is case sensitive.
- Hidden fields can be prefilled without exposing sensitive information.
- This table helps ensure accurate API interactions when specifying country-related
  field values.
- SmartDoc fields aren't just for text; you can add a wide variety of multimedia content.
- If you drag an image file (e.g., .GIF, .PNG, .JPG), it will display as an image.
- 'Standard Usage: 5 requests per second, per user.'
- 'Overage Limit: When exceeding your API request allowance, the limit drops to 2
  requests per second, per user.'
- 'Hard Limit: Requests exceeding 125% of the monthly limit will be denied until the
  next month.'
- Changes may take up to 5 minutes to take effect.
- Users must still be invited by a SmartSuite administrator before they will be able
  to log in with SSO.
- Callouts can improve your document’s readability and clarity.
- Treat your API key as a password—do not share it with others.
- Regularly review and regenerate API keys to maintain security.
- Hydration is available for field types like Single Select, Multiple Select, Status,
  First Created, Last Updated, Assigned To, Tags, Vote, Time Tracking Log, Checklist,
  Lookup.
- Skyvia Backup is not currently supported for SmartSuite.
