  configuration.
- bun install supports workspaces similarly to npm, with more features
- Unlike other npm clients, Bun does not execute arbitrary lifecycle scripts for installed
  dependencies, such as `postinstall` and `node-gyp` builds.
- This only allows lifecycle scripts for the specific package listed in `trustedDependencies`,
  *not* the dependencies of that dependency!
- bun install supports workspaces similarly to npm, with more features.
- Use 'bun pm ls' to list installed packages.
- Use 'bun pm pack' to create a package tarball.

- Recommended to use bunfig.toml for enhanced flexibility
- Argument vector is available as Bun.argv.
- To parse argv into a more useful format, util.parseArgs can be used.
- Uses Bun.spawn() to spawn a child process
- This API is only compatible with other `bun` processes.
- The Bun.file() function accepts a path and returns a BunFile instance.
- When using Bun.spawn(), the stdout of the child process can be consumed as a ReadableStream
  via proc.stdout.
- To instead pipe the stdout of the child process to stdout of the parent process,
  set 'inherit'.
- This API is only compatible with other bun processes.
- All messages are serialized using the JSC serialize API.
- Uses fs.watch for listening to file system changes
- Delete a directory and all its contents using rm from node:fs/promises
- The `Bun.file()` function accepts a path and returns a `BunFile` instance.
- The `BunFile` class extends `Blob` and allows you to lazily read the file in a variety
  of formats.
- The BunFile class extends Blob and allows you to lazily read the file in a variety

- To print all currently-set environment variables to the command line, run `bun --print
  process.env`. This is useful for debugging.
- Build-time constants are embedded directly into your compiled code, making them
  zero runtime overhead, immutable, optimizable, and secure.
- Build-time constants are embedded directly into your compiled code, making them
  immutable and secure.
- Zero runtime overhead - No environment variable lookups or file reads
- Immutable - Values are baked into the binary at compile time
- Optimizable - Dead code elimination can remove unused branches
- Secure - No external dependencies or configuration files to manage
- This is especially useful for embedding metadata like build versions, timestamps,
  or configuration flags directly into your compiled executables.
- Build-time constants are embedded directly into your compiled code
- Values must be valid JSON that will be parsed and inlined as JavaScript expressions
- VSCode extension support is currently buggy.
- We recommend the Web Debugger for now.
- Bun implements V8's heap snapshot API, which allows you to create snapshots of the
  heap at runtime.
- The `--define` flag lets you declare statically-analyzable constants and globals.
- This feature is supported at runtime and also in `bun build`.
- Uses build-time constants with --define

- You will need to create a preload script for Happy DOM and for Testing Library.
- If you are using TypeScript, you will also need to make use of declaration merging.
- Uses Jest-style snapshot testing via .toMatchSnapshot()
- Bun internally re-writes imports from `@jest/globals` to use the `bun:test` equivalents.
- 'If you''re using `testEnvironment: "jsdom"` to run your tests in a browser-like
  environment, you should follow the [DOM testing with Bun and happy-dom](/guides/test/happy-dom)
  guide to inject browser APIs into the global scope.'
- Bun has a built-in test runner with a Jest-like expect API.
- Tests can be filtered by name using the -t/--test-name-pattern flag.
- Bun's test runner supports setting the system time programmatically with the setSystemTime
  function.
- To reset the system clock to the actual time, call setSystemTime with no arguments.
- The test runner will recursively search for all files in the directory that match
  specific patterns.
- Make sure the registration file is executed before test files.
- Uses Happy DOM to mock browser APIs
- Ensure the preload file is executed before tests
- The default timeout is 5000 (5 seconds).
- Uses the `--rerun-each` flag to re-run every test multiple times.
- Bun's test runner supports built-in code coverage reporting via the --coverage flag.
- To set a minimum coverage threshold, add the following line to your bunfig.toml.
  This requires that 90% of your codebase is covered by tests.
- Uses the `--coverage` flag to enable code coverage reporting.
- Uses built-in code coverage reporting
- To set a minimum coverage threshold, add the following line to your bunfig.toml.
- This requires that 90% of your codebase is covered by tests.
- If your test suite does not meet this threshold, bun test will exit with a non-zero
  exit code to signal a failure.
- Different thresholds can be set for line-level and function-level coverage.
- Uses GlobalRegistrator to register and unregister before and after each test
- Bun's test runner supports built-in code coverage reporting.
- Uses Argon2id algorithm by default for password hashing
- Uses Bun for testing with Svelte components
- Uses Argon2id algorithm by default for password hashing.
- The `Bun.sleep` method provides a convenient way to create a void `Promise` that
  resolves in a fixed number of milliseconds.
- 'Handles incoming ws: or wss: requests for WebSocket connections'
- Provides a native pub-sub API.
- Sockets can be subscribed to a set of named channels.
- Contextual data is set when the connection is initially upgraded by passing a data
  parameter in the server.upgrade() call
- Common to read cookies/headers from the incoming request to identify the connecting
  client
- Uses Bun.write() API to efficiently write data to disk.
- Any relative paths will be resolved relative to the project root.
- The `FileSink` will also auto-flush when its internal buffer is full.
- You can configure the buffer size with the `highWaterMark` option.
- Bun now supports MySQL and SQLite, alongside PostgreSQL.
- Native YAML support added.
- Bun is stable and ready for production.
- Bun now supports compiling and running C from JavaScript to make using systems libraries
  easier.
- Bun supports TypeScript and JSX out of the box.
- When using `bun run`, put Bun flags like `--watch` immediately after `bun`.
- Uses Bun's fast startup times
- The Zig compiler is automatically installed and updated by the build scripts. Manual
  installation is not required.
- Ubuntu distributions (<= 20.04) may require installation of the C++ standard library
  independently.
- If the above command fails with `Unable to locate package gcc-11`, we need to add
  the APT repository
- Bun executes the script command in a subshell.
- Native installation requires curl command to download and install Bun.
- To fix the error, we need to update the GCC version to 11.
- If the command fails with `Unable to locate package gcc-11`, we need to add the
  APT repository.
- Uses Bun's runtime for executing package executables.
- Bun requires LLVM 19 (clang is part of LLVM).
- If the above command fails with `Unable to locate package gcc-11` we need to add
  the APT repository
- The issue may manifest when initially running `bun setup` as Clang being unable
  to compile a simple program
- 'If you see an error on macOS when compiling `libarchive`, run: brew install pkg-config'
- 'If you see this error when compiling, run: xcode-select --install'
- Bun defaults to linking `libatomic` statically, as not all systems have it.
- The built version of Bun may not work on other systems if compiled this way.
- If you run into issues with `ccache` when building TinyCC, try reinstalling ccache
- Experimental API
- To start the server, see serve
- In development mode, `Bun.serve()` returns rendered error messages with stack traces
  instead of a generic 500 error.
- This API inherently has some rough edges
- It does not support empty files. It will throw a SystemError with EINVAL
- Usage on shared/networked filesystems is discouraged. It will be very slow.
- If you delete or truncate the file, that will crash bun. This is called a segmentation
  fault.
- You will need OpenSSL 3 or later
- Uses Bun as a JavaScript runtime environment
- Uses perfect forward secrecy on client connections
- Returns an empty object when the key exchange is not ephemeral
- Bundles JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML and other supported files into optimized
  outputs.
- Fast incremental writer for files and pipes.
- Optionally override the trusted CA certificates. Default is to trust the well-known
  CAs curated by Mozilla. Mozilla's CAs are completely replaced when CAs are explicitly
  specified using this option.
- Cert chains in PEM format. One cert chain should be provided per private key. Each
  cert chain should consist of the PEM formatted certificate for a provided private
  key, followed by the PEM formatted intermediate certificates (if any), in order,
  and not including the root CA (the root CA must be pre-known to the peer, see ca).
  When providing multiple cert chains, they do not have to be in the same order as
  their private keys in key. If the intermediate certificates are not provided, the
  peer will not be able to validate the certificate, and the handshake will fail.
- Must be between `-1` and `9` for compression level.
- The default compression level is `6`.
- Uses non-blocking APIs by default
- Decompresses a chunk of data with `zlib` GUNZIP algorithm.
- Supports JSX
