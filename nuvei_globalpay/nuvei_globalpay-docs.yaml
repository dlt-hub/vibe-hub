auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs-apm.nuvei.com/:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used for all API requests. Credentials consist of
    a secret API Key sent via HTTP Basic Auth. All requests must use HTTPS protocol.
    The API Key must be kept secret and regenerated immediately if compromised. Separate
    API Keys are provided for Test and Live environments.

  - 'HTTP Basic Auth is required for REST API access. The username is the SiteID and
    the password is the API Key, both generated upon Integration site creation. Concatenate
    SiteID and API Key with a colon separator, Base64 encode the result, and send
    it in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic {Base64-encoded-string}".
    Example: for SiteID "30201" and API Key "+9KeGzKF7W8S/79a5R33YJUg7E7WFNcZbjGfzLV3bXSnFCOyFt",
    the header becomes "Authorization: Basic MzAyMDE6KzlLZUd6S0Y3VzhTLzc5YTVSMzNZSlVnN0U3V0ZOY1piakdmekxWM2JYU25GQ095RnQ=".
