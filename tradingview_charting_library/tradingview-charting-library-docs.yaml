notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with JWT for server-to-server authentication
- Requires separate credentials for production API
- 'Broker should provide at least two independent sets of credentials to its production
  API: one for clients in the TradingView production, one for clients in staging,
  testing and development.'
- 'If the number of simultaneous connections is limited to one connection per account,
  the broker needs to provide the required number of credentials sets: two for client
  applications in the staging, two for client applications in the production, two
  for development and testing.'
- OAuth 2 Code Flow is supported.
- The authorization process takes place in a separate tab. It will close in **240
  seconds** after opening, even if no access token has been received.
- TradingView mobile applications use embedded webview where the TradingView application
  theme color is used.
- Regular endpoints are supported for 1 month after switching to the streaming endpoints.
- Handling the requests from both types of endpoints will secure an uninterrupted
  integration operability.
- Demo storage is provided 'as is', and its stability is not guaranteed.
- The data within the storage is regularly deleted.
- Groups cannot be deleted, you can only remove all the symbols from there.
- Each integration is limited to have up to 10 symbol groups.
- Each symbol group is limited to have up to 10K symbols in it.
- real-time data obtained from the API streaming endpoint must match the historical
  data, obtained from the /history API.
- Server constantly keeps the connection alive. If the connection is broken - the
  server constantly tries to restore it.
- The broker must remove unnecessary restrictions (firewall, rate limits, etc.) for
  the set of IP addresses of our servers.
- StreamingHeartbeatResponse is a technical message that prevents the feed from unsubscribing
  from streaming.
- When configuring webhooks, ensure that you don't include sensitive information such
  as login credentials or passwords in the webhook body.
- Webhook alerts are only allowed when 2-factor authentication is enabled.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- Requests to other ports will be rejected.
- If a remote server takes longer than three seconds to process a request, the request
  will be cancelled.
- IPv6 isn't currently supported for webhooks.
