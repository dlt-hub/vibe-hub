auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/query-optimizer/stats-api:
  - Basic authentication using username and password credentials. The curl example
    shows `--user tigergraph:tigergraph` which sends credentials as HTTP Basic Auth
    in the Authorization header.
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/rest-api/authentication:
  - 'TigerGraph Savanna REST APIs require authentication using API keys. Include the
    API key in the request header as `x-api-key: <your-api-key>`.'
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/:
  - For requests sent to the GSQL server, TigerGraph user credentials must be provided.
    The documentation indicates that credentials are required but does not specify
    the exact authentication mechanism, header names, parameter names, or how credentials
    should be formatted in the request.
  - 'User credentials can be provided via four methods: curl `-u <user:password>`
    option, JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <JWT-token>` header (graph-specific
    access), Basic auth in `Authorization: Basic <encoded-username-password>` header,
    or GSQL secret in `Authorization: GSQL-Secret <gsql-secret>` header. If authentication
    is enabled on the RESTPP server, a request token must be included in the request
    header.'
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/authentication:
  - 'Authorization tokens are required for REST++ endpoints and should be included
    in the HTTP Authorization header as a Bearer token. Use the header format "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" where the token is obtained through initial authentication and
    expires after a default period of 1 month. Additionally, 3rd party JWT tokens
    are supported. For GSQL Server requests, use HTTP Basic Authentication with the
    curl -u option in the format username:password, or alternatively use a .netrc
    file to avoid exposing credentials on the command line.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/built-in-endpoints:
  - limit is an optional query parameter that accepts an integer value to specify
    the maximum number of edges returned per request. The response does not include
    pagination fields like next or has_more, suggesting this endpoint returns all
    matching results up to the limit without cursor-based or page-based navigation.
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/gsql-endpoints:
  - The documentation shows SCIM pagination with query parameters startIndex (starting
    position) and itemsPerPage (results per page), and response fields totalResults
    (total count), startIndex (current position), and itemsPerPage (page size). Stop
    pagination when the number of returned resources is less than itemsPerPage or
    when startIndex plus itemsPerPage exceeds totalResults.
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: totalResults (total count), startIndex
    (starting position, default 1), and itemsPerPage (items per page, default 100).
    Use startIndex and itemsPerPage as query parameters to paginate through results;
    continue requesting with incremented startIndex values until all results are retrieved
    based on totalResults.'
- information_source; https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/api/gsql-endpoints:
  - 'The documentation shows pagination response fields: totalResults, startIndex,
    itemsPerPage. Request parameters for pagination are not explicitly shown in this
    excerpt, but the response structure indicates offset-based pagination where startIndex
    indicates the current position and itemsPerPage specifies page size. To paginate,
    use startIndex and itemsPerPage as query parameters in subsequent requests.'
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: totalResults (total number of results),
    startIndex (starting index for current page, default 1), and itemsPerPage (number
    of items per page, default 100). These are returned in the response body to indicate
    pagination state, though no explicit request parameters for controlling page number
    or size are shown in the documentation excerpt.'
