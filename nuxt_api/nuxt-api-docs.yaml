notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Nuxt is a free and open-source framework with an intuitive and extendable way to
  create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and
  websites with Vue.js.
- The course is for anyone that wants to learn how to build professional websites!
- Official certification of competence for the Nuxt Framework.
- Real world web applications built with Nuxt around the world
- An open source framework under MIT license that makes web development simple and
  powerful.
- Uses CSS-first configuration for theming
- Semantic color system with 7 color aliases
- You are on the v4 branch, check out the v3 branch for Nuxt UI v3 or v2 branch for
  Nuxt UI v2.
- Production-ready templates built with best practices, SEO optimized, performance
  tuned, and ready to deploy to production immediately with minimal configuration.
- Edit your Nuxt Content website with Studio, our CMS platform with Notion-like Markdown
  editor and generated forms for YAML and JSON files.
- Nuxt DevTools v2 requires Nuxt v3.15.0 or higher.
- DevTools is enabled by default in Nuxt v3.8.0.
- Start using Nuxt DevTools quickly by installing it in your projects in a few lines!
- Get real-time insights into your app's performance.
- Understand your Nuxt app structure to debug and optimize your Nuxt application effectively.
- Currently the only way to contribute to Nuxt DevTools View is via iframe.
- Uses Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to pages
- Content excerpt or summary can be extracted from the content using <!--more--> as
  a divider
- Nuxt DevTools is enabled by default in Nuxt v3.8.0.
- If you have the legacy module `nuxt-icon` installed, you might want to remove it
  from the `modules` list.
- Nuxt Scripts is in beta, use with caution as some APIs may change.
- Get personalized documentation for your Nuxt application, based on your usage patterns
  and needs.
- Nuxt Scripts aims to improve end-user privacy by providing a simple API for managing
  cookie consent.
- Start using Nuxt DevTools quickly by installing it in your projects in a few lines.
- Currently the only way to contribute to Nuxt DevTools View is via iframe. You need
  to serve your module's view yourself and then register it to the DevTools.
- The Nuxt DevTools repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces.
- Nuxt DevTools uses pnpm v8.
- You may also know you can install `@iconify/json` package to include all iconify
  icons. This is not recommended because it will increase your server bundle size
  and building performance.
- 'A simpler method is now available: directly input the script URL into scripts.globals.'
- Nuxt Scripts lets you load third-party scripts with better performance, privacy,
  security and DX.
- Facade components are fake UI elements that get replaced once a third-party script
  loads.
- Bundling occurs during the build phase through static code analysis.
- It is possible to set environment variables for testing by using the .env.test file.
- Scripts load only after the page is fully interactive. This minimizes impact on
  Core Web Vitals and user experience.
- The `onNuxtReady` trigger ensures scripts load after Nuxt hydration is complete,
  when the browser is idle and the main thread is available.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- The globals configuration will be used to create a virtual Nuxt plugin that loads
  in the script using the useScript composable.
- Static values are required for bundling scripts.
- When you run your tests within the Nuxt environment, they will be running in a happy-dom
  or jsdom environment.
- You can't reference local variables in the factory function since they are hoisted.
