auth_info:
- information_source; https://templated.io/docs/:
  - Templated API uses API key authentication. The API key must be obtained from the
    API Integration tab in your dashboard and sent with requests to generate renders
    (images or PDFs). The exact header name and parameter format for sending the API
    key is not specified in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://templated.io/docs/templates/list/:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The API
    key should be included as "Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}" where apiKey is your
    API key value. Send this header with all requests to the API endpoint.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {apiKey}". The API key should be stored in the
    variable apiKey and passed as "Authorization: Bearer " concatenated with the key
    value in the HTTP request header.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {API_KEY}" for all requests to the /v1/templates endpoint and
    other protected endpoints.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {api_key}". The api_key value should be obtained separately
