auth_info:
- information_source; https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog:
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization header
    or as a query parameter. If the key expires, renew it at https://example.com/api/renew-key.
- information_source; https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json:
  - Private registries require authentication via headers. The Authorization header
    accepts a Bearer token from the REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable, and custom
    headers like X-API-Key can be configured using environment variables (e.g., ${API_KEY}).
    Headers are specified in the registries configuration with environment variable
    substitution using ${VARIABLE_NAME} syntax.
- information_source; https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace:
  - 'Authentication uses two required headers: X-API-Key (passed via API_KEY environment
    variable) and X-Workspace-Id (passed via WORKSPACE_ID environment variable). For
    private registries, Bearer token authentication is supported via Authorization
    header with token value from PRIVATE_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. All
    credentials should be stored in .env.local and never committed to version control.
    HTTPS is required for all registry URLs to encrypt credentials in transit.'
  - Registries that require authentication use the object format with a headers field.
    The Authorization header accepts Bearer tokens via the format "Bearer ${REGISTRY_TOKEN}",
    and custom headers like "X-API-Key" can be set to "${API_KEY}". Environment variables
    in the format ${VAR_NAME} are automatically expanded from process.env at runtime.
    Both headers and params fields support environment variable substitution.
  - The "@private" registry requires the REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable for authentication.
    This token must be set in your .env or .env.local file and is used to authorize
    access to private registry resources. Authentication failures (401 Unauthorized)
    indicate missing or invalid credentials, while 403 Forbidden errors suggest the
    token lacks necessary permissions for the requested resource.
