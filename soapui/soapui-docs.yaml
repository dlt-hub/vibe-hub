auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.soapui.org/docs/soap-and-wsdl/authenticating-soap-requests/:
  - SOAP requests support HTTP Basic Authentication with username and password credentials
    sent in the HTTP Authentication header. For SOAP-specific security, the UsernamePassword
    standard adds Username, Password, Nonce, Created, and Expired elements to the
    request body; preemptive authentication must be enabled to send the HTTP Authentication
    header before the server challenges. WSS (Web Services Security) configuration
    can be created at the project level to customize the UsernamePassword header with
    additional control over these elements.
