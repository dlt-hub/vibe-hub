auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/using-a-publisher/:
  - 'PyPI uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) token exchange for authentication. First, obtain
    an OIDC token by sending a bearer token in the Authorization header to the ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL
    endpoint with audience parameter set to "pypi". Exchange this OIDC token for an
    API token by sending a POST request to https://pypi.org/_/oidc/mint-token with
    the token in the JSON request body as {"token": "..."}. The resulting API token
    is then used as the password parameter in PyPI publish operations, typically via
    the TWINE_PASSWORD environment variable or the password field in gh-action-pypi-publish.'
  - PyPI uses OIDC token exchange for authentication. Generate an OIDC token by running
    `python -m id pypi` (or `python -m id testpypi` for TestPyPI), then exchange it
    for a short-lived API token via POST to `https://pypi.org/_/oidc/mint-token` (or
    `https://test.pypi.org/_/oidc/mint-token` for TestPyPI) with JSON body containing
    the token field. The resulting API token is used with twine via environment variables
    TWINE_USERNAME set to `__token__` and TWINE_PASSWORD set to the token value.
  - 'The authentication uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) token exchange. Retrieve an OIDC
    token from GitHub Actions using the ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN header and
    ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL environment variable with audience parameter (audience=pypi
    for PyPI, audience=testpypi for TestPyPI), then exchange it with PyPI via POST
    request to get a short-lived API key for use with tools like twine. The GitHub
    Actions workflow requires id-token: write permissions.'
  - The authentication uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) tokens exchanged for short-lived
    API tokens. The OIDC token is retrieved from GitHub Actions via the Authorization
    header with bearer token scheme using the ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN environment
    variable, then exchanged at the PyPI OIDC endpoint for an API token. The resulting
    API token is passed to twine via TWINE_USERNAME set to __token__ and TWINE_PASSWORD
    set to the API token value.
- information_source; https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/:
  - The Upload API requires HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials (username and password)
    must be sent in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme, encoded in base64
    format as "username:password". This is the standard authentication method used
    by tools like twine to upload distributions to PyPI.
