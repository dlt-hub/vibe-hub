auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/ZdXD/call-rest-api-using-http-json-from-ue5-c:
  - Space-Track.org REST API uses HTTP POST with form-encoded credentials. Authentication
    requires sending identity and password as POST body parameters (identity=<username>&password=<password>)
    along with the query, allowing login and data retrieval in a single call. The
    Content-Type header must be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
- information_source; https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/connect/connect-reference:
  - ID Tokens are JWTs obtained after EOS Connect authentication and must include
    the `kid` parameter in the header. Backend services validate tokens using the
    JWKS endpoint at https://api.epicgames.dev/auth/v1/oauth/jwks with standard JWT
    libraries that support automatic JWKS caching.
- information_source; https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication with authorization code flow for server-side applications.
    Client credentials (Client ID and Secret) are passed via Basic Authorization header
    to the token endpoint at https://api.epicgames.dev/epic/oauth/v2/token. The server
    exchanges an authorization code for an access token, then includes the access
    token on all subsequent requests to Epic services. POST parameters include grant_type,
    deployment_id, and scope. Token revocation uses https://api.epicgames.dev/epic/oauth/v2/revoke
    per RFC 7009.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with JWT access tokens. Client redirects user to
    authorization endpoint with client_id, redirect_uri, response_type=code, and scope=basic_profile.
    After user authenticates, authorization code is returned via redirect with optional
    state parameter for CSRF protection. Exchange authorization code for access token
    using authorization_code grant type. Access tokens are JWTs validated offline
    using public keys from JWK Set endpoint at https://api.epicgames.dev/ (endpoint
    URL appears truncated in documentation).
  - OAuth2 password grant flow with Basic authentication. Send POST request to /epic/oauth/v2/token
    with Authorization header using Basic auth (base64-encoded credentials), and include
    grant_type, deployment_id, scope, username, and password in the request body as
    form-urlencoded data. The response provides access_token, expires_in, expires_at,
    account_id, client_id, and application_id. For token refresh, use grant_type=refresh_token
    with refresh_token parameter in the request body.
