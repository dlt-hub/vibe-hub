auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.9/user-guide/nodes.html:
  - Child node to parent node authentication uses OAuth over SSL. The child node downloads
    content from the parent using HTTPS with a client certificate signed by the Pulp
    CA, stored at /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/node.crt with the private key. The certificate
    is generated by pulp-gen-nodes-certificate and must be regenerated if the Pulp
    CA changes after installation.
  - The child node authenticates to the parent node's REST API using OAuth. The connection
    is SSL but no client certificate is required.
- information_source; https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.9/dev-guide/integration/rest-api/authentication.html:
  - HTTP basic authentication is required for REST API calls. Credentials can be provided
    directly as username and password in the Authorization header using the Basic
    scheme (RFC 1945 section 11.1), or by first obtaining a client SSL certificate
    via POST to /pulp/api/v2/actions/login/ with basic auth credentials, then using
    that certificate for subsequent requests.
