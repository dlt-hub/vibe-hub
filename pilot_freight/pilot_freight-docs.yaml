auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.aftership.com/docs/shipping/quickstart/api-quick-start:
  - API keys are generated from the API Keys page and can be used in both sandbox
    and production environments. The API key should be sent with requests to authenticate
    access to the endpoints at https://sandbox-api.aftership.com/postmen/v3 (sandbox)
    or https://api.aftership.com/postmen/v3 (production), both accessible only via
    HTTPS.

  - AfterShip uses API key authentication. The API key must be included in the request
    header as `as-api-key`. You can generate your API key from the API key management
    portal at organization.automizely.com/api-keys.
  - Each webhook request includes an aftership-hmac-sha256 header containing a base64-encoded
    HMAC-SHA256 signature generated from the webhook request body and your account's
    webhook secret. Verify this signature to authenticate webhook requests from AfterShip.
  - Webhook requests are authenticated using an HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature
    is a base64-encoded HMAC generated from the webhook request body and your account's
    webhook secret, and is sent in a header (header name not explicitly stated in
    excerpt, but context indicates it is a signature verification header). To verify
    webhook authenticity, compute HMAC-SHA256(webhook_body, webhook_secret), encode
    as base64, and compare against the received signature header value.

  - AfterShip Tracking API uses API key authentication. Include the `as-api-key` header
    in all requests with your API key obtained from the API key management portal
    at https://organization.automizely.com/api-keys. The API key must be passed as
    a header parameter named `as-api-key` to verify each request.
