notes:
- Community focused on security products which help you secure identities, applications,
  and data.
- The current approach to certificate management in the NetIQ suite of products is
  really showing it's age.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Super User Program Public Details requires membership for participation
- This community is no longer accepting new participants or content contributions.
- Letting you move beyond username and password to a more secure way to protect your
  sensitive information with Advanced Authentication.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This neighborhood within our community is focused on supporting the OpenText Threat
  Detection and Response (ArcSight) group of products.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The community is focused on discussions about Connect which is a tool used to synchronize
  item and relationship data between change and configuration management systems and
  other repositories or clients.
- Consideration Before Upgrading to DA 6.3.4
- 'Workaround: create manually LR template in Analysis - then need to copy the report
  template in LRE Host/DP machine bin/dat/reporting folder and change the template
  to reflect the new report'
- We still face the same problem in LRE SaaS 25.3.
- Device Connection Issues with Digital Lab Portal on Mac Connector
- Database Connection Pool Exhaustion in UFT Digital Lab Causing System-wide Failures
- PulseUno 22.1 supports JRE version 9 and later
- Software Delivery Management Ideas
- Sprinter fails to authenticate when trying to log into Software Delivery Management
- OAuth 1.0 token requires a POST API call with specific header entries.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication
- Some discussions may have missing or incomplete data
- Some objects like DeviceLogReports may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Focused on discussions around helping organizations meet regulatory and data privacy
  guidelines through robust content management.
- ControlPoint has been retired from development – it is only in maintenance mode
  to support some remaining existing customers.
- The documentation is merely slightly out of date. OES 2018 SP3 is fully supported
  by Storage Manager 5.3.
- Virtual Machine Explorer (VMX) has been out of committed support since July 2021.
  This also means there is no new development happening on VMX and support for newer
  versions of VMware ESXi or Windows Hyper-V will not be available.
- Thank you guys for providing some insight into resolving some of the most common
  issues.
- In future, certificates will be permitted for a maximum period of 48 days.
- IDM and all associated components should support ACME so that certificates can be
  replaced centrally.
- Manual renewal of certificates is inefficient and will not be possible in future.
- The REST Driver Pull should have an option to set a specific time (cron format -
  like with jobs) for when the pull should be executed.
- It should be possible to set this and it should be per configured resource.
- Pull on time not every so many minutes
- In some cases it is not desirable to have the pull run every x minutes, but on a
  specific time like, Saturday morning at 9am.
- Support the session disconnect by user ID but how about the disconnect condition
  by specific IP address?
- IG crashes silently and when check for tomcat servicing port, the port is not servicing
  at all. This is happening frequently.
- 'The tomcat version we are using is: Apache Tomcat Version 9.0.102'
- The Fortify suite of products is scheduled to be FIPS compatible in a future release.
- If the LIM is running on a FIPS enabled platform, licenses may fail if non-FIPS
  compliant algorithms are used.
- A2210223 Server does not trust my certificate path.
- A .pse file with the private key and the public key from the opposite SAP system
  is required.
- An SAP user (service user) that is also configured accordingly in SAP SNC is needed.
- Server does not trust my certificate path.
- According to the SAP team, it should be sufficient if I have the ROOT-CA in my .pse
  store.
- There was still some work to be done on the SAP side. There, SNC also had to be
  configured for the service user in the same way as in IDM.
- Similar to RemoteLoader/IDM with the RL/Driver password in principle
- ROOT-CA should be in the .pse store, self-signed certificates are acceptable.
- Alert for excessive response times mentioned in the documentation.
- 'Alert Excessive response time, start: xxx PM end:xxxxPM, 91 requests avg response,
  24835 ms, threshold ms:500'
- Alerts do not always indicate that there is a scan quality issue. Some alerts may
  be false positive. However, alerts may provide insight into issues that could adversely
  affect the scan.
- 'Possible cause: Responses coming from the web server are taking longer than average
  (defined at 500ms) or longer than expected. A longer response time may result in
  a slower scan and potential timeouts.'
- Using a contract with a persistent authentication class/method for username/password
  and a second method that a risk-based authentication class/method for the MFA challenge
  via NAAF.
- Works for username/password handled by NAM but prompts for MFA integration with
  NAAF.
- If contract has multiple methods, they are all independent from each other.
- Only relation between them is that they need to be triggered in configured order
  and all need to be successful for contract to authenticate user.
- Enhanced AI features through the Aviator platform.
- Integration with Microsoft Copilot for summarizing documents.
- The OpenText Learning Platform requires authentication for API access.
- Community Login will be down February 7, 2022 from approximately 6:30 pm PT until
  midnight PT due to a migration.
- Discussion forums have social sharing buttons.
- Remote control may fail without a physical monitor attached.
- Remote control failing without physical monitor attached may cause issues such as
  a black screen or partial screen with incorrect scaling.
- Focused on providing automated endpoint management, software distribution, support,

- The problem does not follow the user account when tested on other computers or when
  logged into another user’s profile on the same PC, indicating the GroupWise profile
  itself is functioning correctly.
- In legacy WebAccess there was Admin console, in which we were able to look on currently
  logged in users with additional information like IP address.
- Putting such information into an audit log is currently more than preferred.
- Not sure if we get something like that in new GroupWise Web, but putting such information
  into a audit log is currently more that preferred.

  folders.
- Folder contains many old zenworks agent versions as .zup files.
- Manual cleanup may be required as automated processes may not work.
- Most of those versions have long been removed from the server side.
- Apart of removing those manually, is there any process that should clean those up?
- Property indicating the interval period for the system update clean up thread executions
  — default value is 12 Hours.
- The size and content of the cleanup folder depends on the age of the machine.
- The folder cleanup process may not be functioning as intended.
- I'd recommend checking to see what is there and uncommenting if it's not cleaning
  up for you.....Maybe set the values low such as 1hr, for testing.

- Staying up to date isn’t just maintenance - it’s momentum.
- Search By Full Name feature was available in ALM 15 but removed in ALM 17.
- In previous version like ALM 15, we are able to use Search By Full Name under Add
  from the User List- Site Administration, while from ALM 17 on this feature is removed.
- Proposed enhancement would provide more control over audit data and improve manageability
  and scalability of ALM.
- Currently, ALM records all project-level changes in the td.AUDIT_LOG table.
- This function will comes handy during ALM upgrade which can prevent data/metadata
  inconsistency in siteadmin_db schema before and after the upgrade with the same
  time and ensuring existing users are able to access ALM portal.
- Allows toggling maintenance mode for SiteAdministration during upgrades.
- Authentication is called NetIQ, Network Access Manager, or OT NAM for some services.
- Authentication is called Covisint, OT Connect, Identity and Access Management or
  IAM for other services.
- It will be a great help to have a Recycle bin QC to recover any accidental deletion
  from users.
- An option is needed to separate content from large projects
- This is really important from GDPR perspective and also disk space saving perspective
- When user tries to login to the project where the user is already logged in, a warning
  is displayed.
- The recycle bin folder should not be visible in Test Plan and Test Lab tree structure.
- User permissions for 'Recycle and Restore' should not be linked to delete permissions.
- '''Recycle and Restore'' user permissions in Test Plan should not be linked to ''Test
  case delete'' and ''Test folder delete'' permissions.'
- '''Recycle and Restore'' user permissions in Test Lab should not be linked to ''Test
  set delete'' and ''Test set folder delete'' permissions.'
- The goal is to provide a better way to 'delete' items with the ability to restore
  them.
- Best practice should be to enable the 'Recycle and Restore' permission and to disable
  the 'Delete' permission.
- When running a manual test, images added to the test step's actual result are not
  saved to the Test Plan module.
- Some lookup list fields in ALM are lengthy and having a way to quickly search for
  the value to select would be great.
- Issues with registering new OpenText Community accounts have been resolved.
- The ALM Desktop Client requires functionality for searching and auto-fill on Lookup
  List fields.
- For enabling the search option, you should create a tree-like structure list.
- 'The condition is: OS 64 Bit, MSWord 32Bit, add-in installed 32Bit, ALM Client Registered
  as 32Bit.'
- Implications of adding a user defined function (udf) to an ALM database include
  potential issues with HTML code in reports.
- Users don't have local administrative rights on their desktops.
- 'During deployment, redirect the installation path to a location where standard
  users have write access, such as: C:\ALMLabService or %LOCALAPPDATA%\ALMLabService.'
- If you must keep the installation in Program Files, you can try pre-configuring
  folder permissions using a script during deployment.
- We are currently unable to connect to QC ALM.
- 'When attempting to log in, the following error message appears: ''Failed to login.
  Please contact system administrator for help. Description: Authentication failed.
  Verify your username.'''

- The error during password reset is often linked to missing or misconfigured site
  parameters, especially those related to email functionality.
- If any of these are missing or incorrectly configured, it can cause issues with
  email-based workflows like password resets.
- When a user clicks the forgot password link, they get the email to allow them to
  reset password, however when they click the link, they get a general error.
- 'Please check if the following site-level parameters are added and populated with
  correct values in Site Administration: SMTP_ADMIN_MAIL – should contain a valid
  admin email address, MAIL_SERVER_HOST – the hostname or IP address of your SMTP
  server, MAIL_PROTOCOL – typically set to SMTP, MAIL_SERVER_PORT – default 25.'
- After updating, restart the ALM service and test the reset flow again.

- The Excel report generation process in the Dashboard > Analysis View menu is not
  customizable via workflow scripts.
- This approach is independent of Excel and works well in environments where Office
  is not installed.
- The Excel report generation process in the Dashboard > Analysis View menu is not
  customizable via workflow scripts. The output format and generation logic are tightly
  coupled with Excel and cannot be redirected to .csv through ALM’s workflow.
- You can use ALM’s REST API to query the relevant entities (e.g., defects, test runs,
  test sets) and extract the data externally.
