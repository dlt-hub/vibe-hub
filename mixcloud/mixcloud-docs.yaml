auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/:
  - Access tokens are required and must be passed as the access_token query parameter
    in the URL. Send POST requests to perform actions (follow, favorite, repost, add
    to listen later) and DELETE requests to undo them, or alternatively send POST
    with method=delete parameter to simulate a DELETE request.
  - Access tokens are required and passed as query parameters. Include access_token=INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
    as a query parameter in API requests. The example shows uploading with curl using
    the access_token query parameter in the URL to authenticate requests to the Mixcloud
    API.
  - Access tokens are required for updating data and accessing the /me/ endpoint,
    and must be provided over HTTPS connections only. The access token should be included
    in requests to authenticate the user, though the specific header or parameter
    name for passing the token is not explicitly stated in this documentation excerpt.
  - Access tokens are required to upload shows to the Mixcloud API. POST requests
    to https://api.mixcloud.com/upload/ must include an access token (referenced in
    the Authorization section). The token should be sent as part of the request, and
    uploads use multipart/form-data encoding with required fields including mp3 and
    name, along with optional metadata and image fields.
  - Mixcloud API uses OAuth2 access tokens for authentication. Pass the access token
    as a query parameter named access_token in requests to endpoints like https://api.mixcloud.com/upload/
    and https://api.mixcloud.com/upload/[YOUR_SHOW_KEY]/edit/. The token must be obtained
    through the Authorization flow documented in the Mixcloud developers section.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query string parameters to page lists. Lists
    with dates (uploads) can alternatively use since and until query string parameters
    accepting Unix timestamps or UTC datetime format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). Response
    includes previous and next page URLs; add offset=0 to the first request to use
    offset-based pagination instead of date-based defaults.
