auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.elevio.help/en/articles/67-rest-api-authentication-and-authorization:
  - 'The Elevio API uses two-part authentication: an API key for account identification
    and rate limiting, plus a JWT for resource access control. Both must be generated
    from the API Keys dashboard and included as headers in every request: `x-api-key`
    header with your API key value, and `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer
    YOUR_JWT`. Multiple key-token pairs can be created for different purposes and
    revoked individually if compromised.'
- information_source; https://api-docs.elevio.help/en/articles/72-rest-api-search:
  - 'The Elevio API Search endpoint uses optional access control parameters passed
    as query strings: user_email (user''s email address), group (array of user groups,
    one per query parameter), and hash (user hash). These parameters are optional
    and used to filter content based on user access permissions; refer to the linked
    article for detailed access parameter configuration.'
- information_source; https://api-docs.elevio.help/en/articles/92-graphql-api-introduction:
  - First, you will want to read the authentication and authorization documentation
    as every request must be authenticated. Once you have a key-token pair, you can
    start exploring the API.
- information_source; https://api-docs.elevio.help/en/articles/93-graphql-api-authentication-and-authorization:
  - 'The Elevio GraphQL API uses two credentials sent as HTTP headers: an API key
    for account identification and rate limiting, and a JWT for resource access control.
    Generate both from the API Keys dashboard, then include x-api-key header with
    YOUR_API_KEY and Authorization header with Bearer YOUR_JWT in each request.'

    (defaults to 100, maximum 500). The response contains an articles array; continue
    paginating by incrementing the page parameter until no more articles are returned.'
  - Pagination uses page_size (default 100), total_pages, and total_entries in the
    response. Request pages via query parameter (exact name not shown in excerpt),
    and stop when current page reaches total_pages.
- information_source; https://api-docs.elevio.help/en/articles/72-rest-api-search:
