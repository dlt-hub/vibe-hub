auth_info:
- information_source; https://listmonk.app/docs/apis/apis/:
  - 'HTTP API requests support two authentication methods: BasicAuth using credentials
    as "api_user:token", or an Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    token api_user:token". API users and tokens are created and managed in the admin
    UI under Admin > Users, and permissions are controlled through User roles and
    List roles that can be attached to users.'
- information_source; https://listmonk.app/docs/apis/lists/:
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, here is the auth information:


    The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent via the Authorization
    header using the format "api_user:token" encoded in base64. In curl, this is specified
    with the -u flag as -u"api_user:token", which translates to an Authorization header
    with value "Basic " followed by the base64-encoded credentials.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as username and password
    using the -u flag in curl, formatted as "api_user:token" in the Authorization
    header with base64 encoding.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the credentials format "api_user:token"
    passed via the -u flag in curl, which translates to an Authorization header with
    value "Basic base64(api_user:token)". The username is "api_user" and the password
    is a token that must be provided for each request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://listmonk.app/docs/apis/lists/:
  - Pagination for GET /api/lists uses query parameters page (default 1) and per_page
    (default 20), with response fields total, per_page, and page indicating pagination
    state. Continue to the next page by incrementing the page parameter until page
    exceeds total divided by per_page.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter page (number) for page-based pagination.
    The response structure for indicating total pages or next page information is
    not documented in this excerpt.
