auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.oxfordsemantic.tech/3.1/programmatic-access-APIs.html:
  - 'The RESTful API uses basic HTTP authentication. Include an Authorization header
    with the value "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "role_name:password"
    (e.g., "Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l" for role "Aladdin" with
    password "OpenSesame"). This header must be included with each request since the
    API is stateless. If no Authorization header is present, the request is processed
    with default role "guest" and password "guest"; the guest role can be deleted
    to prevent anonymous access.'
- information_source; https://docs.oxfordsemantic.tech/5.2/programmatic-access-APIs.html:
  - Authentication uses an Authorization header with the format "RDFox" followed by
    a token (e.g., "RDFox 11111222223333344444"). Include this Authorization header
    in requests to authenticate with the RDFox API.
  - 'RDFox supports two authentication methods: basic authentication using role name
    and password, or RDFox authentication scheme using an Authorization header with
    the format "Authorization: RDFox <token>" where the token is obtained when the
    connection is created. The role name in basic auth must match the connection''s
    associated role, and the password must be valid at request time.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header as a Base64-encoded string in the format "Basic base64(username:password)".
    For example, "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjE6dXNlcjE=" represents the credentials
    for user1. The authenticated role can change its password via a PUT request to
    /password with the old and new passwords separated by a newline character in the
    request body.'
  - The API uses role-based authentication via the Authorization header (basic auth)
    to specify a role name and password when creating a connection. If no Authorization
    header is provided, the guest role is used. After connection creation, subsequent
    requests must include the connection ID as a query parameter (connection=<ID>)
    and can optionally use the RDFox-Authentication-Token header returned in the connection
    response for additional authentication verification.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.oxfordsemantic.tech/3.1/programmatic-access-APIs.html:
  - 'Cursor-based pagination is used where a POST request to `/cursors` with optional
    `limit=n` parameter (default returns all answers) creates a cursor and returns
    the first batch of results. The cursor location is provided in the `Location`
    response header, and subsequent requests fetch additional batches using the cursor
    ID. An `X-Cursor-Exhausted: true` header indicates no more results are available.'
  - Cursors are used to paginate through query results. Create a cursor with a limit
    parameter (e.g., limit=10) in the request, retrieve cursor information via GET
    to access the position property, and use the cursor ID in subsequent requests
    to fetch additional result pages. Close the cursor with DELETE when done.
  - Pagination is supported via `offset=m;limit=n` request parameters, as described
    in Section 8.10 for SPARQL query evaluation. The documentation references Section
    8.10 for details on how these parameters work.
  - 'The API supports two pagination approaches: offset/limit parameters (offset=m;limit=n)
    for standard query result pagination, and explicit cursors managed via the /cursors
    endpoint under transactions. Cursors maintain position and can be listed; each
    cursor has an ID and is user-owned, with 401 Unauthorized returned if accessed
    by a different user than the creator.'
  - 'The API uses cursor-based pagination for query results. Clients POST to a cursor
    endpoint with an optional `limit` query parameter (default: all remaining answers)
    to fetch the next batch of answers in a specified format via `Accept` header.
    Pagination ends when the response includes `X-Cursor-Exhausted: true` header with
    `204 No Content` status code, at which point the cursor is automatically deleted.'
