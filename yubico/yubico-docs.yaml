auth_info:
- information_source; https://console.yubico.com/apidocs/openapi.yaml:
  - Place a request for a shipment using an authentication token associated with your
    organization. The API restricts shipment creation to users whose authentication
    token belongs to the requesting organization.
  - The YubiEnterprise API uses session-based authentication managed through the auth
    tag endpoints. Authentication state is managed via account sessions, and credentials
    are required to establish and maintain a session before accessing other API resources.
  - This API uses authentication tokens to control access. Requests must include an
    authentication token (likely in the Authorization header) that is associated with
    a user's organization. The token determines which organization's data the user
    can access, and certain operations like shipment requests are restricted to users
    whose token belongs to the appropriate organization.
