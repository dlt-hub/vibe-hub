auth_info:
- information_source; https://oomnitza.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16829703987095-Kickstarting-your-webhook-integration:
  - Oomnitza API uses token-based authentication. Generate an API token via Configuration
    > Security > API tokens, then send it with requests to the API endpoint (typically
    https://<mycompany>.oomnitza.com/api/v3/<custom_object_name>). The exact header
    name and token format for including the token in requests are not specified in
    this documentation.
- information_source; https://oomnitza.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17200339347991-Oomnitza-REST-APIs:
  - 'Two authentication methods are supported: Basic Authentication using username
    and password credentials, or API Key authentication using the header Authorization2
    with an Oomnitza API token as the value.'

  : - Datadog API authentication requires an API key passed in the request header.
      The credential should be entered as the DD-API-KEY and configured to be added
      to the header. The endpoint https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/validate can be
      used to test the API key validity. For cloud-based installations, credentials
      are stored in Oomnitza cloud; for local installations, they are stored locally,
      though local installations do not support AWS or OAuth authentication.
    - 'Datadog integration requires two separate keys: an API Key (for authentication)
      and an Application Key (for authorization). The API Key is added via Oomnitza''s
      Credentials interface with Authorization type set to API Key, Token Name set
      to DD-API-KEY, and the key added to the request header. The Application Key
      is stored as a global variable DataDog.Application_Key in Oomnitza''s Configuration
      > General > Global Settings and is used separately in workflows.'
    - Datadog's REST API uses API key authentication. You need to generate an API
      key and an Application Key in Datadog (via Organization settings > API keys
      and Organization Settings > Application Keys respectively) and add both to Oomnitza
      for the integration to work.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://oomnitza.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17200339347991-Oomnitza-REST-APIs:
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit and skip. limit controls the number of
    results per request, and skip specifies the number of records to skip before returning
    results. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the skip value based on
    the limit used.
