auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.bl.ink:
  - 'All endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access token by
    calling POST /access_token with username and password, or username and refresh
    token. Add the token to all requests using the header Authorization: Bearer <access_token>.
    Access tokens expire after 24 hours; the /access_token endpoint always returns
    a valid token so expiration tracking is not needed. Refresh tokens can be used
    as an alternative to passwords for obtaining new access tokens.'
  - The API uses email and password credentials sent in the JSON request body to authenticate.
    The /access_token endpoint returns an authentication token that can be used for
    subsequent requests, and accepts either a password or refresh token for token
    generation.

    the /access_token endpoint always returns a valid token so expiration tracking

  - Authentication uses email and password credentials sent in the request body as
    JSON. The /access_token endpoint returns a valid authentication token that can
    be either an existing non-expired token or a newly generated one; it accepts either
    a password or refresh token for the account.
- information_source; https://developers.bl.ink/api-v3.html:
  - Access tokens are obtained by sending either username/password or username/refresh
    token to the token endpoint. Each API call requires an access token to verify
    the user. Access tokens expire after 24 hours, but the API endpoint always returns
    a valid token so expiration tracking is not required by the client. The token
    endpoint accepts email and password fields in the request body, or alternatively
    email and refresh_token fields. The response includes a success indicator and
    user details.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.bl.ink:
  - Pagination is implemented using offset-based parameters in the response meta object.
    The response includes current_page, previous_page, next_page, last_page, from,
    to, per_page, and total fields. To paginate, use page number parameters in requests
    and reference next_page from the meta object to construct subsequent requests
    until next_page equals last_page.
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata fields: current_page, previous_page,
    next_page, last_page, from, to, per_page, and total. However, no request parameters
    for controlling pagination (such as page, limit, or offset) are documented in
    this excerpt, so the pagination request mechanism cannot be determined.'
- information_source; https://developers.bl.ink/:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters with meta object in response. Request
    parameters: per_page (query, optional, controls items per page) and page or offset
    (query, optional, for navigation). Response includes meta object with current_page,
    next_page, last_page, total, per_page, from, to fields to track pagination state
    and construct subsequent requests.'
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata fields: current_page, previous_page,
    next_page, last_page, from, to, per_page, and total. However, no request parameters
    for controlling pagination are documented in this excerpt, so the pagination scheme
    cannot be fully determined.'
- information_source; https://developers.bl.ink/api-v3.html:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (integer, optional) to specify the page
    number. The response includes total and count fields indicating total results
    and results in current page, with an objects array containing the link data.
