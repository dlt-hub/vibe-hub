    are automatically filtered by the authenticated user''s location based on their
    authorization context.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.pos.dutchie.com/:
  - Use the `page` query parameter (optional, default 1) to request specific pages.
    The response includes `total_count`, `page`, `page_size`, and `has_more` fields
    to indicate pagination state and navigate through results. Continue requesting
    with incremented `page` values until `has_more` is false.
- information_source; https://api.pos.dutchie.com/swagger/v001/swagger.json:
  - Pagination uses PageNumber (starting at 0) and PageSize parameters to control
    page access and items per page. Continue requesting with incremented PageNumber
    values until an empty array [] is returned to detect end of data; no metadata
    fields like total_count or has_more are provided.
  - Pagination uses PageNumber (starting at 0, incremented sequentially) and optional
    PageSize (default 1000, max 10000) query parameters. Stop paginating when an empty
    array is returned; no pagination metadata is included in responses.
  - Pagination uses query parameters PageNumber (starting at 0, incremented sequentially)
    and PageSize (maximum 10,000 customers per page). End of data is detected when
    an empty array [] is returned in the response; no metadata fields like total_count
    or has_more are provided. Continue requesting pages by incrementing PageNumber
    until receiving an empty response.
  - Use PageNumber query parameter starting at 0 for the first request and increment
    it for subsequent requests. Response is an array of up to PageSize purchase orders
    (default 1000) with no pagination metadata; stop when the returned array contains
    fewer items than PageSize.
