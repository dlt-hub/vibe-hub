auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.glean.com/connectors/custom/glean-apis:
  - 'Glean provides three token types for API authentication: Indexing API tokens
    (with configurable rotation period, IP restrictions, data source-specific or global
    permissions, and expiry date), Client tokens (scoped to single user or globally,
    with configurable scopes for Chat/Answers/Search requests and expiry date), and
    Authentication Token API keys (for creating authentication tokens on behalf of
    users, with only one active key allowed at a time). The documentation does not
    specify exact header names, parameter names, or how to send these tokens in requests.'
- information_source; https://docs.glean.com/connectors/custom/troubleshooting:
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>" for API requests to the Glean indexing API
    endpoints.
- information_source; https://docs.glean.com/connectors/native/egnyte/home:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Admin credentials are needed to log into
    Egnyte and initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow. The setup process redirects to Egnyte
    for OAuth login and consent, after which Glean receives authorization to index
    content and manage crawls. Your Egnyte instance domain in the format https://yourdomain.egnyte.com
    must be provided during configuration.
- information_source; https://docs.glean.com/connectors/native/salesforce/about:
  - 'Glean authenticates to Salesforce using OAuth2 bearer tokens. The Authorization
    header with "Authorization: Bearer" scheme is required for API endpoints including
    /services/data/v62.0 for queryAll, sobjects crawling, and object descriptions.
    OAuth2 token acquisition flows use /services/oauth2/authorize and /services/oauth2/token
    endpoints during initial setup.'
  - Glean requires the Salesforce admin to authenticate and set up a token during
    setup. Glean uses the Salesforce REST API (v62.00 by default) via SOQL queries
    to ingest data, with all data stored in the customer's cloud environment.
