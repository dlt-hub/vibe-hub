auth_info:
- information_source; https://global-docs.upbit.com/reference/auth.md:
  - API requests require JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Generate a JWT token
    by signing a query string representation of the request body with your secret
    key, then send it in the Authorization header as "Bearer {jwtToken}". Required
    credentials are ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY, which should be managed securely as
    environment variables. The Authorization header must be included in all authenticated
    requests.
  - Authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Token) bearer tokens. The JWT is created by
    signing a query string with a secret key using the access key and secret key credentials.
    The JWT token is then sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer {jwt_token}".
    The Content-Type header must be set to "application/json".
  - Authentication uses JWT bearer tokens. Create a JWT payload containing access_key
    and nonce (UUID), sign it with your secret key, then pass it in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {jwt_token}" when establishing the WebSocket connection. The
    access_key and secret_key must be provided as credentials.
  - JWT token-based authentication using HMAC256. Create a JWT with claims for access_key
    (your API access key) and nonce (a UUID), signed with your secret key using HMAC256
    algorithm, then send it via the WebSocket connection for authentication.
  - JWT-based authentication is required. Include a JWT token in the Authorization
    header of requests. The JWT payload must include a query_hash field calculated
    from the actual query string (for GET/DELETE requests) or JSON body formatted
    as query string (for POST/PUT requests), using the non-URL-encoded format. The
    Secret Key used to sign the JWT is not Base64-encoded, so do not perform Base64
    decoding when using JWT libraries. Parameter order and exact formatting must match
    between the token and actual request, or validation will fail.
