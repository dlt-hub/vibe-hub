notes:
- Bearer tokens are case sensitive.
- The token is valid for 7 days.
- API calls are rate-limited to 3 requests per second per IP address.
- Tokens must be used in the environment they are generated for.
- Tokens created with client credentials do not require sharing usernames or passwords.
- The access token returned via the OAuth service is identical in functionality to
  the current Streaming Hub User API token.
- FreeWheel V3 APIs use XML. FreeWheel V4 APIs use JSON.
- Requests are limited to 50 resources in the response.
- This API provides various codes related to broadcasting regulations.
- Children should consume no more than a small matchbox size piece of cheese a day
  and lower fat choices are more suitable
- Clearance may not apply on same terms after introduction of revised LHF (Less Healthy
  Foods) restrictions under the provisions of The Health and Care Act 2022 and The
  Advertising (Less Healthy Food Definitions and Exemptions) Regulations 2024
- This is an advertisement for (a) specific Less Healthy Food(s) and must not be broadcast
  between 5.30am and 9pm
- This is not a food that falls under the Less Healthy Food restrictions
- This advertiser is a SME - exempt from LHF restrictions
- Data may be subject to regional restrictions.
- Advertiser name must be unique
- Utilize the cache and limit request frequency to 20 requests/second. Exceeding the
  throttling rate of twenty requests per second will result in failed calls.
- Integrates with Strata SBMS systems.
- The Buzz API uses a REST interface over http to view, create, update and delete
  objects.
- The 2.0 API is not backwards compatible with version 0.5.
- GET requests support pagination and sorting through special query parameters.
- The Roles resources have been updated for the 2.0 API and we recommend using that
  version instead of the 0.5 API.
- If the preview_token field is null, it generally means that the creative is not
  active or that the creative assets are not yet ready.
- Beeswax Data Infrastructure uses an 'at least once delivery' design pattern to ensure
  all events are eventually delivered to customers.
- We always recommend de-duplicating your log-level data on auction_id or conversion_id
  in the case of conversion logs.
- Beeswax highly recommends using date filters with your queries for optimal performance.
