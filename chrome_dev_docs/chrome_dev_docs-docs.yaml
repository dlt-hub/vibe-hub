notes:
- API availability varies by Chrome version and program participation (EPP, origin
  trial)
- Configure correct Cache-Control header to optimize model delivery
- Cache-Control public, max-age=31536000, immutable; ensures content is stable and
  revalidation is unnecessary
- APIs do not require authentication and are designed for in-browser storage.
- IndexedDB can be simplified using wrapper libraries like idb-keyval for key-value
  store operations
- navigator.storage.persist() may return different results based on browser-specific
  rules
- Prompt API runs toString() on JSON input, which can lead to misinterpretations of
  the input
- Only supported on Chrome 138 stable on Windows, macOS, and Linux; not supported
  on ChromeOS or mobile operating systems
- Requires hardware that meets certain specifications
- Language Detector API is client-side, enhancing user privacy.
- API is available from Chrome 138 stable.
- Requires desktop with specific hardware configurations for operation.
- Runs LLM models entirely in browser; uses MediaPipe and TensorFlow Lite for optimization
- Requires specific directory structure for model assets
- API is integrated into Chrome and requires Gemini Nano model to be downloaded separately
- Only works on desktop versions of Chrome
- Requires operating systems: Windows 10 or 11; macOS 13+; or Linux
- Requires at least 22 GB of storage on the volume that contains your Chrome profile
- Requires strictly more than 4 GB of VRAM
- Requires an unlimited data or an unmetered network connection
- Session can be customized with optional parameters like 'topK' and 'temperature'.
- Sessions support abort signals to destroy sessions.
- Initial prompts can be set to provide context.
- Session context is preserved until the limit is reached.
- You can check session usage and quota.
- Clone function to preserve resources while resetting conversation context.
- API integrated in Chrome browser; requires Chrome versions 137 to 142 for origin
  trial.
- Initial model download required for first-time API use.
- API operates under strict hardware requirements including GPU and network specifications.
- Sensitive data can be processed client-side for security
- Context window smaller for client-side, challenging for large documents
- Use 'summary of summaries' technique for large documents
- Structured output support makes the model's response predictable as JSON.
- API is built into Chrome and uses Gemini Nano model which requires download on first
  use
- Supported on desktop only for Windows 10 or 11; macOS 13+; or Linux
- Requires at least 22 GB of storage and more than 4 GB of VRAM
- Requires unlimited data or an unmetered network connection
- Requires Chrome 138 stable or higher
- Works only on desktop environments
- The API is only available through Chrome and during specific version trials
- Requires a significant amount of storage and GPU resources
- APIs are part of origin trials and are available for production use
- ChromeDriver implements W3C WebDriver and WebDriver BiDi standards
- Specific capabilities for Chrome include installing extensions, changing window
  types, and command line arguments
- Available for Chrome on Android and Desktop platforms such as Mac, Linux, Windows,
  and ChromeOS
- This feature is experimental and subject to future changes.
- DevTools is integrated directly into the Chrome browser for debugging and development
  purposes
- Client-side AI protects sensitive data and improves latency
- Cloud AI offers powerful, scalable solutions with regular updates
- Manage the life cycle of your model independently of your extension
- Some APIs are experimental and only available in Chrome Canary.
- Features may be in different release channels like Canary, Dev, Beta, and Stable.
- Chrome flags can activate debugging tools or experimental features.
- Finch experiments are used to roll out new features safely.
- The priority header can only signal the initial priority when the resource was first
  requested
- The WebSocketStream API addresses issues of ergonomics and backpressure missing
  in the original WebSocket API
- Streams API supports async iteration for readable streams
- Attribution Reporting API now supports parsing failure debug reports
- Document picture-in-picture API allows option to hide back-to-tab button
- Specific to encoder configurations and media handling in browsers.
- Major CSS updates include support for multi-argument alt text in CSS Generated Content
  and improvements in text size adjustments.
- Web APIs enhanced with automatic fullscreen settings and updates to WebGPU info
  attribute.
- Media updates include the addition of video chapter in MediaMetadata.
- JavaScript updates include the introduction of importmap integrity.
- Snap Events allow developers to reliably listen for when the snap target of a scroller
  changes
- Aggregate Debug Reporting in Attribution Reporting API provides debug signals in
  aggregate form without third-party cookies
- Keyboard focusable scrollers will be enabled by default starting in Chrome 127
- No-Vary-Search support extends to prerender, allowing cache matching with variable
  URL query parameters
- Compression dictionary transport with Shared Brotli and Zstandard uses previous
  responses as an external dictionary for HTTP compression
- Third-party cookies will begin to be phased out starting Q1 2024 with a complete
  phaseout planned for Q1 2025
- Partitioning of storage, service workers, and communication APIs in third-party
  contexts started from Chrome 113
- API endpoints are illustrative and may not directly reflect actual API paths
- Merging contributions in Private Aggregation API does not impact final outputs like
  summary reports.
- Debug keys only included in the attribution report if third-party cookies are available
  on both the publisher and advertiser site
- Ignore `Strict-Transport-Security` for localhost in Chrome 132
- Allows WebAuthn relying parties to signal information about credentials
- Changes in responseStart and introduction of firstResponseHeadersStart to address
  web compatibility issues
- Deprecated maxInterStageShaderComponents due to redundancy with maxInterStageShaderVariables;
  minor discrepancies manageable within maxInterStageShaderVariables; simplifies developer
  interface
- Removal of special cache handling for <link rel=prefetch> in Chrome; now adheres
  to standard HTTP cache semantics
- Removal of Chrome Welcome page triggering via chrome://welcome in initial_preferences
  file's first_run_tabs property
- Introduces withLock option to all modifier methods
- Introduces a batch modify method
errors:
- If model content needs updating, assign a new URL to the model to avoid cache issues
- File model.bin not found in IDB: Ensure the file was set correctly before getting
    it
- Storage may be cleared under storage pressure: Use navigator.storage.persist() to
    attempt to prevent this
- unavailable: The implementation does not support translation or language detection
    of the given languages
- downloadable: Supports translation but a download is required
- downloading: Supports translation and is finishing an ongoing download
