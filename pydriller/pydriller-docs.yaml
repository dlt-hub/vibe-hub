notes:
- Pydriller supports both local and remote repositories.
- If a URL is passed, Pydriller will create a temporary folder, clone the repository,
  run the study, and delete the temporary folder.
- The list of modifications might be empty if the commit is a merge commit.
- Files that are changed in a commit, but which are written in languages not supported
  by PyDriller (Lizard) are ignored.
- If none of the files changed in a commit are in languages supported by Pydriller,
  the dmm value is None.
