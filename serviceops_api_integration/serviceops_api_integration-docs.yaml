  : - API Key or Access Token authentication is required for the V1 REST API. The
      API Key is generated from the Admin > Automation > Integrations > API Integration
      portal and should be included in the Authorization header of requests, as demonstrated
      in the Create Request API example. Alternatively, an Access Token can be used
      for authorization.

  - Bearer Token authentication is required for SCIM provisioning requests. The token
    is generated in ServiceOps and must be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer
    token when your IdP makes requests to the SCIM endpoint. The SCIM Base URL follows
    the format https://your-instance.serviceops.com/api/scim/v2, and requests must
    include the Authorization header with the value Bearer [token], where [token]
    is the unique token generated during SCIM configuration setup.

      Key can be generated from the Admin > Automation > Integrations > API Integration

      Alternatively, an Access Token can be used for authorization instead of the
      API Key.
