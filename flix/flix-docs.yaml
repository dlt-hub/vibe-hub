auth_info:
- information_source; http://docs.flix-dev.com:
  - Authorizations use SignedAuth, which is a custom authentication scheme. Exact
    details on how to construct or pass SignedAuth credentials (headers, parameters,
    or request body fields) are not specified in this documentation excerpt.
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication via Google is required. The endpoint accepts a POST request
    with a JSON body containing a "provider" field set to "Google". Upon successful
    authentication, the response includes an "id" and "secret_access_key" that should
    be used in subsequent API requests as authentication credentials.
  - Replace metadata for an episode requires SignedAuth authorization. Credentials
    must be sent using the SignedAuth scheme, which is a custom authentication mechanism
    specific to this API.
  - SignedAuth is required for all settings endpoints. Send requests with a signature
    header or mechanism that proves the request is legitimately signed by an authorized
    client, though the exact header name and signing algorithm are not specified in
    this documentation.
  - SignedAuth is required for both archiving and restoring shows. This is a custom
    authentication scheme (likely HMAC or signature-based) where requests must be
    signed, though the exact mechanism for generating and sending the signature is
    not detailed in the provided documentation excerpt.
