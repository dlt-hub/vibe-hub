notes:
- For DSN-less connections, try keeping the Connection string configurable as the
  driver name will change with each new release.
- Use release-independent directories when you don't expect your application to be
  negatively affected by installing new versions of the driver.

  plain text and can be viewed by any user with read-access to the file. Using this
  feature is not recommended, because it is deprecated.
- Using any of the logging options will significantly degrade performance. Enable
  logging only long enough to capture an issue.
- Set the LogLevel key to 0 to disable logging.
- Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 for developing custom Windows applications.
- Object names can be extended up to 128 characters and contain an extended variety
  of characters.
- User name, password, account string, and default database names can be used with
  both the extended length and the extended set of characters in the connection string.
- SSO permits a user to log on to a computer or workstation one time and thereafter
  access the database without repeatedly entering a username and password.

- If you are using a DSN-Less connection, then you must use a driver name that exists
  in your odbcinst.ini file.
- You can have 15.10.01x and/or 16.10, 16.20, 17.00, 17.10 and 17.20 all installed
  side-by-side.
- If the ODBCINI environment variable is set to a release-independent odbc.ini file,
  then the application will be using the active TTU version of the driver.
- If using a DSN-Less connection, use a driver name that exists in your odbcinst.ini
  file.
- For release independent odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini files, the default driver name
  to use is Teradata.
- The Teradata ODBC Driver installation creates a set of symbolic links for the DataDirect
  ODBC Driver Manager.
- An application may be affected if the symbolic links are pointing to a newer or
  older version of the driver manager.
- There are two ways to determine which driver manager is used.
- System DSNs can be found in the odbc.ini files in the default location of /Library/ODBC/.
- For 16.20 and beyond, the default driver name is Teradata Database ODBC Driver XX.YY
  where XX.YY is the version.
- Inside the release independent directory (/Library/Application Support/teradata/client/ODBC)
  there is an odbc.ini file and symbolic links for lib and include which will be pointing
  to the corresponding directories for the active TTU.
- System DSNs can be found in the odbc.ini files in the default location of /Library/ODBC/
- User DSNs can be found in ~/Library/ODBC/
- The driver location given in /Library/Application Support/teradata/client/ODBC/odbc.ini
  is Driver=/Library/Application Support/teradata/client/ODBC/lib/tdataodbc_sb64.dylib
  which corresponds to /Library/Application Support/teradata/client/17.20/lib/tdataodbc_sb64.dylib
  if 17.20 is the active TTU.
- Many changes in behavior were introduced with ODBC Driver for Teradata 16.20.
- Starting with the 16.20 version of ODBC Driver for Teradata, the driver name is
  Teradata Database ODBC Driver XX.YY where XX.YY is the version.

- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata converts the output data to the specified
  SQL type, or returns a conversion error if the types are not compatible.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata returns an additional custom column
  'USER_DATA_TYPE' at index 20.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata uses SQL_WVARCHAR for string columns.
- ODBC Driver for Teradata supports binding for SQL_DECIMAL and SQL_NUMERIC data that
  has a precision of 0, in order to support binding for NULL values.
- When calling SQLBindParameter with a data type that contains fractional seconds,
  you must set the DecimalDigit to a value up to 6, the maximum the database supports.
- Starting with 16.20, the response to timing or processing state of the statement
  has changed in ODBC Driver for Teradata.
- In 16.20, these columns are instead returned as NULL.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata returns additional custom columns
  based on another attribute or hard-coded to a specific value.
- Some options are not available in ODBC Driver for Teradata 16.20.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata can cache, or attempt to cache, up
  to 2 GB of all SLOBS in a row.
- 'Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata includes three new configuration
  parameters: Enable SLOB Random Access, Max size of one SLOB, Max size of all SLOBs
  in a Row.'
- Starting with the 16.20 version of the driver, ODBC Driver for Teradata provides
  a mechanism for testing connections.
- Beginning with 17.00, you cannot save a password to the DSN as this presents a security
  risk.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata uses a proprietary parsing mechanism
  to replace Teradata’s LightWeightParser.
- In 16.10 and prior versions of the driver, when binding any of these types of literals
  as a parameter, ODBC Driver for Teradata accepted literals that contain extra spaces.
- Starting with 16.20, ODBC Driver for Teradata now uses descriptors to get precision
  and scale for SQL_C_NUMERIC data.
- For an existing DSN that already had the password saved in the registry, ODBC Driver
  for Teradata ignores the password value.
