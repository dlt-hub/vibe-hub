- information_source; https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12959542/UV5XjJV8:
  - Postman uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` request
    header with each API call. Generate your API key from the API keys section in
    your Postman account settings. The API key grants access to all resources and
    data you have access to in Postman.
  - The Postman API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key`
    request header for all endpoints except SCIM endpoints, which require a separate
    SCIM API key. Retrieve your API key from the API keys section of your Postman
    account settings. You can store it as a vault secret or environment variable.
    Missing, malformed, or invalid keys return HTTP 401 Unauthorized.
- information_source; https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8538142/2s9Ykn8gvj:
  - Authentication uses a token-based scheme. The token must be passed either as a
    query parameter named `token` (e.g., `?token={{token}}`) or in the request body
    as a JSON field named `token`.
  - 'Authentication uses a two-step process: first, POST to api/login with email and
    password form data to obtain a token, then include that token as a query parameter
    named token in subsequent requests like api/wpbox/me?token={{token}}.'
  - The API requires a token passed in the JSON request body as the "token" field
    for authentication. This token must be included in every request payload to authenticate
    with the API endpoint.
