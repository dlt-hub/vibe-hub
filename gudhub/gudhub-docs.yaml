auth_info:
- information_source; https://gudhub.com/docs/rest-api/auth-rest-api/:
  - This API uses token-based authentication. Send an existing valid access token
    via the query parameter "accesstoken" in a POST request to obtain a new access
    token valid for the next 8 hours. Each token is valid for only 8 hours from issuance.
    The response includes a new "accesstoken" field along with an "auth_key" for subsequent
    requests. Status code 000 indicates unauthorized access due to wrong auth_key.
