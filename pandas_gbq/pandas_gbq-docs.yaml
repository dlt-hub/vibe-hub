notes:
- To use this module, you will need a valid BigQuery account.
- BigQuery is best for analyzing large sets of data quickly. It is not a direct replacement
  for a transactional database.
- If no credentials are found, pandas-gbq prompts you to open a web browser, where
  you can grant it permissions to access your cloud resources.
- A project ID is optional if it can be inferred during authentication, but it is
  required when authenticating with user credentials.
- The destination table and destination dataset will automatically be created if they
  do not already exist.
- As of January 1, 2020 this library no longer supports Python 2 on the latest released
  version.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Python 2 support has been dropped.
- Use caution when using this library on a shared machine.
- To use this module, you will need a valid BigQuery account. Use the BigQuery sandbox
  to try the service for free.
