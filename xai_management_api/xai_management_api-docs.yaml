auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/using-management-api:
  - 'The Management API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your Management
    API Key in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <Your Management
    API Key>" for all requests to authenticate and authorize access to team resources
    and API key management operations.'
- information_source; https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference:
  - API key authentication is required. Include the API key in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token using the format "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". The API key must have
    acl permissions for model and endpoint access (acls field shows "api-key:model:*"
    and "api-key:endpoint:*" as examples).
  - 'Authentication for the xAI Enterprise API requires a Bearer token. Include your
    xAI API key in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer <your xAI API
    key>` with all requests to the base URL https://api.x.ai.'
- information_source; https://docs.x.ai/docs/management-api/auth:
  - API keys are used for authentication, with format `xai-...` (e.g., `xai-2x.....`).
    Access control is managed via ACL strings such as `api-key:endpoint:*` and `api-key:model:*`
    to grant permissions to endpoints and models respectively. API keys can be created,
    updated, and deleted via the `/auth/api-keys` endpoints.
  - API keys are used for authentication. Include the API key in requests (exact header/parameter
    name not specified in this excerpt). API keys support rate limiting via qps (requests
    per second), qpm (requests per minute), and tpm (tokens per minute). Permissions
    are controlled through aclStrings with format api-key:endpoint:[name] or api-key:model:[name],
    or wildcards api-key:endpoint:* and api-key:model:* for all access. Keys can be
    disabled by users to prevent API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/using-management-api:
  - Use query parameters pageSize and paginationToken to paginate the list of API
    keys. pageSize controls results per page, and paginationToken is used to retrieve
    subsequent pages by passing the token from the previous response.
- information_source; https://docs.x.ai/docs/management-api/auth:
  - Use pageSize query parameter to control page size (optional, defaults to returning
    all results in one page). Use paginationToken query parameter to paginate through
    results; set to undefined for the first page and include the paginationToken from
    the response to retrieve subsequent pages. Stop when paginationToken is undefined.
  - Use the paginationToken field from the response to paginate through API keys.
    Include paginationToken as a query parameter on follow-up requests to retrieve
    the next page. When paginationToken is undefined, you have reached the last page.
