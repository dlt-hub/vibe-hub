  auth: To obtain your `accessToken`, you will need a `refreshToken`, which you can
    get by following the instructions in the [get-auth-information](https://your-api-url/reference/get-auth-information)
    documentation, and you can also obtain your `accessToken` directly by following
    the [get-access-token-with-client-credentials](https://your-api-url/reference/get-access-token-with-client-credentials)
    endpoint.

  paginator: Pagination is required for all endpoints that return a collection and
    is implemented using Offset Pagination; the pagination `page` parameter starts
    from `0`, and previously, `0` and `1` were handled equally.
