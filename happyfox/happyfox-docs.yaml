auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.happyfox.com/kb/article/1039-tickets-endpoint/:
  - API key and auth code are to be passed in Basic HTTP authentication format only.
    This means you need to provide credentials as a base64-encoded string in the Authorization
    header using the "Basic" scheme, where the format is "Basic base64(api_key:auth_code)".
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Credentials (username and password) must
    be sent in the Authorization header using the Basic auth scheme (base64-encoded).
    All POST requests must use HTTPS explicitly.
  - 'This API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed in the Authorization
    header as a Basic auth string constructed from an API key and an auth code. Generate
    the Basic auth string using requests.auth._basic_auth_str(v1_api_key, v1_auth_code),
    where v1_api_key is your API Key and v1_auth_code is your AUTH Code, then include
    it in the Authorization header as ''Authorization'': ''Basic <BASIC_AUTH_STRING>''.'

  - 'API key and auth code are passed in Basic HTTP authentication format. Encode
    both credentials as base64 and send in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.happyfox.com/kb/article/1088-get-reports-via-api/:
  - Pagination uses page_count, start_index, and end_index fields in the response
    to indicate pagination state. Request parameters for controlling pagination are
    not explicitly documented in this excerpt, so the exact query parameters (such
    as page or offset) cannot be determined from the provided information.
  - Pagination uses page_count, start_index, and end_index fields in the response.
    The start_index and end_index indicate the current page range, and page_count
    shows the total number of pages available, though request parameters for pagination
    are not shown in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses query parameters size (items per page) and page (page number,
    starting at 1). Response includes page_count (total pages), start_index, end_index,
    and last_index to indicate position within results.
  - The GET /api/1.1/json/reports/ endpoint returns paginated data with response fields
    start_index, end_index, page_count, and last_index to indicate pagination state,
    but no request parameters for controlling page selection are documented in this
    excerpt.
  - Use query parameters size (optional, default 10, max 50) and page (optional, default
    1) to paginate. Response includes page_count (total pages), start_index, end_index,
    and last_index to track position within results.
