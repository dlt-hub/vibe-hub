notes:
- Consistent access to protected targets.
- Built-in retry logic and error handling.
- Web scraping APIs are the most effective solution for bypassing the 403 Forbidden
  error in web scraping.
- Setting a User Agent may not be enough. Combining it with other techniques can help
  in bypassing the 403 Forbidden error.
- Sending too many requests from the same IP address often leads to 403 status code
  errors and even IP bans.
- Free proxies are generally unreliable for web scraping.
- Cloudflare acts as a reverse proxy between you and the target web server, granting
  and keeping access only to human-like requests.
- Free proxies are often unreliable and may not work at the time you're reading this.
  They're suitable for learning purposes, but not for production use.
- Free proxies are often unreliable and have limited effectiveness.
- Premium proxy solutions are recommended for more reliable web scraping.
- Standard headless browsers can't bypass DataDome's security measures because they
  contain obvious bot-like information.
- Using ZenRows can help bypass DataDome.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Headless browsers can be detected by anti-bot systems
- Selenium headless does not bypass anti-bot mechanisms independently.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- ZenRows API handles rotating proxies and headless browsers for you.
- ZenRows auto-rotates up-to-date User Agents and handles anti-bot bypass behind the
  scenes.
- Must comply with GDPR when scraping personal data.
- Use Python's Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
- CSRF token is dynamic and should be retrieved from the HTML.
- Uses an API key for authentication.
- Requires activation of Premium Proxies and JS Rendering.
- APIs handle anti-bot systems better than web scraping.
- APIs provide structured data, unlike web scraping.
- APIs are faster than web scraping.
- APIs offer better stability than web scraping.
- Web scraping requires more technical expertise than APIs.
- Web scraping can be cheaper than APIs.
- APIs are legally safer than web scraping.
- Bypasses anti-bot systems and CAPTCHAs.
- Handles dynamic content through built-in JavaScript rendering.
- Get charged only for successful data extractions, even if retries are needed.
- Fast data extraction collects data in milliseconds with JavaScript-free requests
  and direct HTML parsing.
