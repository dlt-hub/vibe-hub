  - Paygate REST API supports two authentication methods. HTTP Basic Authentication
    uses merchantId as username and API key as password, sent as a base64-encoded
    string in the Authorization header with the word "Basic" prefix. OAuth2 Client
    Credentials Flow exchanges merchantId as client_id and API key as client_secret
    for an access token via POST to https://www.computop-paygate.com/authorization/oauth/token,
    following the standard OAuth2 framework.
  - The API uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow for authentication. To obtain an access
    token, POST to the authorization endpoint with grant_type set to "client_credentials",
    client_id, and client_secret as parameters. The returned access_token must then
    be passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header when calling REST API
    endpoints.
