auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.wibbi.com/:
  - API requests are authenticated using a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer in the request's
    authorization headers. To obtain a new JWT, applications must send credentials
    to the Login endpoint, which returns a token that should be included in subsequent
    requests via the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme.
  - Requests are authenticated using JWT bearer tokens in the Authorization header.
    To obtain a token, POST to https://v4.api.wibbi.com/api/v4/authentication/login
    with JSON body containing username and password fields (licensee admin credentials).
    The response includes a token string and an expires timestamp indicating when
    the token will expire (valid for approximately one hour). For subsequent API requests,
    include the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" where {token}
    is the value returned from login.
