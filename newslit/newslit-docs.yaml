  - Pagination for POST-based search operations uses query parameters following Collection
    Resource conventions. Paging query parameters are maintained in the URL query
    string across subsequent POST requests, enabling hypermedia links to provide next,
    previous, first, and last page relationships.
  - Pagination for collection resources may be automatically provided by the service.
    Clients can specify pagination preferences via query parameters, and the service
    returns paginated results with pagination-related HATEOAS links to navigate through
    the resultset. Refer to the Pagination and HATEOAS links section for specific
    details on linking patterns.

    the page number, page_size specifies items per page. Response includes a links
    array with href URLs containing next and last relations to navigate pages.

    per page), with response fields total_pages indicating total pages and links array
    containing rel="next", rel="prev", rel="first", and rel="self" with href URLs
    for navigation. Increment page parameter to move forward or decrement to move
    backward until page exceeds total_pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page_size and page (both optional). Response
