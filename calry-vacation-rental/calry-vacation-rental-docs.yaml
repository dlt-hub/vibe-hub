notes:
- Calry lets developers in the Vacation Rental Industry ship 40+ native property management
  system (PMS) integrations 10x faster using a single set of APIs.
- We provide a reliable Data Infrastructure for developers to maintain these integrations.
- Offers completely managed data syncs for third-party integrations.
- Calry API gives you a single API to read and write data from software commonly used
  in hotels and vacation rentals.
- Using Calry API's authenticated passthrough request, you can make requests directly
  to the PMS Source Systems (Hostaway, Guesty, Hostfully etc).
- Webhooks are triggered by changes to the Calry system.
- Ensure that your API endpoint is verifying that incoming POST requests are from
  Calry and not a malicious source.
- v1 Unified API end-points will be deprecated by 15th June, 2025.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The `Guest` entity is used within the `Reservation` entity to specify information
  about the guests related to the reservation.
- This entity is in Beta.
- type field will be deprecated from the API and webhook payload by 28th March, 2025.
- messages.type and messages.attachments.url are supported for Hostify only in conversation.updated
  webhooks. They're not supported in API end-points.
- Passthrough requests allow you to access Source System's endpoints directly.
