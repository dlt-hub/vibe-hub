notes:
- Oat++ is used for many different purposes, from building REST APIs that run on embedded
  devices to building microservices and highly-loaded cloud applications.
- Always choose Simple API wherever possible.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Gitee
- Support for API access tokens
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Automatic server URL scheme detection is deprecated. Add https:// or http:// to
  the host explicitly to avoid future breakage.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- New features added for dataset export and import events.
- A trailing slash in hostname doesn't allow SDK to send some requests
- Missed token with using social account authentication
- Some objects aren't shown on canvas sometimes.
- CVAT doesn't offer to restore state after an error.
- Cannot read property 'shapeType' of undefined because of zOrder related issues.
- Cannot read property 'pinned' of undefined because of zOrder related issues.
- Do not iterate over hidden objects in aam (which are invisible because of zOrder).
- Cursor position is reset after changing a text field.
- Hidden points and cuboids can be selected to be grouped.
- '`outside` annotations should not be in exported images.'
- '`CVAT for video format` import error with interpolation.'
- '`Image compression` definition mismatch.'
- Points are duplicated during polygon interpolation sometimes.
- When redraw a shape with activated autobordering, previous points are visible.
- No mapping between side object element and context menu in some attributes.
- Interpolated shapes exported as `keyframe = True`.
- Stylelint filetype scans.
- Fixed toolip closing issue.
- Clearing frame cache when close a task.
- Increase rate of throttling policy for unauthenticated users.
- Helm charts are now available on Docker Hub
- GET /api/events endpoint is deprecated in favor of POST /api/events/export
- Various memory leaks in video reading on the server
- Fixed an issue with calculating the number of objects on the annotation view when
  frames are deleted
- In SDK, we've fixed the issue with creating attributes with blank default values
- CVAT is free, online, interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
