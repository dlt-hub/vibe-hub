auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/2.6/dev-manual/api/api-intro/:
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded credentials passed
    in the Authorization header, or alternatively an API key generated by administrators
    can be passed as a header value with each request. API keys are associated with
    user accounts in AtoM and maintain a chain of custody. The exact header name for
    API key authentication is not explicitly specified in the provided text.
  - The AtoM API uses basic HTTP authentication. Send the user email and password
    in the Authorization header as 'Basic' followed by a base64-encoded string formatted
    as `<user_email@example.com>:<password>`. After the first authenticated request,
    cookies maintain the session for subsequent requests.

  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. First, HTTP Basic Authentication
    using base64-encoded credentials passed in the Authorization header (format: "Basic
    base64(username:password)"). Alternatively, API keys generated by administrators
    can be passed as a header with each request; these keys are associated with user
    accounts and maintain audit accountability.'
