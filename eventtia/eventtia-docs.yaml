auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.eventtia.com/:
  - 'All endpoints for managing users require a valid JWT Token sent as a Bearer Token
    in the Authorization header. The token is passed as Authorization: Bearer {{token}},
    where {{token}} is the JWT access token obtained from authentication.'
  - 'Authorization requires a Bearer Token sent in the Authorization header. The token
    value should be passed as `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}` where `{{token}}`
    is your authentication token.'
  - The API accepts authentication via custom headers. The allowed authentication
    headers are Authorization, X-User-Key, X-User-Token, X-EventAccount-Key, and X-EventAccount-Token,
    as indicated in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header. Credentials
    should be sent as request headers.
  - 'The API accepts multiple authentication methods via headers: Authorization (for
    bearer tokens), X-User-Key and X-User-Token (for user credentials), or X-EventAccount-Key
    and X-EventAccount-Token (for event account credentials). Send the appropriate
    pair of key/token headers with each request.'
  - The API uses machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication with OAuth2-style token exchange.
    Obtain a JWT by sending client_id and client_secret as form data to the m2m-auth
    endpoint, then include the returned access_token in the Authorization header as
    "Bearer <access_token>" for all protected endpoints. The token response includes
    access_token, token_type (Bearer), expires_in, scope, and username fields.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.eventtia.com:
  - All list endpoints use page-based pagination with query parameters page[number]
    (default 1) and page[size] (default 24). The response includes links to first,
    prev, self, next, and last pages, plus a total_pages meta field indicating total
    pages for the current query.
  - Page query parameter accepts a JSON page object for pagination, though the exact
    structure is incomplete in the documentation provided.
  - Pagination uses JSON object parameters page[number] and page[size] in the query
    string. The response includes links (prev, next, last) and meta.total_pages to
    navigate pages. Use page[number] to specify the page and page[size] to set results
    per page.
  - Pagination uses a page object query parameter. Response includes links and meta
    objects for navigation, though specific field names are not fully detailed in
    the provided excerpt.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (JSON object format). Response includes
    links object with self, first, prev, next, and last URLs, plus meta.total_pages
    indicating total pages. Use the next link to fetch the subsequent page until next
    is null.
