auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.shareaspace.com/developer/rest-api/rest-api-usage/batch-operation-api.html:
  - OAuth2 password grant flow with HTTP Basic authentication. Client credentials
    (clientId, clientSecret) are sent as Basic auth header. User credentials (userName,
    password) and grant_type "password" with scope "All" are sent in the POST body
    to the /AuthorizationServer/sasweb/oauth/token endpoint. The response contains
    the access token.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header. The
    access token is provided as a parameter to the batch commit function and set via
    the Authorization header with the scheme "Bearer". The batch endpoint is accessed
    at {baseAddress}/api/space/{spaceId}/batch with a POST request containing JSON
    operations in the request body.
  - The batch API request uses the Authorization and SAs.InformationFilter headers
    from the main batch request itself, so these headers do not need to be duplicated
    in individual operations. Individual operations can include Etag and SAs-UOIVersion
    headers as applicable per the API route and HTTP verb.
- information_source; https://docs.shareaspace.com/sas/security/authentication-authorization.html:
  - ShareAspace uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization combined with an identity provider
    for authentication, issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for REST API authorization.
    Authentication methods include developer login (testing only), email authentication
    with sign-in codes, and OpenID Connect integration with external identity providers
    as an alternative to ShareAspace's built-in Identity Server and Authorization
    Server.
- information_source; https://docs.shareaspace.com/about/changelog-1-7.html:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the value Bearer followed by a JWT token (e.g., Authorization: Bearer eyQWE...)
    in all DELETE requests to the soft delete and tombstone delete endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.shareaspace.com/about/changelog-1-7.html:
  - The `softTypeCompare` API endpoint supports pagination via an optional `pageNumber`
    path parameter (starting at 0) to load specific pages when comparing references
    between two SoftType instances. The resource link for navigation is provided as
    a HAET in the response.
