auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sftpgo.com/2.6/rest-api/:
  - REST API is protected using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or API key authentication, both
    served over HTTPS. Client certificate authentication can be configured in addition
    to JWT. REST API can be disabled via the `enable_rest_api` key in the `httpd`
    configuration.
- information_source; https://docs.sftpgo.com/2.6/tutorials/two-factor-authentication/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the JWT token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}". The token includes claims for audience,
    expiration, permissions, and username.'
  - Two-factor authentication for REST API access is provided via the `X-SFTPGO-OTP`
    HTTP header, which should contain a valid TOTP authentication code. API requests
    also require an `Authorization` header with a Bearer token (JWT format), as shown
    in the example curl command.
- information_source; https://docs.sftpgo.com/enterprise/rest-api/:
  - The REST API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or API key authentication. JWT tokens
    or API keys must be provided to authenticate requests, with support for client
    certificate authentication as an additional security layer. Administrator and
    regular user roles have different permission levels for managing users/system
    settings versus file operations respectively.
