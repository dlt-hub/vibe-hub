auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.escape.tech/documentation/dast/authentication/expert/:
  - This API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Obtain an access token by POSTing
    to https://api.example.com/oauth/v1/token with grant_type=authorization_code,
    client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, and authorization code in the request
    body (application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Extract the access_token from the response
    body and inject it into subsequent requests as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header with the prefix "Bearer ".
- information_source; https://docs.escape.tech/documentation/tooling/api/:
  - Authentication requires passing your API key as a header in requests. The exact
    header name and retrieval location are not specified in this excerpt, but the
    API key should be obtained from your Escape settings and included in request headers.
