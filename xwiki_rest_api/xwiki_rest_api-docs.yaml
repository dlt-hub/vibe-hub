  : - 'Based on the provided text, the authentication information present is:


      Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
      via the curl -u flag. The credentials should be sent in the Authorization header
      using Basic auth scheme. In the example, the username is Admin and password
      is admin. For Python requests, this translates to using the auth parameter with
      a tuple of username and password, or manually constructing the Authorization
      header with base64-encoded credentials in the format "Basic base64(username:password)".'

  : - Basic authentication is required, using username and password credentials passed
      via the auth parameter in HTTP requests. The credentials are sent as a tuple
      (username, password) to the auth parameter, which encodes them in the Authorization
      header as Base64-encoded credentials following the Basic auth scheme.

  - Basic HTTP Authentication is used, with credentials encoded in Base64 format and
    sent via the Authorization header as "Basic [base64-encoded-credentials]". The
    format is username:password encoded in Base64.

  : - 'XWiki supports two authentication methods for its REST API: cookies and basic
      authentication. Basic auth requires storing user passwords in plain text, which
      is not recommended. The documentation suggests exploring token-based authentication
      as an alternative, potentially with read-only or admin-level permissions, though
      specific token implementation details for XWiki''s REST API are not provided
      in this excerpt. A custom Nextcloud-specific integration using a shared secret
      token is proposed as an alternative approach.'
