auth_info:

  - Your application's Access Key and Secret Key must remain confidential and should
    be kept secure, potentially using a proxy if accessing the API client-side. These
    credentials are required for API authentication.
- information_source; https://unsplash.com/documentation:
  - 'Pass your application''s access key via the HTTP Authorization header as `Authorization:
    Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, or alternatively via the `client_id` query parameter.
    For user-specific actions, use OAuth2 bearer tokens obtained through the user
    authentication workflow.'
  - The API requires the `write_collections` scope to update collections. This indicates
    OAuth2 authentication is required, where the client must have been granted the
    `write_collections` scope during the OAuth2 authorization flow. The authenticated
    user making the request must own the collection being updated.
  - The Unsplash API requires the `write_collections` scope for operations that modify
    collections. Authentication is needed to identify the logged-in user whose collections
    are being modified. Credentials should be sent via the standard Authorization
    header (typically as a Bearer token or OAuth2 access token with the `write_collections`
    scope).
  - The Unsplash API uses OAuth2 authentication with scopes. Requests require the
    write_collections scope to modify collections (delete or add photos). Authentication
    is passed via bearer token in the Authorization header, obtained through the OAuth2
    flow with appropriate scopes for the requested operations.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://unsplash.com/documentation:
  - Page-based pagination with page (optional, defaults to 1) and per_page (optional)
    query parameters. Response returns abbreviated photo objects; use GET /photos/:id
    for full details.
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next", and rel="last"
    to navigate pages. Response includes total (total results), total_pages (number
    of pages), and results array. Construct next request using the URL from the Link
    header with rel="next"; stop when rel="next" is absent.
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next", and rel="last"
    to navigate pages. The page query parameter controls which page is requested,
    with page=346 being the last page.
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next", rel="last"
    to navigate pages. Response includes total (237), total_pages (12), and results
    array. Request page via query parameter page (e.g., page=2) in the URL.
  - Pagination uses page (page number) and per_page (items per page) as query parameters.
    The response includes a Link header with rel="last" indicating the final page,
    allowing clients to navigate through paginated collection results.
