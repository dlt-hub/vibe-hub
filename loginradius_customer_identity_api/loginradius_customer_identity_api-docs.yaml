auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.loginradius.com/docs/support-resources/response-codes/customer-identity-api-codes/:
  - LoginRadius uses API key and API secret for authentication, along with access
    tokens that must be verified for expiration. The API key and secret are required
    credentials, and access tokens must be valid and not expired to successfully authenticate
    requests; invalid or expired credentials result in 401/403 errors.
- information_source; https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/v2/customer-identity-api/:
  - API Key and API Secret are required credentials for accessing LoginRadius APIs.
    The API Key and API Secret should be obtained from the Admin Console and used
    when making API requests to endpoints like the Management SOTT API and other identity
    management endpoints. These credentials are essential for generating tokens, testing
    APIs in the API Playground, and authenticating requests to secure endpoints.
  - 'API Key can be passed in query string or header. API Secret must be sent only
    in headers and never exposed publicly. Access Token should be sent in the Authorization
    header using Bearer scheme (Authorization: Bearer <token>). For advanced security,
    optional Request Signing uses HMAC-SHA256 hashing of request expiry time, endpoint
    URL, and payload, with the hash sent in a request header and expiry time in X-Request-Expires
    header (UTC format: yyyy-M-d h:m:s tt). Request Signing must be enabled on the
    LoginRadius account.'
  - 'LoginRadius API uses query parameter-based authentication with two required credentials:
    apikey (API Key) and apisecret (API Secret). These must be passed as query parameters
    in the request URL, as shown in the sample cURL request: ?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&apisecret=YOUR_API_SECRET.
    Replace these with your actual API Key and API Secret values obtained from your
    LoginRadius account.'
  - LoginRadius Identity API uses HMAC-SHA256 request signing with API key authentication.
    Include X-LoginRadius-ApiKey header with your API key, X-Request-Expires header
    with a future UTC datetime, and a Digest header containing SHA-256=<base64_hash>
    where the hash is computed by signing a string composed of expiration time, URL-encoded
    endpoint URL, and JSON payload using your API Secret as the HMAC key.
