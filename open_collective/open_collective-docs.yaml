auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.opencollective.com/help/contributing/development/api:
  - 'The PDF service supports two authentication methods: pass a Personal-Token header
    for personal tokens, or an Authorization header for OAuth tokens.'
- information_source; https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/oauth:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. After user authorization, exchange a temporary
    code for an access token by POST-ing to https://opencollective.com/oauth/token
    with grant_type set to "authorization_code", along with client_id, client_secret,
    code, and redirect_uri as required parameters. The response contains an access_token
    field which is then used to make authenticated API requests.
  - OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required to access the GraphQL API. Include
    the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}". OAuth
    scopes control access permissions and include email, account, expenses, orders,
    transactions, virtualCards, updates, conversations, webhooks, and host. Accounts
    with 2FA enabled cannot use protected queries and mutations unless special permission
    is granted.
