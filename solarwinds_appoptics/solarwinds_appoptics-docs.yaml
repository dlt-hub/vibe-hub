auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/appoptics/content/kb/custom_metrics/api.htm:
  - AppOptics API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API token. The token is passed
    via the Credential parameter in the request (or as Authorization header with Basic
    auth encoding in direct HTTP calls). Send the API token as the username with an
    empty password.
  - AppOptics API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the API token as the username
    and an empty string as the password. The token is passed via the Authorization
    header (or via the -u flag in curl/requests library) in the format token_value:.
    Alternatively, the token can be set via the APPOPTICS_TOKEN environment variable
    and authenticated using the AppOptics client library.
  - The AppOptics API requires authentication with an API token on every request.
    The token is passed using HTTP Basic Authentication with the token as the username
    and an empty string as the password in the auth parameter. API tokens are obtained
    by logging into your account, navigating to Organization settings via your Gravatar
    menu, and accessing the API Tokens page. Refer to the API Tokens and Token Roles
    documentation for more details on token management and available roles.
  - The AppOptics API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Send your API token as the username
    with an empty password in the Authorization header, or use the CURLOPT_USERPWD
    option set to "TOKEN_HERE:" (token followed by a colon). The token should be obtained
    from your AppOptics account and included with every request to the /v1/measurements
    endpoint.

  - 'API access requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Create
    an API Access token via the API Tokens settings, then include it in requests as
    Authorization: Bearer {SWOKEN}, where {SWOKEN} is your generated token string.'
