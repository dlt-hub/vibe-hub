auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/admin/8-sso/2-oauth2:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication using Authorization Code grant flow. Credentials are
    passed to the authorization server via either Basic Authentication (base64-encoded
    client_id:client_secret in Authorization header) or Request Body parameters. The
    system generates a client_id and client_secret upon configuration save. Access
    tokens expire after the configured idle time (e.g., 30 minutes). Scopes define
    access limits and are managed as resources. Refresh tokens can be optionally enabled
    to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/admin/8-sso/3-oidc:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect configuration with the following auth mechanisms:
    Authorization Grant Flow (Implicit flow selected) to acquire access tokens; Client
    Authentication Type via Request Body or Basic Authentication to pass credentials
    to the authorization server; JWT tokens signed with RS-256 algorithm, identified
    by JWT Issuer value; Scopes limit token access permissions; Access tokens expire
    after configured idle time (e.g., 30 minutes); Redirect URL required for post-authorization
    redirect with authorization code or access token; Refresh tokens supported for
    token renewal. OpenID Connect Discovery URL provides OIDC configuration details.'
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/2-api/1-createauthprovider:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication with Implicit grant flow and Basic Authentication. The
    client will receive auto-generated clientid and clientsecret credentials. Configure
    scopes as `[openiam host name]/webconsole/rest/api/*` and `user_name`, with access
    tokens expiring after 30 minutes of idle time. JWT Issuer identifies the client
    (e.g., "Postman client"), and OpenID Connect Discovery URL is auto-generated for
    OIDC application configuration.
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/2-api/2-postmanconfig:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required using the Implicit grant type. Configure
    Postman with clientid and clientsecret variables from your OpenIAM Authentication
    provider, set Grant type to Implicit, Auth URL to https://[openiam server host]idp/oauth2/authorize,
    Callback URL to https://postman:1000/callback, and pass auth data via Request
    headers.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with basic authentication. Auth URL is https://[openiam
    server host]idp/oauth2/authorize. Use ClientId and Client Secret variables, send
    credentials as basic auth headers in the authorization request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/8-api/access-right:
  - 'The GET /rest/api/accessrights/search endpoint supports pagination via query
    parameters: size (integer, optional, controls page size) and from (integer, optional,
    controls offset). The response schema is BeanResponse, which likely contains pagination
    metadata, but specific response fields for navigation are not documented here.'
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/8-api/access-certification:
  - The GET /rest/api/access-certifications endpoint uses query parameters size (integer)
    and from (integer) for pagination. The endpoint also supports sortBy and orderBy
    parameters for sorting. Response schema is BeanResponse but specific pagination
    fields are not detailed in the documentation provided.
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/8-api/auth-provider:
  - The GET /rest/api/authprovider/search endpoint supports offset-based pagination
    using query parameters from (integer, required offset starting position) and size
    (integer, required number of results per page). The response schema is BeanResponse,
    which typically contains paginated results, though specific response fields for
    navigation are not documented here.
- information_source; https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/developerguide/8-api/audit-log:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters `from` (offset, integer
    int32) and `size` (page size, integer int32) for the GET endpoints `/rest/api/auditlog/get/(id)/children`
    and `/rest/api/auditlog/get/(id)/children/docs`. Response structure and stopping
    conditions are not documented.
  - The GET /rest/api/auditlog/findLogs endpoint uses offset-based pagination with
    query parameters from (offset, integer, int32) and size (page size, integer, int32)
    to control pagination. The response structure for pagination fields is not documented
    in the provided excerpt.
