auth_info:
- information_source; https://histology.championsoncology.com/api/v1:
  - HTTP Basic Auth is required for login at the /user/authentication endpoint. Pass
    username and password using HTTP Basic Auth, and the response will include a cookie
    that must be sent in subsequent requests.
  - HTTP Basic Auth is used for login, passing username and password credentials.
    After successful login, a cookie is returned and must be included in subsequent
    requests for authentication.
  - The API uses session-based authentication via authentication cookies. Clients
    can obtain an anonymous or login-associated session token via the GET /token/session
    endpoint, and remove sessions via DELETE /token/session. The system manages authentication
    state through cookies rather than explicit header-based tokens.
  - The API uses token-based authorization. Non-user-associated tokens must be granted
    the "jobs.job_<id>" scope to update a specific job, where <id> is the job ID being
    updated. The exact mechanism for passing the token (header name, parameter name,
    etc.) is not specified in this documentation excerpt.
