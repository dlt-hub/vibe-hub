notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- eID Gateway is an OpenID connect provider that allows the identification of a user
  via an external authentication scheme.
- Your application does not authenticate users but delegates the authentication to
  other Identity Providers.
- Authentication is based on certified and existing identities, allowing your application
  to benefit from strong authentication.
- Possibility of adding other authentication systems (in addition to SPID or CIE).
- Integrate the signature format you prefer, PADES, CADES or XADES
- Leverage on both long-term or one-shot e-signature based on your needs
- Integrate e-sealing functionality for your organisation to automate every process
- GoSign APIs provide a simple solution to manage online signature processes with
  legal value via PC, Web or App Mobile.
- The application can be easily plugged within any existing Customer systems and IT
  infrastructure.
- Signature Validation is the API service that allows to verify electronic, advanced
  or qualified signature, in accordance with the eIDAS Regulamentation and ESI legislative
  specifications.
- The revocation process involves Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate
  Status Protocol (OCSP)
- Safe LTA is a long-term digital preservation system to archive documents with legal
  value.
- Safe LTA guarantees integrity, authenticity, readability and availability to your
  stored digital documents.
- Visit Tinexta Infocert.digital for more information.
- EIDG implements authorization code flow to start OIDC authentication session.

- '<oauth_error>: Summary error code according to OAuth and OIDC.'
- '<eidg_error>: Error code produced by EIDG identifying the specific problem encountered.'
- 'EIDG_5: access_denied - The client_id or client_secret is not valid'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
