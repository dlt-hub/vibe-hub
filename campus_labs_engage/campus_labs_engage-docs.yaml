auth_info:
- information_source; https://engage-api.campuslabs.com:
  - API key authentication is required and can be sent either as the `key` query string
    parameter or the `X-Engage-Api-Key` request header. 401 errors indicate a missing
    API key, while 403 errors indicate the API key is invalid, not authorized for
    the request IP address, not authorized for the endpoint, or the institution lacks
    API access.
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the request header as
    `X-Engage-Api-Key` with the key value (format: `esk_test_*`). Alternatively, the
    key can be passed as a query parameter named `key`, though header-based authentication
    is the preferred method.'
  - API keys are used for authentication and can be passed in either the `headerAuth`
    header or the `queryAuth` query parameter. API keys can be restricted by IP address
    range, HTTP method, and specific endpoints; requests that violate these restrictions
    return a 403 Forbidden response.
  - Requests to the Engage API require an API key passed in the X-Engage-Api-Key header.
    For idempotent requests, include an Idempotency-Key header with a unique UUID
    value to prevent duplicate processing on retries.
  - 'The API uses an API key for authentication that can be passed in two ways: as
    the X-Engage-Api-Key header or as a key query parameter. The API key format is
    esk_test_* for test keys.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://engage-api.campuslabs.com:
  - List endpoints use take (default 10) and skip (default 0) query parameters to
    paginate. Responses include totalItems for total count and items array. Stop paginating
    when the number of returned items is less than the take value or when skip plus
    returned items equals totalItems.
  - Pagination uses query parameters skip (offset) and take (page size) to control
    which results are returned. The response includes a totalItems field indicating
    the total number of available items, allowing clients to determine when all pages
    have been retrieved.
- information_source; https://engage-api.campuslabs.com/:
  - List endpoints support offset-based pagination using query parameters take (default
    10, specifies page size) and skip (default 0, specifies items to skip). Responses
    include totalItems (total count) and items (current page results); construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing skip by take value until skip >= totalItems.
  - Pagination uses query parameters skip and take to control offset and page size.
    The response includes totalItems indicating the total number of records available.
    Use skip to offset results and take to specify how many items to return per request.
