notes:
- Provide translations for your application, and filter and validate internationalized
  values.
- 'Stratigility has dependencies managed by Composer: psr/http-message, http-interop/http-middleware,
  laminas/laminas-escaper.'
- Middleware is code that exists between the request and response, and which can take
  the incoming request, perform actions based on it, and either complete the response
  or pass delegation on to the next middleware in the queue.
- The NotFoundHandler is registered in the innermost layer and returns a 404 condition.
- The ErrorHandler must be the outermost layer of the application.
- The documentation you are viewing is for an older version of this component.
- Version 2 of Stratigility makes several breaking changes to the API in order to
  provide more flexibility, promote interoperability, and reduce complexity.
- In the original 1.X releases, Stratigility would decorate the request and response
  instances.
- Stratigility supports only PSR-15 middleware.
- Handles PHP errors and exceptions via middleware
- Returns 404 status for unhandled requests
- Middleware piped to a MiddlewarePipe must implement the PSR-15 middleware interface.
- We now support only PHP versions 7.1 and above.
- Stratigility now supports only PSR-15 interfaces.
- The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file.
- Make sure that the filename case matches the URL as well as any file permissions.
- File not found indicates that the filename case must match the URL and any file
  permissions.
errors:
- '500 Internal Server Error: Indicates a general server error.'
- '404 Not Found: Indicates that the requested resource was not found.'
