notes:
- Preact can be used directly in the browser without any transpilation steps.
- Preact's tiny footprint means you can take the powerful Virtual DOM Component paradigm
  to new places.
- This library relies on a DOM environment being present.
- If you're using Jest it's already included and enabled by default.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Preact is packaged to be used directly in the browser, and doesn't require any build
  or tools.
- HTM is a JSX-like syntax that works in standard JavaScript.
- Vite has become an incredibly popular tool for building applications across many
  frameworks.
