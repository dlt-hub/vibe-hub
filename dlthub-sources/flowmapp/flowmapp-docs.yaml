notes:
- You must agree to the License Agreement to use the SDK.
- The SDK is provided 'as is' and 'as available' without warranty of any kind.
- The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in
  relation to your use of the SDK.
- You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
- The SDK is provided 'as is' without warranty of any kind.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
  non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK.
- The form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior notice
  to you.
- The obsession to provide best-in-class services to users is a vision that is shared
  between Jio and Google.
- Minimize data collection and only request necessary permissions.
- Libraries follow strict semantic versioning.
- Pre-release versions have a suffix that specifies the pre-release stage.
- Sign in to your developer account in Android Studio to access additional tools that
  require authentication
- Follow the prompts to provide the IDE with only the permissions required for each
  feature you want to enable
- Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content.
- Moving to any new language can be a daunting task.
- Start slow, move in chunks, and test frequently to align your team for success.
- Kotlin makes migrating easy, as it compiles down to JVM bytecode and is fully interoperable
  with Java.
- All source files must be encoded as UTF-8.
- Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits.
- Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words concatenated together.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This page focuses on creating DataStore in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects.
- 'Android Studio version: 3.2 Canary 10 or later'
- 'Android Gradle Plugin version: 3.2 or later'
- The SDK is provided 'AS IS' and 'AS AVAILABLE' without warranty of any kind from
  Google.
- The SDK is provided 'as is' and 'as available' without warranty of any kind from
  Google.
- The SDK is subject to United States export laws and regulations.
- You are solely responsible for any data, content, or resources that you create,
  transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android.
- View binding is enabled on a module-by-module basis.
- View binding replaces findViewById.
- The value for tools:viewBindingType must be a class that inherits from android.view.View.
- Xiaohongshu has organized the "Love and Share Your Accessible Lives" social event
  scheduled for October 15th, coinciding with White Cane Safety Day
- To minimize the risk of introducing new issues in a release, take a phased approach
  to testing and rollout, and monitor your metrics frequently during any changes.
- Users can be quick to leave feedback in the event of a poor experience, and might
  not update your app after first install.
- Be transparent, secure, and thorough in how you handle sensitive data.
- Respect your users' privacy and use resettable identifiers.
- In security, no solution or tactic can completely prevent fraud and theft.
- Financial apps are a top target for fraud because the transactions are valuable
  and easy to carry out.
- You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations
  that apply to the SDK.
- You are solely responsible for any data, content, or resources that you create,
  transmit or display through Android.
- Internal storage is always available on all devices, making it a more reliable place
  to put data on which your app depends.
- Scoped storage gives users more control over their files and limits file clutter,
  providing access only to the app-specific directory on external storage and specific
  types of media.
- Uses a single app architecture for both Android Auto and Android Automotive OS
- Make network requests on background threads to avoid blocking the main thread
- In tests, replace these dispatchers with instances of TestDispatchers.
- Inject Dispatchers when creating new coroutines or calling withContext.
- Suspend functions should be safe to call from the main thread.
- Views shouldn't directly trigger any coroutines to perform business logic.
- StateFlow is a hot flow—it remains in memory as long as the flow is collected or
  while any other references to it exist from a garbage collection root.
- '@Parcelize requires all serialized properties to be declared in the primary constructor.'
- The plugin issues a warning on each property with a backing field declared in the
  class body.
- You can't apply @Parcelize if some of the primary constructor parameters are not
  properties.
- 'If the project is minified or obfuscated then the following proguard rule must
  be included so that Room can find the generated implementation of the database definition:
  -keep class * extends androidx.room.RoomDatabase { <init>(); }'
- The recommended implementation to use is BundledSQLiteDriver available in androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled.
- Uses Kotlin extensions for app update and split install management.
- KMP projects follow a project structure similar to Android projects.
- The shared module uses Gradle as the build system just like the rest of the project.
- The module template automates the creation of a new module with the minimum configuration
  targeting Android and iOS platforms.
- Swift can't use Kotlin modules directly and requires a compiled binary framework
  to be produced.
- You can create the custom scope for projects or packages.
- The steps are the same.
- If you select the java folder and click Exclude Recursively, the green highlighting
  goes away on the java folder and all the folders and files under it.
- TVs are a natural home for a media player like VLC, so we knew there was a large
  community of people waiting to use the app on Android TV.
- Tinder was so pleased with their results with their Ads SDK that they're migrating
  their entire database layer to Room.
- CameraX simplifies configuration of attributes like resolution, aspect ratio, image
  rotation, capture quality.
- CameraX improves launch and capture performance on modern Android devices.
- Mir 2 improved Slow Session metric from 40% to 10% after integrating the Frame Pacing
  library.
- ODPM data is currently only available for Pixel 6 and higher devices.
- Adapting Lumen for Android required extensive modifications to UE5's rendering pipeline
  and shader compiler
- Optimizations were crucial to making ray tracing viable
- Netmarble adopted a data-driven approach to use ADPF, focusing on dynamic adjustments
  based on real-time thermal status.
- By focusing on resolution scaling and dynamic FPS adjustments guided by ADPF, Netmarble
  successfully mitigated overheating issues.
- ADPF is not fully supported by all Android-powered device manufacturers
- Thermal API is supported by most Android devices from Android 11 (API level 30),
  and Performance Hint API from Android 12 (API level 31).
- Improvements made to the Godot Vulkan renderer for performance.
- Dynamic UBO offset support added.
- Support for immutable samplers implemented.
- Android Adaptability and Unity Adaptive Performance are available to all Android
  game developers using the Unity Android provider on most Android devices after Android
  11 (API level 30), thermal, and Android 12 (API level 31), performance hint API.
- The process of getting a user from mobile web into a native app for the first time
  is an antiquated experience that is ripe for disruption.
- Uses ConstraintLayout to create complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy.
- The Layout Editor automatically adds constraints with Autoconnect and infer constraints
  features.
