In this guide, we'll set up a complete Column data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def column_financial_services_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.column.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "outgoing_transfer", "incoming_transfer", "return_request"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='column_financial_services_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='column_financial_services_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(column_financial_services_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from column_financial_services‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Transfers: Handles both incoming and outgoing real-time financial transfers, including international wires and ACH transactions. - Returns and Cancellations: Manages return requests and cancellations for various types of transfers. - Account Management: Facilitates the creation and management of bank accounts and associated transactions. - Payment Services: Includes endpoints for real-time payments, book transfers, and card program management. - Reporting: Provides detailed reports on bank account transactions and summaries.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Column workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@column_financial_services-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Column support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:column_financial_services duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@column_financial_services-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Column API, as specified in @column_financial_services-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "outgoing_transfer" and "incoming_transfer" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in column_financial_services_pipeline.py and name the pipeline column_financial_services_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python column_financial_services_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed via OAuth 2.0 with the need for a refresh token to maintain session validity. The API key is required for each request, passed through the header.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.column.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python column_financial_services_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline column_financial_services load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset column_financial_services_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/column_financial_services.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline column_financial_services_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("column_financial_services_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "outgoing_transfer" table as Pandas frame
   data."outgoing_transfer".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Users must be aware of the compliance requirements such as the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. All financial transactions like ACH and wire transfers must adhere to specific timelines and rules. Real-time transfer statuses are subject to change, and webhook configurations are necessary for receiving updates. Idempotency keys are used for safe retry mechanisms but expire after 30 days.
