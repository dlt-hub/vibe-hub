notes:
- Setting the LoginGraceTime to 0 makes your server safe from this vulnerability.
- Your version of OpenSSH will likely not be updated.
- The SFTP service for version 3.x of SFTP Gateway is located on port 22 by default.
- Make sure the port you change to is allowed access in your firewall rules.
- When configuring a Cloud Connection in the web admin portal, there's a Test Connection
  button.
- If not, you will need to troubleshoot your IAM permissions on the EC2 instance profile.
- If you deployed SFTP Gateway via our CloudFormation template, Instance Identity
  is already configured.
- Permissions to S3 are required for SFTP Gateway to function properly.
- Files that SFTP users upload will end up in the default S3 bucket specified during
  the setup process.
- Files will get transferred to S3 and will not remain in the uploads folder.
- WinSCP is only available for Windows machines.
- If the private key file extension is not .ppk, WinSCP will ask to convert the key.
- SFTP Gateway v3.x uses port 2222 for the SSH protocol
- When you connect over SSH, you need to override the default port
- The default SSH port is 22, so you need to explicitly set port 2222
- SSH port is 2222, SFTP service uses port 22.
- Port 22 is open to the world, because the SSH protocol is on port 2222.
- S3 objects are encrypted at the time of upload.
- A Cloud Connection defines a S3 Bucket destination and its related settings.
- The S3 bucket must be globally unique, lowercase, and fewer than 63 characters.
- 'Generate the key pair on the client side: The SFTP user should generate the key
  pair to ensure that the private key never leaves their system.'
- 'Share only the public key: The sftp user should send the public key to the sysadmin
  for configuration on the server. The private key should never be shared or transmitted
  over email.'
- 'Secure the private key: Store the private key in a secure location with restricted
  access. Use a passphrase to encrypt the private key for added security.'
- 'Use strong key types: Use modern key types like ed25519 or RSA 4096-bit for better
  security.'
- SFTP Gateway version 2 will reach EOL at the end of 2024.
- Tier 1 support is limited to the product itself.
- You must create a user and password (or SSH key) through the SFTP Gateway web admin
  interface.
- The web interface uses SSL to protect network traffic. But the SSL certificate is
  self-signed, so you will need to bypass this warning message.
- The API requires the credentials of a web admin user to obtain an OAuth token.
- No credentials are needed to call the /admin/config endpoint.
- Connecting via terminal only works for Mac or Linux, as Windows does not have a
  built-in sftp command.
- Username is required and must be unique.
- Home Directory specifies where the user will land when they connect.
- Tracking the number of files uploaded to an SFTP server can be useful for monitoring
  activity, detecting anomalies, or generating reports.
- Always make a backup of your original SSH key before modifying it.
- Files are encrypted in transit and at rest at all stages, beginning with the SFTP
  client and ending with S3.
- SFTP users are chrooted by default into '/users/username/' in the default cloud
  connection.
- 'Passwords must adhere to SFTP Gateway''s password policy: At least 8 characters,
  Mixed case, At least 1 special character.'
- The SSH protocol has been moved to TCP port '2222'.
- The web ports TCP '80' and '443' should also be locked down to the IP address range
  of the system administrator.
- Monitoring authentication failures in SFTP can help identify security risks, misconfigurations,
  and unauthorized access attempts.
- Provides a convenient way to manage users, folders, and system settings.
- Requires SSH private key or password associated with the username
- SFTP Gateway users are not limited to a single key pair for authentication.
- A user account can hold many public keys, both previously existing and newly generated
  within the application.
- For SFTP Gateway version 2.0, please use the Getting Started with SFTP Gateway 2.0
  guide.
- To allow all IP traffic, use `0.0.0.0/0`.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in SFTP Gateway
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'User Activity: If you need to track which user uploaded the file, include user
  metadata in your query.'
- 'Exporting Logs: You can export search results for further analysis using AWS S3,
  AWS Lambda, or Amazon OpenSearch Service.'
- 'Alerts & Notifications: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you when a file matching
  specific criteria is uploaded.'
- Keep an eye on the web browser status.
- You could be seeing prior results if the Test Connection attempt hangs.
- Tracking file uploads by a specific user in SFTP logs can help monitor activity
  and troubleshoot issues.
- SFTP Gateway version 3.x uses a CloudFormation parameter named `BucketAccess`, which
  can be either `Restricted` (default) or `Open`.
- SFTP users cannot access other users' folders by default.
- Folder permissions default to Read/Write, but you can change this to Read Only or
  Write Only.
- Amazon Cognito cannot be used for SFTP User authentication.
- Ensure to replace placeholders in Issuer URI with actual values.
- By default, only the PARANOID and STRONG algorithms will be allowed.
- Command Mode is used for navigation and executing commands
- Insert Mode is used for typing text
- Boolean values are case-sensitive and should be lowercase (true or false).
- Time values are specified in their respective units as indicated in the descriptions.
- Path references should use forward slashes, even on Windows systems.
- Changes to these properties require a service restart to take effect.
- When setting the password of another admin user, you must use a one-time password.
- The given password must adhere to the Password Policy defined throughout the application.
- The changed password cannot be the same as the assigned one-time password.
- Nginx configuration can result in the disclosure of the private IP address.
- The Log4j yum package has been removed in version 3.001.01.
- SFTP Gateway uses logback for logging purposes.
- SFTP Gateway does not include log4j-core, because it does not use log4j.
- This vulnerability affects all versions of SFTP Gateway prior to v3.4.6
- SFTP clients (e.g. FileZilla and WinSCP) should also be updated to make sure you
  are negotiating the latest MACs, ciphers, and key exchange algorithms
- Anyone using SFTP Gateway or stand alone OpenSSH should lock down vulnerable ciphers
  and HMACS
- 'There are three security levels: PARANOID, STRONG, and WEAK. Our system defaults
  to STRONG.'
- 'To change the security level, edit the file: /opt/sftpgw/application.properties
  and set the security-level property.'
- If a user attempts to login with invalid credentials from the same ip address after
  10 failed attempts, they will be locked for an hour.
- The SFTP system will ban an IP address for 5 hours if it has made more than 10 failed
  authentication attempts within 5 minutes of each other.
- The Memory Settings were changed in version 3.5.0 of SFTP Gateway.
- Make sure to follow the instructions for your version of SFTP Gateway or the application
  (Java) may fail when restarted.
- The OpenSSH service for version 3.x of SFTP Gateway is located on port 2222 by default.
- You can override the default password policy for SFTP users.
- To apply your changes, restart the Java service.
- Ensure OpenSSH is updated to a patched version
- Log into the SFTP Gateway admin interface and navigate to Security Settings to disable
  insecure algorithms
- Make sure you are subscribed to SFTP Gateway Professional in the AWS Marketplace.
- Get your workstation's public IP from checkip.dyndns.org.
- By default, the IP allowlist is empty, so there are no restrictions. But restrictions
  begin as soon as you add an IP address range to the list.
- Choose 'open' for Bucket Access to allow access to all S3 buckets.
- Defaults for EC2 Type is 't3.medium', but 'm5.large' is recommended for production.
- Stack creation requires acknowledgment of IAM resource creation.
- Choose 'open' bucket access to allow access to all S3 buckets.
- Defaults are set for EC2 Type, Disk Volume Size, Desired Capacity, and DB Class.
- Always restrict critical management ports (2222, 80, 443) to trusted IP ranges.
- Enable key-based authentication for all SFTP users.
- Regularly review SFTP logs and update per-user IP allow-lists for improved access
  control.
- Utilize built-in brute force protection to mitigate dictionary-based authentication
  attacks.
- SSH protocol has been moved from the default port 22 to 2222.
- The Java service implemented on port 22 denies the SSH protocol.
- SFTP Gateway 3.x relies on the web admin portal to configure SFTP users and settings.
- When deployed into a private subnet, you need to use AWS System Manager Session
  Manager to connect your local machine's browser directly to the private EC2 instance.
- The SFTP banner is bundled into the SFTP Gateway Java Jar file.
- SSH into your VM using port `2222`.
- 'Run the command to elevate your privileges: sudo su.'
- 'Create a new text file containing your SFTP banner message: /opt/sftpgw/banner.txt.'
- 'Edit the file: /opt/sftpgw/application.properties.'
- 'Add the line: sftp.banner-path=file:banner.txt.'
- 'Restart Java to apply your change: service sftpgw-admin-api restart.'
- The error message may reappear multiple times, but the file will upload eventually.
- This error only happens with WinSCP, and does not happen with FileZilla or the SFTP
  command line.
- The problem is that WinSCP is unable to list the chroot directory if there is a
  subfolder that is backed by an SFTP Gateway Folder object.
- SFTP users will encounter errors when trying to upload files.
- Files uploaded via SFTP Gateway show normal timestamps.
- Our code is missing a step to set the Content Type back to its original value.
- Recommended to use instance profile credentials, but unique credentials can be used.
- This issue has been resolved in version 3.001.00.
- This method is only used for Single Instances that have no UserData content.
- If you're in an HA setup with an AutoScaling Group, you can use SSM to inject new
  credentials or contact us at support@thorntech.com for assistance.
- Internal manager has read/write access to the /users/ directory and everything nested
  within.
- Deleting a Folder only deletes the mapping -- it does not delete the underlying
  objects in S3.
- The folder will not appear in S3 until you have logged in as the SFTP user.
- AWS RDS SSL certificates periodically expire and need to be updated.
- 'You receive an email from AWS with the subject line: [Action required] Update Your
  Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora SSL/TLS Certificates by August 22, 2024.'
- It advises you to make sure to update any database client software relying on the
  SSL cert.
- It also recommends that you update the Certificate Authority to rds-ca-rsa2048-g1.
- SFTP Gateway v3 is not affected by changing the Certificate Authority from rds-ca-2019
  to rds-ca-rsa2048-g1.
- The log files within /opt/sftpgw/log/ have a retention of 30 days, or 3 GB (whichever
  of these comes first).
- It's often helpful to tail a log file while troubleshooting, to get a sense of timing.
- Each SFTP user is chrooted in their respective folder and cannot traverse to the
  parent users directory.
- Any files dropped into the chroot directory will be stored in their own user folder
  on the default Cloud Connection.
- In some environments, you might need to configure a proxy in front of the SFTP Gateway
  EC2 instance.
- Disabling the IP banning feature may be necessary to prevent blocking the proxy's
  IP address.
- Initialized from configuration properties.
- There is currently an error on version 3.2.1 & 3.3.2 involving WinSCP and the creation
  of Folder objects under your chroot directory.
- This error only affects the WinSCP client -- other clients such as FileZilla are
  not affected.
- This issue has been resolved in version 3.003.03.
- You will receive this error message due to a password policy in the /etc/login.defs
  file, which requires you to reset your password every 365 days.
- 'To get past the error message and connect to server, edit the SSH config file and
  append the line: PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa'
- Alternatively, add the flag -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=ssh-rsa in the sftp command.
- SFTP Gateway v3 does not allow ssh-rsa for server host keys by default.
- Ensure RSA and DSS are checked in the fingerprint section of the SFTP connection.
- Replace all placeholder variables in the script with values specific to your environment.
- Recommended EBS volume size is 30 GB.
- In SFTP Gateway v3.7.0, IAM authentication must be disabled for in-place upgrades
  from v3.5.1.
- Our recommended approach to cycling in new EC2 instances is to use a combination
  of Warm Pools and using the ASG Detach feature.
- These two techniques used together will eliminate downtime as you update your stack.
- The upgrade process described above is fairly cautious, with opportunity to verify
  things along the way.
- Use t3.medium for testing, but m5.large is recommended for Production.
- Public IP address range for SFTP access defaults to being open to the public (0.0.0.0/0).
- If you deployed SFTP Gateway using CloudFormation from the AWS marketplace, you
  should have CloudWatch automatically connected to your instance.
- This bug only applies to SFTP Gateway version 3.2.1
- SFTP Gateway does not have an in-place upgrade process. Rather, you will need to
  spin up an additional CloudFormation stack for the new version, and migrate your
  users and settings as well as other resources you would like to keep.
- To retain the original Elastic IP, you need to use a CloudFormation DeletionPolicy.
- Make sure to edit the script on line 59 for the endpoint of generating the OAuth
  token.
- The best approach is to just wait. The error message may reappear multiple times,
  but the file will upload eventually.
- There are issues with the S3 encryption types under the AWS Cloud Connection.
- Files stored on S3 are still encrypted at rest.
- Custom applications trying to access files on S3 will need to specify signature
  version 4 when making API calls to AWS S3.
- Files made publicly available on S3 cannot be accessed due to the signature version
  4 requirement.
- The Java backend is running into an issue recognizing the No Encryption type.
- Uses LetsEncrypt for free SSL certificate, requires renewal every few months.
- Paid SSL certificate (e.g. GoDaddy) lasts for one year.
- This cert is not a Trusted CA Signed SSL certificate, so web browsers will not consider
  the website certificate to be valid.
- You will still see warning messages that the certificate is Not Trusted when navigating
  to the Web Admin UI.
- If you would like to install a valid certificate you can use GoDaddy.
- If you're on version 3.5.0 or newer of SFTP Gateway, make sure to edit the script
  on line 69 so the endpoint for generating the OAuth token is set to http://127.0.0.1:8080/login.
- Ensure that the SSM Agent is installed and running on the EC2 instance.
- Ensure your EC2 instance has an IAM role with AmazonSSMFullAccess policy attached.
- 'IMPORTANT: Ensure to set the endpoint for generating the OAuth token to ''http://127.0.0.1:8080/login''
  for version 3.5.0 or newer.'
- Make sure to edit the script on line 119 to set the endpoint for generating the
  OAuth token.
- Make this change in two locations.
- The LetsEncrypt SSL certificate only lasts 90 days, so it requires periodic renewal.
- To fix the Liquibase lock error, connect to the Postgresql database and manually
  delete the lock.
- For security purposes, lock the database after exiting.
- This bug only affects some SFTP users and can only happen in certain conditions.
- This bug is caching related, so you may not encounter any issues.
- This is a temporary workaround until you are able to update to v3.7.2
- There is currently an error in version 3.x of SFTP Gateway where folders set to
  inherited in the SFTP Gateway folders tab may potentially bleed into the parent
  directory and are also inaccessible from this view.
- The solution is to remove any inherited folders under that user's Home Directory.
  Any folders should instead be created via SFTP or from S3.
- The inherited folders are only necessary if you're assigning special permissions
  such as read-only or if you're mapping to a different cloud location.
- Uses SFTP Gateway Professional, which supports up to 100 SFTP users.
- The recommended EBS volume size for SFTP Gateway is 30 GB.
- In order to run the in-place upgrade script you must be on version 3.006.00 or later
  due to the introduction of application license files in our build process.
- Our recommended approach for upgrading to a new version of SFTP Gateway is to spin
  up a new SFTP Gateway instance and import your Users & Settings into the new instance
  using a Backup file.
- 'Usage: sudo backup-script.sh -u admin -p password'
- To avoid password in bash history, use a credential file.
- Select different vpc options while keeping an eye on the Subnet Settings below.
- It doesn't matter which subnet you choose, since all subnets within the default
  vpc are public.
- When migrating from SFTP Gateway v2 to v3, the server host keys on v3 must match
  those on v2 to avoid security warnings.
- The server host keys on v3 are located in /opt/sftpgw/
