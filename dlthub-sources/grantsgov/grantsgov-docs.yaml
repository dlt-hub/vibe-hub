notes:
- Grantors need to support the latest versions of these Forms.
- Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov.
- Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program
  will be considered late and will not be considered for funding.
- The primary endpoint, v1/api/search2, is designed to be accessible without user
  authentication.
- Expected request body should include 'opportunityId'.
- Grants.gov requires the Applicant organizations to hash each submission attachment
  in order to ensure proper delivery of the submission to the agency.
- As of June 16, 2018 with Release 16.2.1, the Submission Hash will no longer be validated
  for either submission header version (V1.0 and V2.0). There are no changes to the
  attachment hash processing.
- Grants.gov uses the SHA-1 for computing hash values. The resulting hash value shall
  be encoded using the Base64 data encoding specification.
- When creating the attachment XML, it is important to specify 'SHA-1' in the Global
  Schema 'glob:hashAlgorithm' attribute. If a value other than SHA-1 is received in
  the XML, Grants.gov will reject the application.
- CID values must be unique across the entire submission XML.
- The XPath to each attachment FileName element must be unique across the entire submission
  XML.
- Each client will receive an encrypted API key, which needs to be set in the Authorization
  Header.
- A separate API key is required for each environment (i.e. Production, Training).
errors:
- 'Bad Request: You do not have a system role with the Create Workspace privilege.'
- 'ERROR 404: Page Not Found'
- 'ERROR 500: Internal Server Error'
- 'Failed to Save Attachment: Check that you have properly saved all of your application
  package''s supporting documents.'
- 'Closing Date of the Grant Opportunity Passed: The deadline has passed for the opportunity
  for which you have applied.'
- 'Mandatory Forms Not Found: All mandatory forms and fields are not complete in your
  application package.'
- 'Authorized Organization Representatives Only: Your Grants.gov username may not
  be authorized to submit applications on behalf of your organization.'
- Applications received late will not be considered for funding.
- '200: OK: Everything worked as expected'
- '400: Bad Request: The request was unacceptable. This is often due to missing a
  required parameter.'
- '401: Unauthorized: No valid API key was provided.'
- '402: Request Failed: The parameters were valid, but the request failed.'
- '403: Forbidden: The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.'
- '404: Not Found: The requested resource doesn’t exist.'
- '429: Too Many Requests: Too many of the user’s requests hit the API too quickly.
  We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.'
- '500, 502, 503, 504: Server Errors: Something went wrong on Grants.gov''s end.'
