notes:
- Implementing email validation with React Hook Form can help achieve a clean, active
  contact list, ensure data security, and provide a great user experience.
- Using React Hook Form for client-side validation to improve user experience and
  provide immediate feedback.
- Implement server-side validation to ensure data accuracy and security, using dedicated
  APIs, such as the Abstract API email validator.
- Normalise and sanitize inputs before sending them to the API for further validation.
- Provide clear and informative error messages to users.
- Handle API errors gracefully, wrapping API calls in try/catch.
- API provides a CSV upload for bulk queries.
- Backed by bank-level security via API keys.
- Klazify offers a free 7-day trial.
- Plans start at $39.99/month for 500 API requests, and range up to $3950/month for
  over a million API calls.
- Email validation APIs perform deep checks, including syntax validation, MX record
  lookups, and SMTP verification.
- Vue dev server runs on port 5173
- Generous free tier
- Good documentation and tutorials
- CSV upload for bulk queries
- Structuring API resources ensures that only necessary information is sent to the
  client, minimizing the risk of data exposure.
- Pagination helps structure your API resources more effectively.
- Expanded support to allow content capture of password-protected websites
- Enhanced error handling for batch processing requests, with detailed error reporting,
  standardized error codes, and automatic retries for failed tasks

- Structured exception handling is a critical component of building resilient applications.
- Using @ControllerAdvice for global exception handling offers several advantages
  including centralized error logic and consistent API responses.
- API security is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms is crucial for protecting
  APIs from security threats.
- Flask-JWT-Extended handles authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens
  (JWTs).
- API keys are unique identifiers assigned to each client of an API.
- It's advisable to hash the API key before storing it to mitigate security risks.
- The client must include the JWT token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>
  with every subsequent request.
- Token revocation strategies include blacklisting revoked tokens, setting short expiration
  times, and issuing refresh tokens.
- Uses Marshmallow for data serialization and validation
- Validates input data to ensure correctness before further processing
- Errors are inevitable— they are just part of the development process.
- Always issue error messages in a JSON format.
- It’s generally recommended to prioritize JSON, as it is widely used in REST APIs.
- Use Flask’s errorhandler decorator to register custom error handlers.
- 'To run the API locally, use: docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-api-abstract'
- 'To run your Flask API in staging mode: docker run -p 5000:5000 --env FLASK_ENV=staging
  flask-api-abstract'
- 'To run your Flask API in production mode: docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env FLASK_ENV=production
  flask-api-abstract'

  your campaigns effective.
- 'The local part can include a specific range of characters, commonly: Alphabet letters
  (A–Z, a–z) and numerals (0–9), some special characters like: Period (.), Underscore
  (_), Hyphen (-), Plus sign (+).'
- The local part cannot begin or end with a period (.) and cannot have consecutive
  periods.
- According to email standards, the local part can be up to 64 characters long.
- 'Domain names can include: Alphabetic characters (A–Z, case-insensitive), Digits
  (0–9), Hyphens (-), Dots (.) to separate subdomains and the TLD.'
- The domain must contain at least one dot to separate the name from the TLD.
- The full domain string can be up to 255 characters long.
- Domain names are not case-sensitive.
- Use APIs to automate email filtering during sign-up, contact forms, or email list
  cleanup.
- This regex allows Latin characters, digits, hyphens, and IP address literals for
  email validation.
- The regex does not allow Unicode characters and does not check for the entire length
  of the email address.
- Using regular expressions for email validation can lead to high CPU loads and potential
  ReDoS attacks.
- Maintaining regex for email validation can be inconvenient due to changing standards.
- API checks syntax, domain validity, MX records, and verifies SMTP servers.
- Supports bulk email validation by uploading a CSV file.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Real-time validation checks an address as soon as it is entered.
- Integrate real-time validation directly into sign-up forms and check-out pages.
- Implement real-time email validation in your web forms.

  can also run on macOS and Windows, making it suitable for developers on different
  operating systems.'
- LAMP is perfect for straightforward use cases such as blogs, landing pages, personal
  portfolios, or small business sites.
- Many older systems—especially internal tools and early-generation content platforms—were
  built on LAMP.
- Content Management Systems like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are deeply rooted
  in the LAMP ecosystem.
- LAMP’s low barrier to entry and extensive documentation make it an ideal choice
  for quickly developing and testing ideas.
- LAMP is entirely open-source and can be hosted on low-cost virtual private servers.
- For teams or organizations that prefer self-hosting due to privacy, data control,
  or compliance requirements, LAMP offers a reliable and fully customizable stack.
- APIs are great at building modular solutions, but they need to be tested often to
  ensure they're operating correctly.
- Query parameters are parameters attached to the end of a URL and separated from
  the URL by a question mark.
- Path parameters are part of the endpoint and are required.
- Query parameters are optional.
- A cache is a place in a network where frequently accessed data can be stored to
  improve load times.
- Optimizing the network using caching improves the overall quality-of-service by
  reducing bandwidth, latency, and load on servers.
- Cache busting changes the URI to retrieve fresh resources.
