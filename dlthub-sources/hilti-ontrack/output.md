In this guide, we'll set up a complete Hilti data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def hilti_management_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://your-instance.api-name.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "assets",
            "manufacturers",
            "documents"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='hilti_management_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='hilti_management_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(hilti_management_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from hilti_management‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Asset Management: Includes endpoints for managing assets, such as listing, assigning, and updating asset details.
- Document Management: Manages documents related to assets, including uploading documents and retrieving presigned URLs for document access.
- Service History Management: Tracks and manages service history and runtime data for assets, allowing updates and retrieval of historical data.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Hilti workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@hilti_management-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Hilti support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:hilti_management duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@hilti_management-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Hilti API, as specified in @hilti_management-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "assets" and "manufacturers" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in hilti_management_pipeline.py and name the pipeline hilti_management_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python hilti_management_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is handled using OAuth2. A token must be obtained and used in API requests. The token is valid for 60 minutes and must be refreshed after that interval. Secure handling of client credentials and tokens is mandatory.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.hilti.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python hilti_management_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline hilti_management load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset hilti_management_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/hilti_management.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline hilti_management_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("hilti_management_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "assets" table as Pandas frame
   data."assets".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

The API token expires every 60 minutes, requiring re-authentication. Strict security measures must be adhered to when handling tokens and credentials. The API is only available to On!Track Pro customers with specific purchases. Usage rights are terminated upon agreement termination, and Hilti may conduct audits.
