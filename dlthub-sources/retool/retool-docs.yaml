notes:
- Retool only evaluates a page's objects when the page is currently in view.
- Globally scoped objects can be referenced across multiple pages.
- The API token must have the 'Workflows > Read' scope.
- The API token must have the 'Users > Read' scope.
- Agents can be triggered via Chat (default) and also via Email.
- An agent requires a tool, or a set of tools, to work with.
