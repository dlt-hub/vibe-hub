In this guide, we'll set up a complete Twitch data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def twitch_integration_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.twitch.tv/helix/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "clips",
            "chat/messages",
            "moderation/moderators"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='twitch_integration_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='twitch_integration_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(twitch_integration_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from twitch_integration‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Clips Management: Create and retrieve clips from Twitch broadcasts.
- Chat Interaction: Send messages and announcements in Twitch chat.
- Moderation: Manage moderators, automod settings, and user bans.
- Analytics: Access analytical data for games and extensions.
- User Management: Retrieve user information and manage user settings.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Twitch workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@twitch_integration-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Twitch support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:twitch_integration duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@twitch_integration-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Twitch API, as specified in @twitch_integration-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "clips" and "chat/messages" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in twitch_integration_pipeline.py and name the pipeline twitch_integration_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python twitch_integration_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Twitch uses OAuth2 for authentication. Client credentials and user access tokens are required, depending on the endpoint. Tokens must include specific scopes relevant to the requested actions.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.twitch.tv/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python twitch_integration_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline twitch_integration load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset twitch_integration_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/twitch_integration.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline twitch_integration_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("twitch_integration_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "clips" table as Pandas frame
   data."clips".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Rate limits apply, and tokens expire requiring careful management. Certain features are in beta and may change. Compliance with content security policies is crucial for Extensions. OAuth scopes must be correctly configured. Verification processes for bots and apps can be intricate.
