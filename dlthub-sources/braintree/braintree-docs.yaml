notes:
- PayPal APIs use REST, authenticate with OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
- Requires OAuth2 setup with proper credentials.
- Ensure to handle different response codes for error management.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Yes, the single-use token that is returned on the client can be saved to the vault
  prior to creating a transaction on your server.
- Be aware that we only support saving when using the store_in_save_on_success boolean
  in the transaction.sale() request.
- Fastlane does not support a flow where a customer or payment_method is created prior
  to a transaction.
- 'Let your payers know that PayPal is processing the payment using one of the following
  options: At checkout, include this text and link to the PayPal privacy notice: ''By
  paying with your card, you acknowledge that your data will be processed by PayPal
  subject to the PayPal Privacy Statement available at PayPal.com.'''
- 'Before payment, include this in your privacy notice: ''We use PayPal for payments

- PayPal Card Fields is a PCI DSS service provider. Use the Card Fields integration
  to comply with PCI compliance when collecting card information from buyers.
- Use sandbox for testing before going live.
- Replace sandbox data with live data for production.
- DropZone as a client is the preferred integration option and may require fewer consultations
  with PayPal.
- Files delivered to your storage system over DropZone are encrypted. You'll need
  to decrypt these files.
