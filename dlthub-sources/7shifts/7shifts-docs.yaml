- The user modified endpoint doesn't provide details on who modified the user and
  what was modified to track this.
- Webhooks are restricted to Gourmet plans.
- This webhook will be triggered when a user is deactivated.
- Access tokens provide admin level access, are long lived, and are simple to implement.
- Bearer authentication scheme is used to send the token.

- Stable versions are supported for a minimum of 12 months and will include security
  updates only.

- It is recommended to always include a location_id to minimize the number of locations
  in the report.
- If you still receive a time out error, it is recommended to shorten the report period
  to a single week.
- You will require an HTTP endpoint that can accept unauthenticated webhook requests
  with a POST method.
- Webhooks configured by 7shifts may include header information to help you determine
  which event and event they are for.
- Plan RestrictedCompany level webhooks require a Gourmet plan or higher.
- It is recommend that before you add a webhook your application receiving the notification
  is functional.
- Delays or timeouts can result in delayed delivery of subsequent webhooks.

- Integration should calculate hours worked excluding unpaid breaks.
- Admin should have option to include/exclude breaks for payroll processing.
- Bearer tokens expire after 1 hour.
- To confirm your access token is valid, use the test endpoint.
- You may only make 10 requests per second per Access Token across all API endpoints.
- Receipt creation is asynchronous and may take up to 5 minutes before a receipt can
  be updated.
- The request URL requires you to specify the ext prefix and location ID when using
  your systems receipt id.
- We currently don't support deleting a receipt, so a PUT request is used to set the
  receipt total to 0 and receipt status to voided or deleted.
- This service must only be called between 08:00:00 UTC and 15:00:00 UTC following
  the integration being set up and a location being mapped.
- Please do not make more than 10 requests per second per token.
- This tactic should only be used for the historical data push, and not with regular
  receipts being sent over to 7shifts.
- Interval overrides are only available in V1 endpoints.
- The broader the time intervals, hourly or daily, the less accurate the Optimal Labor
  Tool forecasts will be.
- The optional parameters are currently not supported in tip pools.
- Mapping status is unmapped or ignored when the employee’s profile isn’t correctly
  mapped to a 7shifts user_id.
- You may only make 10 requests per second per access token across all API endpoints
- You must create time punch data in 7shifts in near-real time for clients to be able
  to use the labor integration to its full extent
- Ensure correct 'department_id' & 'location_id' associated with the 'role_id'.
- The 'date' & 'clocked_in' fields should have the same values used in the original
  POST request to create the punch.
- Employees should not be allowed to start another break if they haven’t returned
  from their previous break yet.
- You may only make 10 requests per second per access token across all API endpoints.
- You must make these requests in real-time at the time a user tries to clock-in.
- The grace period must be specified as a URL parameter in every request.
- The grace period cannot be defined any higher than 60 minutes.
- You must implement role mapping & employee mapping to implement the following integration.
- You may also want to allow the admin/manager in your system to decide whether to
  prevent late clock-ins or not.
- Use the `deleted=true` query filter to retrieve deleted shifts.
- Use the `draft=true` query filter to retrieve unpublished shifts.
- Do not combine the `deleted=true` and `draft=true` query filters in a single request.
- Only profiles with the 7shifts user type Employee can be created.
- The default limit is 100 users with a maximum of 500
