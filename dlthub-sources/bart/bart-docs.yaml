notes:
- Updated API version from 1.01 to 2.0.
- The "fare" and "clipper" attributes of the <trip> element are deprecated, and the
  <fares> element should be used instead.
- Trips can contain from 1 to 4 legs, depending on the number of transfers that are
  required.
- Fare classes may change, but should always include a "cash" fare along with any
  other discount classes.
- The Fare "name" attribute is the official BART name for the fare and should be used
  when displaying the fare.
- The "level" attribute of the <fares> element is for future use and will currently
  always have a value of "normal".
- Special schedule messages will only be displayed if the trip date, time, and orig
  or dest stations match a special schedule notice.
- Any error messages will be included in an <error> item under the <message> element.
- The 'fare' and 'clipper' attributes of the <trip> element are deprecated, and the
  <fares> element should be used instead.
- Trips can contain from 1 to 3 legs, depending on the number of transfers that are
  required.
- Fare clases may change, but should always include a 'cash' fare along with any other
  discount classes.
- The Fare 'name' attribute is the official BART name for the fare and should be used
  when displaying the fare.
- The 'level' attribute of the <fares> element is for future use and will currently
  always have a value of 'normal'.
- The abbreviation ASBY for Ashby is also accepted for backwards compatibility with
  the BART GTFS feed. This is a deprecated abbreviation and should not be used for
  current and future development.
- The default format for API output is XML.
- In order to provide the JSON output, BART converts the standard XML output into
  JSON.
- The JSON output format can be specified for any call by adding '&json=y' to any
  API call.
- Route Information sometimes changes with schedule changes as lines are reconfigured.
- The optional 'date' and 'sched' parameters should not be used together. If they
  are, the date will be ignored, and the sched parameter will be used.
- This information is primarily useful when a new schedule has been announced and
  released.
- The load factor command takes from 1 to 3 ld parameters, each representing the start
  of a trip leg.
