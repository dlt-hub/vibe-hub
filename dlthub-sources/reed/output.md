In this guide, we'll set up a complete Reed Recruiter data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def reed_recruiter_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://www.reed.co.uk/recruiter/api/1.0/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "api_key",
                "key": 'Authorization',
                "value": 'ApiKey ' + access_token
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "job_posting",
            "jobs",
            "job_search"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='reed_recruiter_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='reed_recruiter_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(reed_recruiter_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from reed_recruiter‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Job Posting: Allows for the creation and management of job listings.
- Job Management: Search and retrieve detailed information about specific job postings.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Reed Recruiter workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@reed_recruiter-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Reed Recruiter support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:reed_recruiter duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@reed_recruiter-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Reed Recruiter API, as specified in @reed_recruiter-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "job_posting" and "jobs" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in reed_recruiter_pipeline.py and name the pipeline reed_recruiter_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python reed_recruiter_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done via an API key included in the request header.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.reed.co.uk/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python reed_recruiter_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline reed_recruiter load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset reed_recruiter_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/reed_recruiter.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline reed_recruiter_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("reed_recruiter_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "job_posting" table as Pandas frame
   data."job_posting".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure using 'https://' for all requests to comply with SSL standards. All text fields must comply with specific character limits and content restrictions, such as no inclusion of URLs, email addresses, or phone numbers. Jobs can only be relisted within 4 days of their expiry. API key and Client ID must always be provided and validated.
