notes:
- Be careful! This will override all entity values with the new ones including the
  fact that none provided values will get default values.
- Polling servers is something you should avoid at much as possible. It's good for
  nobody. It consumes precious resources unnecessarily.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- The URL for webhooks must be public and accessible from Altoviz servers.
- API are protected by a rate limit of 100 calls per minute.
- If you reach this limitation, you will get an HTTP code 429 'Too many requests.
  Please try again later'.
- You can get the next opportunity time evaluation in the 'retry-after' header in
  milliseconds.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Not Found
- '200'
- '404'
