- Transaction charges are non-refundable.
- Vague reasons like 'The app is not up to the mark' cannot be considered a valid
  reason for providing refunds.

  in spam, or you will face deliverability issues.
- Ideally, if you use free email accounts, you will keep facing deliverability issues.
  Hence, we don't recommend using the same to get more deals.
- Ensure that you don't use more than 3 - 4 email accounts under one domain as having
  more than this, there is a chance that your email account can get blacklisted.
- Setting these records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) is not applicable if you use a free email
  account like gmail.com, outlook.com, or yahoo.com.

- DNS changes may take up to 48 hours to fully propagate.
- Saleshandy Default Fields can't be changed.
