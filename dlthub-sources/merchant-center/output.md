In this guide, we'll set up a complete Google Shopping Content data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def google_shopping_content_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://shoppingcontent.googleapis.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "collections",
            "products",
            "accountstatuses"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='google_shopping_content_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='google_shopping_content_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(google_shopping_content_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from google_shopping_content‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Omnichannel Settings: Access omnichannel settings for your merchant account.
- LfpProviders: Retrieve loyalty and funding program providers.
- GbpAccounts: Manage Google Business Profile accounts.
- OnlineReturnPolicy: Access and modify return policies for online products.
- Collections: Create or manage collections of products.
- Collection Statuses: Check the status of specific collections.
- Products: Create or update product listings, manage inventory.
- Account Statuses: View or update the status of merchant accounts.
- Free Listing Program: Manage settings and review requests for free listing programs.
- Order Tracking: Send signals for order tracking to improve customer service.
- Regional Settings: Manage regional settings and inventories for specific areas.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Google Shopping Content workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@google_shopping_content-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Google Shopping Content support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:google_shopping_content duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@google_shopping_content-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Google Shopping Content API, as specified in @google_shopping_content-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "collections" and "products" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in google_shopping_content_pipeline.py and name the pipeline google_shopping_content_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python google_shopping_content_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    OAuth 2.0 with refresh token flow is used for authentication.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://developers.google.com/shopping-content.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python google_shopping_content_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline google_shopping_content load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset google_shopping_content_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/google_shopping_content.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline google_shopping_content_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("google_shopping_content_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "collections" table as Pandas frame
   data."collections".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Be aware of strict API quotas and limits, which can change without notice. Compliance with Shopping ads and free listings policies is mandatory. There are specific conditions and policies for account status and products that could lead to account suspension. Make sure to handle errors and warnings properly as they can affect account and product status significantly. The API recommends using client libraries for enhanced security and simplified coding.
