# Known Quirks or Risks, Caveats
notes:
  - The Timestamp, Thing and Id columns are mandatory for the Connector to work as intended.
  - Incremental syncs might not work properly if the Timestamp column is not in the first position.

# Troubleshooting & Error Patterns
errors:
  - REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency
  - 401 Unauthorized: Recheck API Access Token validity or permissions
