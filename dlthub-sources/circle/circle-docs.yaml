notes:
- MAU is the number of unique users that create or consume content on Circle servers
  through SDK or API within a monthly billing cycle.
- All service requests except authentication are counted as MAU.
- Authentication endpoints are not taken into account, so you can use them without
  increasing your MAU count.
- Use token type 'Headless Auth' for it to work with the Auth APIs.
- The admin API is not meant to be used on the client side, or to re-create your own
  Circle experience from scratch.
- After October 2024, we strongly recommend using the admin API v2 whenever possible.
- Requests are admin-authenticated, which means the API can only be used to build
  administrative tooling and automations.
- Requests are member-authenticated via the member-specific JWT tokens.
- SGID is crucial for identifying elements within a block.
- All content must be wrapped in a paragraph node
- Links require both href and target attributes
- Mentions require a valid SGID
- Attachments must be uploaded separately first to obtain signed IDs
- Line breaks can be added between any content nodes using hardBreak type
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
