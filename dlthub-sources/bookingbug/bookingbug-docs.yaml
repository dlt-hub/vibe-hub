- Resources are not copied down, you can re-create the resources at the new child
  company.
- Timezone is assigned as the parent company's timezone, unless specified otherwise.
- The updates are not immediate, they trigger a background task to process the updates.
- There is a maximum of 4000 objects per API call.
- The Import API can be used to create or update a number of entities in bulk.
- GET API calls for retrieving data use pagination (page and per_page parameters)
  to ensure performance of the API responses.

- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ensure you include and correctly set the Expiry Date and Time when creating the

- Auth-Token issued on the POST Baskets call ensures the booking channel is set to
  'Client'.
- Auth-Token is typically valid for 15 minutes but is configurable.
- The Auth-Token is generated when the login end-point is executed and must be included
  in the header for every call.
- It is possible to cache the returned auth-token for later use.
- Access token will be valid for 2 hours
- 401 Authorisation errors will be returned if the Access Token has expired
- The below steps assume that Booking Questions and Booking Question Groups have already
  been created
- Payload includes all the appointment information.
- You must be logged in as this client to update their details via the public API.
- It is best practice to use a single date however if a range of dates is required,
  it is best practice to limit the date range for this call to a maximum of a 5 day
  date range to ensure that the API response is received efficiently.
