notes:
- This endpoint can be used to verify the INSTANCE_API_SECRET to be correct.
- Make sure that there are payment provider activated in your Payrexx account which
  support preauthorizations.
- The amount is reserved for 2-3 working days and the possibility to debit the amount
  is guaranteed.
- Payment has been processed in sandbox
- For Tokenization, pass 'preAuthorization=1' along with Gateway creation request.
- For Reservation, pass 'reservation=1'.
- The server needs to send a response within 20 seconds. Otherwise, the request times
  out.
- You can pass GET parameters in the url to predefine the field values.
- The IFrame is not allowed to make redirections on your site, therefore you need
  to execute this redirection yourself
- 'To ensure fair use of resources and maintain service quality, Payrexx enforces
  an API rate limit on all requests: 600 requests per 5 minutes - Enforced by AWS
  WAF'
- If the rate limit is exceeded, you will first encounter a 405 Method Not Allowed
  error, followed by a 403 Forbidden error.
- 600 requests per 5 minutes - Enforced by AWS WAF
errors:
- '403 Forbidden: The API Signature is wrong'
- '404 Not Found: The requested endpoint does not exist'
- '405 Method Not Allowed: Check if the rate limit is exceeded'
- '403 Forbidden: Check if the rate limit is exceeded'
- '405 Method Not Allowed: Rate limit exceeded'
- '403 Forbidden: Rate limit exceeded'
