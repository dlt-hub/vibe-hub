In this guide, we'll set up a complete Payrexx data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def payrexx_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.payrexx.com/v1.0/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
,
        },
        "resources": [
            "contact",
            "payout",
            "gateway"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='payrexx_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='payrexx_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(payrexx_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from payrexx‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Payment Transactions: Manage and retrieve transactions.
- Gateways: Handle payment gateways, including creation and retrieval.
- Invoices: Manage and retrieve invoices related to transactions.
- Subscriptions: Manage subscriptions, including creating and logging in customers.
- Payment Methods: Handle various payment methods available.
- Signature Verification: Verify signatures for security purposes.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Payrexx workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@payrexx-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Payrexx support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:payrexx duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@payrexx-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Payrexx API, as specified in @payrexx-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "contact" and "payout" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in payrexx_pipeline.py and name the pipeline payrexx_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python payrexx_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is handled using OAuth2 with a key placed in the header under the name 'X-API-KEY'.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.payrexx.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python payrexx_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline payrexx load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset payrexx_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/payrexx.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline payrexx_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("payrexx_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "contact" table as Pandas frame
   data."contact".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Important considerations include: Ensure payment providers support preauthorizations, manage API rate limits strictly (600 requests per 5 minutes), handle redirections manually when using IFrame, and ensure responses are sent within 20 seconds to avoid timeouts.
