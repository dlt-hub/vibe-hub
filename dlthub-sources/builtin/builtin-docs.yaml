notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This feature adds a lang IDL attribute to CanvasTextDrawingStyles to give developers
  direct control over the language for the text drawing and metrics.
- The dynamic-range-limit property enables a page to limit the maximum brightness
  of HDR content.
- To eliminate user browsing history leaks, anchor elements are styled as :visited
  only if they have been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before.
- The print-color-adjust property lets you adjust colors in printed web pages.
- The CSS Working Group has resolved to replace string attr() type with raw-string.
- The fallback part of a var() function does not validate against the type of the
  custom property being referenced.
- Chrome's HTTP cache keying scheme is updated to include an is-cross-site-main-frame-navigation
  boolean to mitigate cross-site leak attacks.
- This change also improves privacy by preventing a malicious site from using navigations
  to infer whether a user has visited a given site previously.
- The Language Detector and Translator APIs work in Chrome on desktop.
- These APIs do not work on mobile devices.
- Available from Chrome 138 stable
- Join the Writer API origin trial.
- The Writer API is available in a joint origin trial with the Rewriter API.
- The `pause()` method of the `Atomics` object is added to hint the CPU that the current
  code is executing a spinlock.
- The `FileSystemObserver` interface notifies websites of changes to the file system.
- This opt out trial lets sites opt out from the freezing on Energy Saver behavior
  that ships in Chrome 133.
- From Chrome 127 concurrent same-document view transitions in a main frame and same-origin
  iframe will be available.
- Scrollers are click-focusable and programmatically-focusable by default.
- The summary of summaries technique helps you operate within a client-size model's
  context window.
- Less accurate summaries may result from recursion.
- Cross-document view transitions are now enabled by default for same-origin navigations.
- Tabbed mode adds a tab strip to standalone web apps in ChromeOS that allows multiple
  tabs to be open at once.
- Uses Cache API for optimal performance, to ensure quick access to AI models, reducing
  load times and improving responsiveness.
- OPFS and IndexedDB are less usable options for large models.
- 'Stable release date: August 20th, 2024'
- Streaming data looks different from the server and the client.
- Each line of the streamed response begins with 'data:' followed by the message payload.
- The Prompt API uses the Gemini Nano model in Chrome.
- The API supports audio and image inputs.
- Chrome 132 stable channel release includes various updates for HTML, CSS, Media,
  and Web APIs.
- New features and updates include support for dialog toggle events, capture of all
  screens, and the Device Posture API.
- Structured output isn't implemented yet at the time of this writing.
- 'Keyboard focusable scrollers will be enabled by default starting in Chrome 130.
  If websites need time to adjust to this new feature, there are a few options: The
  Keyboard focusable scrollers opt out deprecation trial can be used to opt back out
  of the feature for a limited time on a given site. This can be used through Chrome
  132, ending March 18, 2025.'
- Each session has a context window that you can see by accessing the session's relevant
  fields inputQuota and inputUsage.
- 'Stable release date: March 4th, 2025'
- APIs do not work on mobile devices.
- The Rewriter API is available in a joint origin trial with the Writer API.
- You can run Lighthouse against any web page, public or requiring authentication.
- ChromeDriver is a standalone server that implements the W3C WebDriver and WebDriver
  BiDi standards.
- Capabilities are a language-neutral set of key-value pairs used to define the desired
  features and behavior of a WebDriver session.
- No AI/ML expertise is required. Designing a prompt requires iterations, but the
  rest of the code is standard web development.
- Client-side models are fairly accurate. If you run the snippets from this document,
  you'll observe that both the toxicity and sentiment analysis give accurate results.
  The Gemma ratings, for the most part, matched the Gemini model ratings for a few
  tested reference reviews. In order to validate that accuracy, more testing is required.
- Inference can be lightning fast. If you run the snippets from this document, you
  should observe that inference can get fast, potentially faster than server round
  trips, on a number of devices. That said, inference speed can vary greatly. Thorough
  benchmarking on target devices is needed. We expect browser inference to keep getting
  faster with WebGPU, WebAssembly, and library updates.
- Download sizes can be very large. Inference in the browser is fast, but loading
  AI models can be a challenge. To perform in-browser AI, you typically need both
  a library and a model, which add to your web app's download size.
- The `command` and `commandfor` attributes on `<button>` elements let you assign
  behaviour to buttons in a more accessible and declarative way.
- Adds support for `<link rel="facilitated-payment" href="...">` as a hint that the
  browser should notify registered payment clients about a pending push payment.
- Uses Firebase for AI features with end-to-end encryption.
- The Summarizer API is available from Chrome 138 stable.
- 'Stable release date: September 17th, 2024'
- Chrome 124 is stable as of 16 April 2024.
