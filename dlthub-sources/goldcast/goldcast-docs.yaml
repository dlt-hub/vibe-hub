- We recommend bookmarking the status page for quick access.
- We recommend subscribing to updates for real-time notifications.
- Ensure you use the correct stream URL and key to avoid broadcast issues.
- Make sure to confirm the stream key and server URL match exactly to prevent connection
  errors.
- We generally recommend temporarily disabling firewalls before an event, as they
  may interfere with certain features on the Goldcast platform.
- If you have an ad blocking extension installed on your browser, you need to whitelist
  the Goldcast events website.
- You can change speaker assignments anytime.
- If a speaker is not added to a session, they wonâ€™t have access to the backstage
  area.
