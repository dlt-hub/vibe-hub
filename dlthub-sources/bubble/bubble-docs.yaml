notes:
- You need to set the redirection URIs in Stripe as 'https://bubble.io/poststripeauth'
  or 'https://d##.bubble.is/poststripeauth' for Dedicated environments in order for
  this to work.
- It is important that you have set up a Stripe webhook so that you can be notified
  by Stripe of changes and respond to the event ‘customer.subscription.deleted’.
- The setting *End of billing period* is an advanced setting.
- Making the app private will not prevent people from seeing it on the web in Live
  mode.
- Bubble employees will not have access to the Data – App data tab and cannot see/edit
  database records in any of your app's databases.
- When checked, you can define a username and password that restricts access to the
  page.
- The Bubble API is for inbound API calls.
- Must be enabled in Settings - API.
- Custom states reset when the page is reloaded.
- URL parameters are not reset on page reload, but may disappear if modified.
- Uses Google Analytics or Segment with Google Analytics as a destination
- Requires setup of Google Optimize account
- All preview modes load your app in the development version.
- 'The URL will include `version-test`, like so: `https://yourapp.bubbleapps.io/version-test`.'
- Currently, lists are limited to 10,000 items. Trying to add additional items will
  result in an error message.
- context.request is being deprecated, moved to context.v3.request, and will now return
  a promise.
- context.async is also being deprecated, moved to context.v3.async, and will now
  return a promise.
- Be sure to use the bare domain (no 'www'), as including the 'www' can lead to unexpected
  behavior when using the App Connector in workflows.
- The principle of least privilege is important when setting up API connections.
- Ensure that API calls designed to fetch or read data do not have the power to change
  or delete that data.
- Temporary user data is cleared after three days.
- Enabling CloudFlare requires changing DNS entries at your domain registrar, and
  may incur a few minutes downtime.
- If you use a bare domain and you wish to keep your existing domain record, ensure
  your registrar supports ALIAS or ANAME records, or bare domain CNAME records, before
  toggling this checkbox.
- Bubble retains a 25% commission on all Template and Plugin License payments.
- All open source plugins and templates must be set as free in the marketplace.
- Users cannot combine the Student or Non-Profit discount with other discounts.
- The scopes 'schema.bases:read' and 'data.records:read' are required for the plugin
  to work correctly.
- If you rename a table that you have previously connected, this can cause existing
  references to fail until Bubble knows the updated name.
- API Connecter calls are by default sent from the Bubble server (for non-dedicated
  Bubble apps) and thus susceptible to 3rd party API rate limiting since the rate
  limit is shared across all Bubble apps.
- Consider sending the call from the browser, when appropriate, if rate limiting is
  a concern.
- If there are special characters in the password, they must be URL-encoded.
- For SELECT statements, you must add LIMIT N at the end, where N <= 200.
- The Bubble API is accessible on paid plans, so your application will need to be
  on a paid plan in order to use the Zapier plugin.
