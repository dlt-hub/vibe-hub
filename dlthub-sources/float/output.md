In this guide, we'll set up a complete Float data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def float_project_management_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.float.com/v3/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "people",
            "departments",
            "tasks"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='float_project_management_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='float_project_management_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(float_project_management_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from float_project_management‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- People Management: Manage and retrieve information about people in the organization.
- Department Management: Retrieve information about departments.
- Task Management: Manage and retrieve tasks, with capabilities to filter by various parameters.
- Time and Attendance: Manage and record time-offs and logged time, including creating and retrieving time-related entries.
- Project Management: Create and manage projects, phases, and milestones.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Float workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@float_project_management-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Float support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:float_project_management duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@float_project_management-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Float API, as specified in @float_project_management-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "people" and "departments" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in float_project_management_pipeline.py and name the pipeline float_project_management_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python float_project_management_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is carried out via a Bearer token which should be kept secure and not shared with untrusted parties. The token remains valid as long as the account is active or until it is regenerated.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.float.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python float_project_management_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline float_project_management load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset float_project_management_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/float_project_management.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline float_project_management_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("float_project_management_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "people" table as Pandas frame
   data."people".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Sensitive handling of API tokens is crucial as they are treated like passwords. All interactions must be done over HTTPS. The API has rate limiting which may result in a 429 error if exceeded. Pay attention to error responses and ensure proper handling of 400, 401, 422, and 500 status codes. Beware of potential issues when scheduling tasks on dates with full-day time offs, as they will not be visible in the UI.
