In this guide, we'll set up a complete Realhub data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def realhub_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://realhub.realbase.io/api/v2/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "order.approved",
            "agencies",
            "ad_copies"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='realhub_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='realhub_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(realhub_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from realhub‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Orders: Manage and approve order related operations.
- Agencies: Retrieve and manage agency related data.
- Ad Copies: Manage ad copies associated with campaigns.
- Campaigns: Search and manage campaign related data.
- Publication Bookings: Handle bookings for publications.
- Artworks: Manage artwork details and operations.
- Reports: Generate various reports on orders and bookings.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Realhub workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@realhub-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Realhub support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:realhub duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@realhub-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Realhub API, as specified in @realhub-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "order.approved" and "agencies" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in realhub_pipeline.py and name the pipeline realhub_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python realhub_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    The Realhub API authenticates via an API key that must be included in the headers of each request under the key 'Authorization'. This API key is environment-specific, meaning different keys are required for different database environments.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.realhub.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python realhub_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline realhub load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset realhub_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/realhub.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline realhub_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("realhub_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "order.approved" table as Pandas frame
   data."order.approved".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure that the correct API key is used for the specific environment you are interacting with, as each environment requires a unique key. Pay attention to the HTTP status codes returned by the API, such as 400, 401, 403, and 500, which indicate various errors and permissions issues.
