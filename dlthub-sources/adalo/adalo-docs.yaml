notes:
- Due to the app store guidelines, you'll need to add the 'Sign In with Apple' component
  or your app will get rejected.
- Ensure you are on an Adalo Plan that includes API integration.
- Check your App Actions Dashboard usage. API requests will fail if you have no remaining
  actions left in your billing cycle.
- Verify you have set up your Collection Permissions correctly to allow access to
  the apps Database.
- You can use our External Collections feature to connect to almost any REST API.
- Utilizing custom actions you can display local weather in your app!
- Your API key is required for all requests to the Adalo API!
- You can exceed the rate limit of 5 requests per second and receive a 429 status
  code.
- The Webview Component cannot access Microphone permissions on Native Builds.
- The Webview Component cannot access the Video Camera of your device as this requires
  microphone permissions. Your native build may crash if you attempt to do so.
- The component does not currently work with coupon codes.
- In-App Purchases only work for apps downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google
  Play Store.
- Google provides free $200/month credit for the location and maps API usage.
- If you lose your API Key or it becomes compromised, you will have to create a new
  API Key.

- This process will take about 14 business days.
- You will need a paid Adalo plan to use this feature.
- Ensure you have created your Apple Developer account and app Bundle ID.

  account.
- App names must be limited to 30 characters and should not include prices, terms,
  or descriptions that are not the name of the app.
- App Names cannot include special characters such as '~' or '"'. This may cause your
  build to fail within the Adalo Builder.
- Users will be prompted for Camera, Notifications, and Location but will not see
  a prompt for Photo Library permissions.

  our products. This data is never used for tracking or advertising and is not rented,
  sold, or given to advertisers.

- Adaloâ€™s Collections API supports filtering records via query parameters on single-value
  properties only.
- Triggering Notifications through the API is available on the Team or Business Plan.

  Adalo API.
- Currently it is not possible to set which screen the user will be taken to. For
  now, they will be taken to the app's home screen.

  it will result in empty/null values in Xano.
- Make sure to hit the Publish Button after making changes to your Xano APIs.
- You will need to have a Mixpanel Account.
