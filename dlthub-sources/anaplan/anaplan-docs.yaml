notes:
- The information here is subject to change right up until each release is live.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Anaplan XL Reporting connects to a range of data sources including Microsoft SQL
  Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular and Multidimensional, Power BI, SAP HANA,
  IBM TM1, Kyvos, Incorta, Atoti, Anaplan, and Anaplan Financial Close and Consolidation.
- Anaplan XL Reporting can also connect directly to relational databases.
- The most common problems you may encounter when you create a formula are described
  on this page.
- For security reasons, an Anaplan login expires automatically after 35 minutes of
  inactivity. After your login expires, you must log in again.
- You can use Breakback in Polaris. However, if Breakback affects more than 1,000,000
  cells, the system displays a warning message.
- The behavior of Switchover in Polaris differs from Classic regarding data preservation.
  The current Polaris implementation keeps the primary data from before switchover,
  when it's enabled. This means data reappears when Switchover is disabled. This feature
  shouldn't be relied upon as a model building practice. Switchover behavior may change
  in future releases and Anaplan does not guarantee this behaviour remains the same.
- In Polaris, a model may contain up to 10,000 line items.
- In Polaris, a model may contain up to 100 versions.
- In Polaris, a model may contain up to 10,000 list properties.
- In Polaris, the maximum length of a formula is 2,000 characters.
- In Polaris, there is a 10,000 character limit for cells. If you enter or paste more
  than the limit, you receive an error message.
- When you build formulas, it's advisable to break up multiple time series functions
  within a formula, across different line items.
- If any time series functions (CUMULATE, DECUMULATE, POST, OFFSET, LAG, LEAD, SPREAD,
  or MOVINGSUM) are used as an argument to another time series function it's advisable
  to assign the inner argument to a separate line item.
- There are already optimizations for certain cases like POST or OFFSET with a constant
  offset that behaves like a ‘normal' argument, so for example CUMULATE(POST(x, 12))
  doesn't suffer from the same performance issue.
- Values automatically aggregate between different time scales.
- Aggregation can skip levels, so days can aggregate into years.
- Values do not aggregate from greater time scales into smaller ones.
- You can only use each type of operator with certain types, or combinations, of data.
- When you concatenate large numbers of, or long, text strings, it can have a negative
  impact on model performance.
- Anaplan XL Reporting supports a wide variety of data sources, including relational
  databases and big data providers.
- If you use single sign-on (SSO) to access Anaplan, this set of instructions doesn't
  apply to you.
- If your account is locked, see Help me log in
- The Anaplan mobile app is only compatible with devices with unaltered factory settings.
- The app does not work on jailbroken iOS devices and rooted Android devices.
- You can only edit data if a model builder has set the correct access permissions.
- Editable cells contain purple text.
- You can also set up the query time-out to prevent long-running queries from causing
  Excel to hang.
- If the required policy isn't set, you can't add connections, no data will be retrieved,
  and dialogs won't open until the correct security settings have been applied.
- After setting an IRM policy, save the workbook for the changes to take effect. Sensitivity
  label changes are applied when the label is changed.
- User authentication in Anaplan is inherited by the add-in.
- The add-in only supports English.
- Self Service Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) must be configured to sign
  in to the add-on with Single Sign-On (SSO). Talk to your tenant administrator to
  confirm if Self Service SAML is configured. If Self Service SAML is not configured,
  sign in with your Anaplan email address and password.
- Google Chrome is supported for the add-on. Other browsers are not supported.
- A connection between Anaplan and a new worksheet uses at least 26,000 cells from
  the 1 million in the worksheet. This is to protect any custom data you enter into
  cells outside the data you retrieve from Anaplan.
- You must map the source columns to target dimensions before you can further configure
  the options to clear the target for each dimension.
- Must be assigned the Integration Admin or Restricted Integration User role by someone
  with the Tenant Admin role.
- Need read or write access to models and workspaces associated with your integrations.
- 'Need permissions: Read for import, Write for export, related to files in your Amazon
  (AWS) S3 buckets, Google BigQuery tables, and Azure Blob containers.'
- Default lists exist in all models. They cannot be deleted and are always available
  to use as dimensions.
- It's recommended practice to set your line item's summary method to None, and only
  use another summary method when you need it.
- When there are no input values, the methods return the default value of the data
  type associated with them.
- By default, no users have access once selective access is enabled.
- Selective access can also be updated by importing into a list or the users list.
- CA authentication enables you to use certificates from an external public CA with
  Anaplan APIs and Anaplan Connect.
- If your certificate expires, you must obtain a new one for successful CA authentication.
- User administrators can create users, add them to workspaces, or delete them from
  workspaces in Administration.
- Workspace administrators can add or remove users from the Users pane in a model.
- Workspace administrators can import a list of users to add users and update user
  details in a model.
- To avoid user status conflicts, we recommend that your organization use the User
  Administrator role to add or remove users.
- Workspace administrators can't add or remove users from within models.
- Some model features are only available to workspace administrators.
- 'Read-only connection: up to 700,000 cells per sheet, with styling disabled.'
- 'Read/write connection: up to 120,000 cells per sheet, with styling disabled.'
- These limits include empty cells within a worksheet. We recommend removing any unnecessary
  empty rows and columns to optimize your use of the connections.
- You can't create a connection to a module that contains a dimension with more than
  1 million items.
- Only user administrators can add or remove users from the Internal page in Administration.
- New users receive a welcome email that invites them to log in and change their password.
- When you add a new user by import, they're added to other models within the workspace
  the next time those models are opened.
- If you import a blank parent for an item that already has a parent, this removes
  the parent.
- Optimizer is not available in Polaris.
- Optimizer is an entitled service, so you must opt-in to access the feature.
- When you log in to the app for the first time a dialog box asks for your permission
  to send notifications.
- If you have an Android device, you're automatically registered to receive notifications
  on your phone.
- Once SSO is set up, users can only access Anaplan using SSO unless they are an exception
  user.
- Your organization must schedule an appropriate time to enforce SSO.
- It's essential that your organization educates your users on how to access the Friendly
  URL.
- The Self Service SAML interface is designed for users who are familiar with SAML
  configurations of SSO implementations.
- Data in transit uses HTTPS with 2048-bit certificates. Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) 1.2 is the minimum version that Anaplan supports, and TLS 1.3 is the maximum
  supported version.
- Data at rest uses AES-256 full-disk encryption.
- Anaplan only supports browsers that use the RFC-6455 WebSocket protocol.
- A tenant is a client account within the Anaplan platform. It contains client workspaces
  and authorized users.
- If you're both a workspace administrator and a tenant administrator, you can view
  your workspace regional data center from Administration.
- If your workspace exceeds 5,000 models, you may experience connectivity issues.
  To reduce the number of models in your workspace, delete outdated, archived, or
  unused models.
- Your company should only assign exception users when you need a backup for when
  you log in to SSO.
- It's crucial that your company explains to employees how to access the friendly
  URL.
- Note that the friendly URL format has specific configuration requirements.
- For security reasons, Anaplan's idle timeout is set at 35 minutes.
- BYOK is an additional product your organization can purchase if it has the Enterprise
  edition.
- Deployed mode locks down production models
- Use Standard mode for development models
- The _ab fields are added by Data Orchestrator and aren't user data.
- You can’t use a shared access signature (SAS) token as the secret key.
- Data Orchestrator uses the _ab fields as cursor keys to identify what's changed.
- Salesforce doesn't immediately purge records, even if you delete them from the recycle
  bin.
- The final table contains a column labeled isDeleted, which indicates whether the
  row has been deleted.
- You are limited to running a maximum of 100 data extracts and a maximum of 100 model
  links in any 24-hour period per package.
