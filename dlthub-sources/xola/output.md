In this guide, we'll set up a complete Xola data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def xola_migrations_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://sandbox.xola.com/api/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "user_preferences",
            "affiliates",
            "coupons"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='xola_migrations_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='xola_migrations_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(xola_migrations_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from xola_migrations‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- User Preferences: Manage user settings and preferences.
- Affiliate Management: Handle operations related to affiliates, including payments and details.
- Demographics: Retrieve demographic information related to users or experiences.
- Order Adjustments: Modify and manage orders, such as changing quantity or checking in guests.
- Experience Scheduling: Manage schedules and availability for experiences.
- Coupons and Discounts: Operations related to managing coupons, including creation and application behavior.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Xola workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@xola_migrations-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Xola support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:xola_migrations duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@xola_migrations-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Xola API, as specified in @xola_migrations-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "user_preferences" and "affiliates" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in xola_migrations_pipeline.py and name the pipeline xola_migrations_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python xola_migrations_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Xola utilizes OAuth2 authentication. Tokens are used in authorization headers. There are specific roles and permissions required for different actions, ensuring secure and role-appropriate access to resources.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.xola.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python xola_migrations_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline xola_migrations load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset xola_migrations_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/xola_migrations.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline xola_migrations_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("xola_migrations_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "user_preferences" table as Pandas frame
   data."user_preferences".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

API usage involves understanding specific roles like ROLE_CURATOR or ROLE_SELLER_ADMIN for certain actions. Errors must be handled properly, especially those related to resource conflicts or unauthorized access. It's crucial to develop and test in a sandbox environment before production deployment.
