notes:
- API v1 and this route are not available to projects that are using ReadMe Refactored.
- Exports are not complete. Some information is lost during the exporting process.
- Avoid importing versions that already exist in ReadMe. If there are clashing versions,
  the imported versions will be bumped up.
- API v1 and this route are not available to projects that are using ReadMe Refactored.
  Check out our API migration guide for information on how to migrate to the new API.
- Every ReadMe plan has access to up to 24 hours of API logs history.
- To view one full year of API request history, you can upgrade your Developer Dashboard
  experience.
- Although ReadMe’s outbound IP addresses may change, the IPs in this API response
  will be valid for at least 7 days.
- To enable bi-directional sync, a new Git repository is required and must be completely
  empty—no commits or files before connecting to ReadMe.
- Your GHES server must be accessible from the internet—syncing won't work if it's
  behind a VPN.
- Algolia does not index every single character on every single page in every project.
- Indexing limitations include up to 3,000 characters following every heading and
  up to about 400 words in tables.
- Scrub your API logs of confidential information before sending to ReadMe
- All hub users must be authenticated in order to see real API request history data
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Enterprise group must be public in order for Viewers to preview Staging in the Hub.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Moved from Basic Authentication to Bearer Authentication
- Use 'stable' in the API URL for the default version
- ReadMe's outbound IP addresses may change, the IPs in the API response will be valid
  for at least 7 days.
- If you configure your API or webhooks to limit access based on these IPs, you should
  refresh the IP list from this endpoint weekly.
- This feature is only available on Business and Enterprise plans.
- ReadMe retains all data indefinitely.
- Data is encrypted at rest by our database providers (Clickhouse and MongoDB).
- OpenAPI definitions can contain a mix of paths and webhooks as of January 2024.
- We currently do not support servers declarations at the Path Item level.
- Exports are available for Business and Enterprise plans
- Exports are limited to 1 million rows for larger segments, apply filters or adjust
  your date range prior to exporting.
- Additional customization options and services are available on Business and Enterprise
  plans.
- API Access for Owlbot is only available on our enterprise plan.
- Get API keys for your ReadMe project.
- By default, the Markdown library exports a function which takes a string of ReadMe-flavored
  markdown and returns a tree of React components.
- 'If your ReadMe plan doesn’t support custom CSS: you’ll see a one-time ''Enable
  Dark Mode'' button.'
- 'If your ReadMe plan supports Custom CSS: you’ll configure your default color scheme
  in the Theme Editor page.'
- In order to successfully set up your repo, your APIs need to contain an OpenAPI
  Specification (OAS) in JSON or YAML format.
- The API must be REST-based.
- Endpoint should bypass any standard authentication that you may have set up and
  should be able to accept requests from dash.readme.com.
- These features are only available on Business and Enterprise plans
- Redirects are performed in the order they are written; if there are multiple matches
  for an origin URL, the first match is used.
- Mermaid is a powerful diagramming tool that allows you to create various types of
  diagrams using text-based syntax.
- Start with a simple structure and build from there.
- Custom Pages are great when you want to retain the top navigation of your ReadMe
  project, but also want a custom look below the search bar.
- Custom Pages are not affected by versioning and are shared. If you delete a Custom
  Page it will be removed from everywhere.
- Authentication persists via browser cookies.
- You can set a custom expiration period under 'advanced options' in Site Navigation
  > Custom Login to require your users to log in again after a certain timeframe.
- Automatically provision API keys for new users
- You should limit your changes to minor tweaks. Additionally, stylesheets aren't
  versioned; all versions use the same stylesheet.
- Your Javascript will be included at the bottom of the page.
- Disables the API Explorer's "Try It" button, preventing users from making API requests
  from within your docs.
- Custom code samples are treated as static content.
- Documentation can be set to fully public and viewable by anyone, or gated behind
  a specific protection type.
- Each protection type grants the ability to view all content within a project.
- Auto-populating parameters currently only works for single-project.
- Reusable Content is available on ReadMe Business and Enterprise plans.
- rdme@10 only works with ReadMe projects that are using ReadMe Refactored.
- Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 10 items by default.
- You can set a custom page size up to 100 with the perPage query parameter.

- This endpoint will return the live version of your document, whereas the standard
  endpoint will always return staging.
- Some variables vary depending on the primary color of your header background (set
  in the Appearance page, if it's dark or light).
- If you’re using a service like Google Fonts, you'll need to include the <link />
  elements in your Custom HTML.
- ReadMe's outbound IP addresses may change, refresh the IP list weekly
- We recommend specifying a fixed version, i.e. @v10
- Projects that are part of an Enterprise Group please see our Enterprise User Management

- If you want to execute API requests you will need to pass in an api key.
- Your ReadMe project must contain at least one OpenAPI file (OAS spec), done via
  one of our upload methods or using the manual API editor
- You need to complete the Set Up API Keys configuration step by deploying the Personalized
  Docs Webhook.
- We highly recommend sending API logs to ReadMe by integrating the Metrics SDK
- 'No Credit Card Required: Start your trial without needing to provide credit card
  details.'
- If you have accidentally set a CAA record, it may take up to 24 hours for your cert
  to be regenerated by us.
- Our custom hostnames and SSL certificates only work for a single host.
- Our API has a default rate limit of 100 requests per minute.
- Highly Recommended ReadMe strongly recommends enabling two-factor authentication

- Run workflow for every push to the main branch
- Sync the Markdown contents of the documentation directory to version 2.0 of your
  ReadMe project
- A ReadMe account is required to configure any ReadMe SDK.

- 'Keep it updated: Whenever your API changes, update your specification to ensure
  your documentation stays accurate'
- 'Use detailed descriptions: Take advantage of the description fields in your OAS
  file to provide context'
