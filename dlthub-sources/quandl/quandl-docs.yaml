notes:
- Requests will require time for processing. Check the status value to know when files
  are ready.
- These tables datasets are not real-time; most update once a day with a 1-day lag.
- Users who are not appending any API key to their Tables API call (ie. “anonymous
  users”) have a combined limit of 20 calls per 10 minutes and 50 calls per day.
- Users who are not subscribed to any premium data, but who are appending their API
  key to their API call, have a limit of 300 calls per 10 seconds, 2,000 calls per
  10 minutes and a limit of 50,000 calls per day.
- Authenticated users have a concurrency limit of one; that is, they can make one
  call at a time and have an additional call in the queue.
- Premium data subscribers who are subscribed to at least one tables dataset, and
  who are appending their API key to their API call, have a limit of 5,000 calls per
  10 minutes and a limit of 720,000 calls per day.
- Premium data subscribers who are bulk downloading an entire table using the qopts.export_true
  parameter may only use qopts.export=true 60 times in one hour.
- The API supports multiple response formats including JSON, XML, and CSV.
- An API call that does not include any filter will attempt to download the entire
  table but is limited to 10,000 rows.
- The data returned by the Tables API is unsorted by default. Data sorting must be
  done locally.
- The generated link is only valid for 30 minutes.
- To use the add-in, you will need an API key, which comes with your free Nasdaq Data
  Link account.
- Tested with Python 3
- Tested with Tableau Desktop 2022.2
- The tables API is limited to 10,000 rows per call.
- Using `paginate=True` will extend the limit to 1,000,000 rows.
- Using paginate=TRUE will extend the limit to 1,000,000 rows.
- Only columns designated as 'filterable' in the table's documentation page can be
  used as criteria to filter rows.
- Uses API key for authentication
- To gain access to these products on Nasdaq Data Link, please contact our Sales Team.
- If you would like to make more than 50 calls a day, you will need to create a free
  account and set your API key.
- You must set your API key to download the premium datasets to which you are subscribed.
- If you are not receiving all the expected data, please double check your API key.
  If a valid API key is not used, some tables will default to returning sample data.
- If you are not receiving all the expected data, please double check your API key.
- Only columns designated as “filterable” in the table's documentation page can be
  used as criteria to filter rows.
- The R package cannot be used with real-time products. Real-time products may be
  accessed through the Streaming API or REST API for real-time or delayed data.
