notes:
- Drata only requires read access, which is the default setting for all Kolide API
  tokens.
- This document should not be interpreted as legal advice.
- Be sure to review https://help.drata.com/en/articles/6116924-gdpr-where-do-i-start
  if you have not already.
- Only one configuration source per machine will be read, with the Drata agent taking
  precedence.
- Mobile Device Management is not offered for the Workspace ONE Employee Essentials
  and Desktop Essentials plans.
- Due to SOAP API constraints, the password should not have an '&' symbol.
- A rate limit of 500 requests / minute will be enforced per unique source IP.
- Be specific about the query parameters to filter events.
- Ensure you are signed into Microsoft 365 already or you will be prompted to do so
  upon connection from Drata.
- You must be enforcing MFA on Microsoft 365 via Conditional Access Policies or Security
  Defaults.
- There can be delays from the Microsoft API in syncing all users, so please wait
  a few minutes before verifying all user accounts have synced.
- Please ensure you have toggled the setting for 'Third-party application access via
  OAuth' to ON under Organization Settings -> Policies.
- Custom Device Connections are available on the Advanced and Enterprise plans.
- The third-party platform configuration as well as the automation of the workflow
  and its cadence is set by the customer.
- A daily PDF is generated, reported, and syncs to Drata as 'Miscellaneous evidence'.
- A control with the code AIKIDO is created and linked to the relevant SOC 2 and ISO
  27001 requirements.
- Chromebooks satisfy Hard Drive Encryption by default.
- Chromebooks can be made to satisfy Screensaver Lock with a 15 Minute Timeout and
  a Password Manager by adjusting settings and installing a password manager from
  the Google Chrome Web Store.
- Chromebooks support Automatic Updates by default, but this feature can be disabled.
- Chromebooks have limited support for Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware; third party solutions
  are recommended.
- If your Chromebook does not support Screensaver Lock, consult your auditor.
- Tokens cannot be shared across workspaces. To add a separate workspace you must
  obtain a new token from the workspace and create a new Fibery connection.
- This connection supports the first 350 accounts detected in your organization.
- AWS organizational units sync across your workspaces.
- The DrataAutopilotRole will not be created in the single account where the CloudFormation
  StackSet was deployed.
- Ensure specific APIs are enabled in the project.
- GCP service account must have access to Google Workspace account through domain-wide
  delegation.
- You must be assigned the TriNet role of 'Integration Administrator' or work with
  someone in your company with the appropriate access.
- Ensure you save the API key expiration date. You will have to update the API key
  within Drata before it expires to ensure you stay connected.
- If your role has read-only permissions enabled, you can only view, filter, and download
  the data on the pages available to your role. You cannot modify the data or do certain
  actions available on that page.
- Requires AWS infrastructure integration for certain tests.
- Datadog Service Account needs Usage Read Permission.
- Password for the Integration System User should not have an '&' symbol due to SOAP
  API constraints.
- Rapid7 InsightVM reports are only accessible through an InsightVM console server.
- The console must be on a public network and access must be made available to Drata
  IP addresses.
- There is a delay between the initial connection and the first import of user accounts,
  which should take no more than one hour for customers with hundreds of users.
- Drata does not support nested groups. Only top-level group members will be synced.
- We recommend that you require this where possible. However, depending on the locality
  of the employee/contractor, this may not always be possible due to legal/privacy
  laws and regulations in specific jurisdictions.
- Regardless of who owns the device, compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001
  do contain controls around securing workstations.
- If the devices cannot access Protected Health Information (PHI) they will be out
  of scope. If they can access PHI, they will be in-scope.
- You must enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to view MFA data on the Drata
  platform.
- The IdP connection is the only required connection on Drata, which will pull in
  your personnel and allow them to authenticate into their My Drata page.
- The HRIS connection will enrich the personnel records with audit-ready 'source of
  truth' data to better paint a picture of your personnel during your audit period.
- API keys should be treated as 'house keys' and not shared with unauthorized individuals.
- API keys currently have an expiration date (set to approximately two years in the
  future). Users can adjust the expiration date as desired.
- Drata will pull up to 1,000 new or updated vulnerabilities for each connection daily,
  ordered by severity from critical to low.
- You must have a DocuSign plan with the Organization Management feature enabled.
- You must also be assigned the Organization Admin role within DocuSign to complete
  the connection.
- Ensure you have Admin (ACCOUNTADMIN) access to your company's Snowflake account.
- You may need to highlight the command and then run to only run that command.
- Certn connection is not available for EU-based customers
- OneID, also known as Enhanced Identity Verification, is required for Canadian and
  International background checks. It is also recommended for US background checks.
- Kandji cannot natively pick up browser extensions, so if those are being used as
  a password manager, that compliance check will fail.
- Ensure that the app shows on the device's Application List.
- JumpCloud's APIs do not expose installed applications on Linux devices.
- JumpCloud’s Patch Management feature is not fully supported at this time.
- Microsoft 365 must be your connected IdP
- You must be enforcing MFA on Microsoft 365 via Conditional Access Policies or Security
  Defaults
- Ensure specific APIs are enabled in the project
- Drata does not support pulling members within groups
- Auditors may request additional evidence for each control.
- Drata only requires the ability to view Alerts to satisfy the requirements for this
  integration.
- As of this beta, only ‘View’ permissions on ‘Alerts’ are needed.
- Your API token carries the same privileges as your user, so be sure to keep it secret.
- Tokens cannot be shared across workspaces.
- Drata does not support custom fields when creating Azure DevOps Boards Work Items.
- A 400 error will occur if a Work Item requires custom fields.
- Ensure to follow the incident response procedures as outlined in the documentation.

- This is a partner connection that is externally managed.
- Use the exact secret names (`DRATA_API_KEY`, `JIT_CLIENT_ID`, and `JIT_CLIENT_SECRET`)
  to ensure the integration functions correctly.
- Ensure you are on MacOS Monterey 12 or later.
- If you did not install one of the supported antivirus software options, follow the
  requirements below.
- These items should be enabled by default on Mac computers, but we recommend you
  double-check their configuration.
- If you fail the AV check, it means XProtect or Gatekeeper was not enabled AND that
  no supported antivirus app was found.
- There is a delay between the initial connection and the first import of user accounts.
  At the longest this should take no more than one hour for customers with hundreds
  of users.
- Drata does not support nested groups. We will sync members in the top level of the
  specified group, but not members in any second-level or further groups.
errors:
- '400 error: Custom fields required for Work Item.'
