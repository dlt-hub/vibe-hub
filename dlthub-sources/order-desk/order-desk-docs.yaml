notes:
- Connect to the Order Desk API in a background process and not through a customer-facing
  interface.
- Either destination_folder_id or destination_folder_name should be used, but not
  both.
- API access should not be assumed to have 100% uptime.
- Ensure asynchronous processing when importing orders.
