notes:
- This integration is currently in Beta.
- The default behavior for users left off your HRIS sync file is to set their end
  date to the import date, categorizing them as former employees.
- You cannot configure both SSO methods simultaneously.
- If your account is hosted on the EU or AU data center, insert .eu or .au immediately
  after the subdomain in the URL.
- For security reasons, it's best to create this API Key from an Admin user account
  that only has access to the data fields you wish to sync with Culture Amp.
- Workday uses our full import process. When your data syncs, any employees not included
  in your data file will become inactive as former employees, with their End Date
  set to the import date.
- If your ADP setup requires 2FA and you encounter this issue, we recommend switching
  to an SFTP connection for ADP integration instead.
- IntelliHR does not support the ability to exclude users via an exclusion field.
- 'Important: Humaans does not support the ability to exclude users via an exclusion
  field.'
- The Employee Data Integration only supports openSSH key pairs, not SSH2.
- Be wary of sharing your private key. Don't send it anywhere via email, text or through
  any other insecure means.
- Changes to employee data in Culture Amp will not flow back to EmploymentHero.
- Default behavior for users left off your HRIS sync file is to set their end date
  to the import date.

- It only gives you access to data from surveys with the raw data option turned on.
- Once a survey is launched, you can't go back and enable raw data.
- The API does not anonymize survey data or provide access to de-identified responses.
- To avoid confusion from users about which demographic to use, we would recommend
  navigating to the Settings > Account Demographics page and deleting the old demographics
  after your first sync.
- As part of our commitment to data security, only data relevant to your import and
  field mappings will be stored.
- Uses OAuth2 with Paycor credentials
- If you prefer that users left off your HRIS sync file are treated as deactivated
  instead, just reply with 'Ask a Person' in a Support Conversation.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Default behavior for users left off your HRIS sync file is to set their end date
  to the import date
- If you prefer that these users are treated as deactivated instead, just contact
  Culture Amp Support, and we can adjust the default setting.
- Demographic data for survey participants isn't available through the Survey API
  right now but will be added in the next few months.
- Surveys must have the Raw Data Extract setting enabled at time of launch to be retrievable
  via the API.
- If you prefer that these users are treated as deactivated instead, just reply with
  'Ask a Person' in a Support Conversation to speak with a Product Support Specialist
  and we can adjust the default setting.

errors:
- '403: The email address being sent from the Active Directory must exactly match
  the email address associated with the user’s Culture Amp profile.'
- '''Connection refused'' error may occur due to internal Firewall blocking the SFTP
  connection.'
- Make sure the hostname and username you use to set up your SFTP client are copied
  directly from the setup form in Culture Amp.
