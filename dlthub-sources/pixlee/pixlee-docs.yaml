notes:
- The API_KEY is required for authentication.
- The parentURL is optional but recommended.
- Ensure that the Pixlee Product Exports job has at least run once before testing.
- If issues arise, check server logs for exceptions and errors.
- It is highly recommended that the 'pixlee_cdn_photos' key is used to return media
  content, as these are cached by our CDN and guaranteed to permanently exist.
- For videos, content_type will be 'video'.
- All widgets require a public API key and widget id.
- Additional optional parameters include lightbox, containerId, subscribedEvents,
  fixedWidth, ecomm_platform, and denyCookies.
- Replace 'Your_API_key' with your Account API Key.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token, requires setup of connected app in Pixlee
- Some hotspots are located outside of the screen. This's not a bug. It's from the
  different screen ratios of mobile devices and the display options which are ImageScaleType's
  [FIT_CENTER, CENTER_CROP].
- FIT_CENTER displays all areas of the image keeping the ratio of the content and
  fill the rest of the screen with a blurry image.
- CENTER_CROP also keeps the ratio of the content. It fills the screen and crops the
  rest of the areas.
- Used for reading data from the API; the key that exists in your user-facing widget
  code
- Used for creating/modifying data via the API; allows you to read some sensitive
  data (such as email addresses)
- Used for signing POST requests when creating data alongside the Private API key
- Events available for subscription include widgetLoaded, photoOpened, photoClosed,
  photoChanged, ctaClicked, ctaChanged, widgetNumPhotos, widgetLoadMore, widgetNavigated,
  uploaderOpened, uploadComplete, socialShare, widgetHidden.
- This event should be fired anytime the user clicks a button to load more Pixlee
  content for 'filmstrip or horizontal' style widgets
- All response objects are accessible under the 'data' key in the response envelope.
- 'POST payloads always include content header ''Content-Type: application/json''.'
- By default, endpoints under distillery.pixlee.co are CDN cached by their full URL,
  with an expiry of 2 minutes.
- A timestamp parameter can be added to refresh this cache on demand, using the parameter
  &unique_id=NUMERIC_TIMESTAMP.
- If there are no images tagged with a product, Pixlee widget would not render and
  would hide itself on the specific page.
- This documentation is only for Pixlee clients using SiteGenesis with Pipelines.
- Ensure that this change goes to production and you're all done!
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Record the value of Account Private API Key to target endpoints
- Most image types, gifs, as well as mp4s are allowed in the photo_uri.
- If the same image is created multiple times, the image properties will not change.
- If you have ever changed the max_execution_time variable for Magento, please ensure
  that it is set to at least 3600 seconds.
- The API_KEY is required for authentication
- parentURL is optional but recommended
- 'All values in double braces: {{ }} depend on your implementation.'
- Filters parameter can include various optional fields such as filter_by_connected_user_ids,
  has_permission, and filter_by_userhandle.
errors:
- Failure to export products may indicate issues with the configuration or job execution.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '429 Too Many Requests: Exceeded the API rate limit of 3600 requests per minute.'
- Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 43148176 bytes)
- 'Fatal error: Maximum execution time of XYZ seconds exceeded in ...'
