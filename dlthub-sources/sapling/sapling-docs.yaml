notes:
- If you're using .NET, this is likely occurring because you haven't set SecurityProtocol
  to TLS 1.2 or above.
- You'll be billed based on usage at the end of the monthly period.
- It may take up to 1 hour for the usage to update.
- Training large ML models in a reasonable amount of time requires that Sapling uses
  graphics processing units (GPUs).
- Each training run requires ~$2000 in compute spend.
- Sapling's API is rate-limited based on the subscription of the API key holder.
- For free trials, the limit is 50,000 characters every 24 hours and 250,000 characters/month.
- For subscribed users, this limit is currently 10 million characters every 24 hours
  and 25 million characters/month.
- Each of these limits can be raised â€“ contact us.
- The rate limit terms of request frequency varies by endpoint.
- For most endpoints, the limit is 120,000 characters every 2 minutes.
- The edits and postprocess endpoints are limited to 240,000 characters every 2 minutes.
- If you ever encounter rate limit errors when using Sapling (usually indicated by
  status code 429), contact support@sapling.ai and we'll see if we can help.
errors:
- Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.
- '429: Rate limit error'
