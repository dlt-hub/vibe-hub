notes:
- 'Access tokens can be issued with four security scopes: READ, WRITE, PAY, READ_SENSITIVE_CARD_DATA.'
- If you enable the READ_SENSITIVE_CARD_DATA scope for your access token, you must
  set up IP whitelisting.
- You must use a transport certificate and its private key in order to request an
  access token.
- Never share your access_token with anyone, as it can be used to access the banking
  data that you have access to and initiate transactions.
- The Create an order endpoint was updated to a new version and now returns token
  as the public identifier for the order.
- Previous integrations might still use the deprecated endpoint returning public_id.
- In the Sandbox environment, you cannot add real people and businesses as Revolut
  counterparties.
- If you are on a freelancer account, to be compliant with PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication
  regulations, you must manually approve the counterparty with 2-factor authentication
  (2FA) on the Revolut Business Portal before you can make a transfer.
- Revolut will retry the webhook event three more times, each with a 10-minute interval.
