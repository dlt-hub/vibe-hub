- Automated Payroll & Compliances | Built for Startups & Enterprises
- Powerful Automation | Smart Dashboard | Integrated Access
- Effortless integration with no coding required for payment buttons.
- Do not share your API Key secret with anyone or on any public platforms.
- While sending API requests to Razorpay servers, it is recommended to honour the
  TTL of the entries and not cache the DNS aggressively at your end. This is applicable
  when you are not using Razorpay SDKs.
- If you are using our SDKs, our SDKs can handle DNS caching and honour the TTLs that
  are set in the records.
- Automated Payroll & Compliances built for Startups & Enterprises
- Offers seamless payment experience on your website or app
- Offers seamless payment experience with multiple methods.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- Razorpay assures you that your Personal Information will not be disclosed publicly
  or sold to any third party.
- Automated tools or scripts ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED
- DDoS/spam attacks are STRICTLY not allowed
- Automated tools or scripts ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED, and any POC submitted to us
  should have a proper step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue.
- We currently do not offer any monetary compensation. However, we may send out Razorpay
  swag in some cases.
- Razorpay uses a request Rate Limiter to limit the number of requests received by
  the API within a time frame.
- While integrating with any APIs, watch for HTTP status code 429 and build the retry
  mechanism based on the requirement.
errors:
- 'HTTP status code 429: Request rate limiter - build retry mechanism based on the
  requirement.'
