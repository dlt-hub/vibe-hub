notes:
- Improvements in the Authentication Process
- Enhance the OAuth authorization with PKCE
- The June release adds support for new aggregation types, such as __count and DISTINCTCOUNT.
- The replaceAll logic for updates is in development.
- Analytic dimensions and tags are now supported throughout accounting entries and
  account setup.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Partners should have a privacy policy which can be accessed from their website.
- Highly sensitive secrets should be stored in a secure manner where access is strictly
  controlled.
- Authentication will fail if you are using a different Sage product or the Sage Business
  Cloud Accounting product for a different locale.
