notes:
- The Log API is disabled by default and is only available upon request.
- We impose limits on the number of API calls an ad account or a user can make within
  a specified timeframe.
- Exceeding these limits results in API requests from one or more users under the
  ad account being throttled.
- Each Workplace will have a quota of the total number of entities that can be created.
- There will be a limitation on the total number of campaigns, apps, creatives, and
  more.
- All creative assets must be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage before you can create
  a creative object.
- An API that lets you upload a creative asset and create a creative object all at
  once will be made available soon.
- Campaign status is set to SUBMITTED by default after creation.
- It usually takes about 2 hours for the ML model for your campaign to finish training.
- Campaign status updates to ACTIVE when enabling_state is set to ENABLED.
- Each workplace has its own access token. To make changes to entities in another
  workplace, you must get a new token for that workplace.
- An access token is valid for 16 hours, and you must create a new token using your
  API key before it expires.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) ver. 1.2 or later is required starting August 4,
  2023
- We strongly advise against specifying multiple API versions across a single organization.
- Report will be available until one month from the date of creation.
