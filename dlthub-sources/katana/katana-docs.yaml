notes:
- The purchase order rows are returned in sorted order, with the most recent rows
  appearing first.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Ensure to provide order_no and customer_id for sales orders
- Quickly respond to webhook requests - If an incoming webhook triggers lengthy processing
  in your system, we recommend you create a processing queue for events.
- Place importance on responsiveness over availability - Your setup only needs to
  acknowledge the webhook request initially but can process it later.
- Deduplicate incoming events - It's essential to include a mechanism that prevents
  duplicated events.
- Each webhook event has an x-sha2-signature header.
- Use the raw event body and don't convert to an object first.
- If an invalid parameter is added to the filter, it won't be applied to the results.
- If no results match a filter, an empty array will be returned.
- You cannot request more than 250 records at a time. If you raise the limit above
  this amount, we will automatically change the limit to 250.
- By default, Katana API allows 60 requests per 60 seconds.
- Once a webhook notification is received, you should acknowledge success by providing
  an HTTP 20X response within 10 seconds.
- If a response isn't delivered within this time, we will attempt to resend the notification
  three more times according to a specific schedule.
- Endpoint deprecation, we recommend using safety_stock instead
- The endpoint accepts up to 150 product operation rows and processes them in bulk.
- If rows are successfully created, 204 is returned.
- This endpoint is deprecated in favor of BOM rows
- The endpoint accepts up to 150 recipe rows and processes them in bulk
- If rows are successfully created, 204 is returned
- Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
- Status updates can take a long time so 204 is returned
- You need to poll if status update has ended (status_update_in_progress) and continue
  after that
- Updates the specified service by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any
  parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
- Manufacturing order production ingredient cannot be updated when the manufacturing
  order status is DONE.
