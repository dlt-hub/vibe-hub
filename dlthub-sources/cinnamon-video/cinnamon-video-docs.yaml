notes:
- Some of these optimization techniques don’t make sense to us and we cannot explain
  them all, but they were tested methodically.
- Jason is the only one in the team to see an impact from them. He’s running a slow
  CPU with multi-monitors and a low-latency kernel with NVIDIA drivers. These were
  tested on Cinnamon 4.0. Performance boosts are witnessed in terms of input lag when
  moving windows and selecting text in Visual Studio Code.
- Reducing the number of listeners has a significant positive impact on performance.
- The impact was significant.
- It makes `setProperty()` slower of course, although that’s usually not critical,
  but it makes the overal project faster.
- The impact wasn’t as significant and this optimization is probably only suited to
  critical paths such as windowmanager.js.
- The impact is positive but subtle and this optimization is probably only suited
  to critical paths such as windowmanager.js.
- Many developers within the team use Sublime.
- If you install Sublime, also install its Package Control and then use it to install
  the GitGutter and TrailingSpaces extensions.
- Visual Studio Code is also very popular within the team.
- gitg is included in mint-dev-tools.
- You don’t need much to get started.
- Developers come from all around the world; but, if you speak English, then you’ll
  be able to work with just about anybody.
- 'If you don’t know about Git, stop right there: you need to learn it.'
- We’re using Github to host our Git repositories and to work together on the code.
- For most projects, you’ll need a computer running the latest version of Linux Mint
  or else the latest version of LMDE.
