  and remove your old user profile. See Mozilla Support for instructions to create

- This is a clusterware issue that occurs only when the Oracle GI version is 12.2.0.1
  without any bundle patch.
- If you use volume group backups when performing DR operations for compute and storage
  across different ADs within the same region, back and forth DR transitions will
  cause the compute and associated block storage (which uses volume group backups)
  to end up in a different AD each time.
- This issue does not affect block storage that is replicated using volume group replication.
- Auto-tune performance settings for block storage volumes are not carried over during
  DR operations.
- For block storage volumes which have auto-tuned performance enabled you must re-enable
  these settings after Full Stack DR transitions these block storage volumes to another
  region.
- If you perform a failover operation immediately after modifying an Full Stack DR-protected
  resource, then the resource recovery may fail, or the resource may not be recovered
  properly.
- Perform a switchover precheck immediately after making any changes to any resources
  under DR protection.
- Full Stack DR uses the Oracle Cloud Agent (OCA) Run Command utility to run local
  scripts on instances.
- On Microsoft Windows instances, the script can only run as the default ocarun userid
  used by the Oracle Cloud Agent Run Command utility.
- On a Microsoft Windows instance, any local script that you configure to run as a
  user-defined step in a DR plan must be accessible and executable by this ocarun
  userid.
- When you configure a user-defined step in a DR plan to run a local script that resides
  on an instance, ensure that you provide the full path to any interpreter that may
  precede the script name, as well as the full path to the script.
- During DR operations, Full Stack DR attempts to reassign the original private IP
  assigned to an instance if the CIDR-block of the destination subnet matches the
  CIDR-block of the source subnet, and if the original private IP of the instance
  is not already assigned.
- Ensure that the destination subnet's CIDR-block matches the CIDR-block of the source
  subnet and all private IP addresses required for cluster nodes are available in
  the destination subnet.
- Ignore this message. SSH connections to the instance will work normally if you use
  the original SSH keyfile to connect to and authenticate the instance.
- This error message is for the display of the Image name but does not affect the
  operation of the instance or its boot volume.
- To start a process in the background, add sleep in the wrapper script.
- After executing a DR plan, configure the performance setting manually.
- The on-demand upload of a zip file which is created on a Windows machine might sometimes
  fail to upload the log content.
- Folders containing more than 10,000 files may cause high resource (memory / storage
  / CPU) usage by the Management Agent.
- We recommend avoiding large folders. Utilize a cleanup mechanism to remove files
  soon after they are collected.
