notes:
- The record button is hidden when opening a videoask in a WebView of my iOS app,
  so it makes it tricky for respondents to answer. How can I solve this?
- This can be fixed by adding a little extra code to your embed code.
- When you delete a videoask, it'll first be transferred to your Trash folder. You
  can Restore it, Delete it forever, or, if you leave it in your Trash folder it'll
  be permanently deleted after 30 days.
- Emails will be sent from a no-reply zapiermail.com address and you’ll be able to
  send up to 10 emails per hour.
- You can have up to 5 recipients in the email and email addresses won’t be bcc’ed.
- A paid VideoAsk plan is required for this setup.
- Before starting, make sure to set all interactions as shareable so people are able
  to view the responses.
- The z-index property sets the stack order of different HTML elements that would
  otherwise overlap on your webpage. The higher the z-index number, the closer to
  the front of your page the element will appear.
- Free plans are available for the tools listed above, but you’ll need a Thinkific
  plan that has API access to use this automation.
- Currently the contact form in VideoAsk collects the respondent’s name in one field.
- Before starting, make sure to set all interactions as shareable so you're able to
  view the files in Google Drive or Dropbox when they're sent across.
- The code snippet above is designed for a videoask with 3 open-ended answer-type
  steps.
- Webhooks are an advanced feature intended for those who know how to work with them.
- The idle deadline time is set to 60 minutes, customizable between 15 and 240 minutes.
- Zapier integration allows automation between VideoAsk and other apps.
- If the trigger event has never happened, submit a test response to enable testing.
- Free plans are available for the tools listed above.
