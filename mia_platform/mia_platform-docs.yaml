  - 'The API requires a client key for authentication. Send the client key in the
    ''client-key'' header with each request. Example: --header ''client-key: client-key''.
    This header is mandatory for POST requests to insert, update, or upsert documents
    in the collection.'
  - 'The API requires a client key for authentication. Send the client key in the
    HTTP header named "client-key" with each request. For example, use curl with the
    header flag -H "client-key: client-key" to authenticate GET requests to the endpoint.'
  - 'The API requires a client key for authentication. Send the client-key header
    with your request, as shown in the export examples where the header "client-key:
    client-key" is included in curl commands.'
  - 'The API uses a custom header-based authentication scheme. Include the header
    `client-key: client-key` in all requests to authenticate. The exact value for
    the client-key should be provided by your API provider.'
  - The documentation shows a required authentication header. Requests must include
    the header client-key with a value (e.g., "client-key") to authenticate API calls.
