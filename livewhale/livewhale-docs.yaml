auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.livewhale.com/live/blurbs/api:
  - $token is an optional authentication token parameter used in the read() function
    to access hidden content or content with certain permissions (LiveWhale 2.0+).
    Pass the token as the third argument to the read() method to authenticate requests
    for restricted resources.
  - 'Authenticated requests to LiveWhale''s REST/RSS/JSON API use time-limited access
    tokens obtained via a token endpoint. Tokens expire hourly and must be refreshed;
    they are passed via the ?lw_auth= query parameter to bypass caching and access
    restricted data or use create/update/delete operations.


    Key details: Access tokens are reset hourly with an expiration time provided upon
    receipt. The application must store both the token and its expiration time, and
    fetch a new token before expiration or requests will be denied. Tokens can authenticate
    either as a specific LiveWhale user (not supported on SSO installations) or as
    an authenticated request without user identity. The token is sent as a query parameter
    named lw_auth.'
  - Authentication tokens can be used for API requests to access hidden content. Add
    an authentication token to your request (details on how to pass it are referenced
    in the API basics documentation on authenticated requests). When logged in to
    LiveWhale or using an authentication token, you can include ?include_hidden=1
    to retrieve hidden results in addition to live content.
  - 'Authentication via token-based system: obtain a token in step 1, then use the
    lw_auth variable in subsequent requests until token expiration, at which point
    a new token must be obtained. For REST API calls, use the format https://yourhost/live/ACTION/TYPE/ID.
    The documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or method
    for passing the lw_auth token in REST requests.'
- information_source; https://support.livewhale.com/live/blurbs/794-api-basics:
  - $token is an optional authentication token passed to the read() function to gain
    access to hidden content or content with certain permissions in LiveWhale 2.0
    and later. The token is used as a parameter in read() requests but no specific
    header name, format, or token acquisition method is documented in this excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.livewhale.com/live/blurbs/745-json-api:

    page, then `?page=[number]` query parameter to specify which page to fetch (page=1,
    page=2, etc.). Response includes total_results, per_page, page, total_pages, and
    results fields to indicate pagination state and navigate pages.
