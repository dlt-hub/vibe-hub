auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.kajabi.com/developers:
  - 'API keys are required for authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token using the format: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY.
    The API key should be obtained from your Kajabi account settings and included
    with every request to the API.'
  - Authentication uses API key scopes to control access to webhook events. Your API
    key must have the required scope for each event type (e.g., view:purchases for
    purchase events, view:contacts for tag events). Webhook creation is restricted
    based on your API key's assigned scopes, with account owner API keys having broader
    permissions like view:contacts.
