  : - Bearer token authentication is required via the Authorization header. A valid
      Bearer Access Token must be provided in the Authorization header; requests without
      it will return a 401 Unauthenticated error.
    - OAuth2 Authentication is used with the client_credentials grant type. Acquire
      a Bearer Access Token by posting to https://auth.eu.customergauge.com/oauth2/token
      with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret as URL-encoded
      form data. Include the token in the Authorization header of API requests. Access
      tokens are valid for up to 1 hour.
