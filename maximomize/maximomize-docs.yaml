auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.maximomize.com/nextgen-rest-api:
  - 'LDAP based authentications are supported via two methods. BASIC authentication
    sends credentials in the Authorization header as base64 encoded user:pass in the
    format "Authorization: BASIC <base64 encoded user:pass>" with a POST to /oslc/login.
    FORM authentication POSTs to /j_security_check with Content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    and form parameters j_username and j_password; the response includes jsessionid
    and Ltpa token cookies that must be reused in subsequent API calls.'
  - Request header x-method-override must be set to PATCH when invoking actions on
    existing resources via POST requests. Actions are invoked by appending query parameter
    action with values like workflow:ABC or wsmethod:methodName to the resource URI.
  - The REST API uses HTTP request headers to authenticate users. For native authentication,
    include a MAXAUTH header with a base64 encoded userid:password value in the format
    userid:password. For LDAP based authentication, BASIC authentication is supported,
    which typically uses the Authorization header with base64 encoded credentials
    in the format Basic base64(userid:password).
