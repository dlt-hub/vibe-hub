notes:
- Due to technical limitations, the conda package does not support GPUs at the moment.
- Uses conda for installation
- The conda package does not support GPUs at the moment
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses a Bayesian approach with Monte Carlo Markov chains.
- The CPU version of galario is always compiled, even on a system without a CUDA-enabled
  GPU.
- On machines with only one CUDA-capable GPU, it is not necessary to call double_cuda.use_GPU(0)
  as this is the default behaviour.
- Setting N_OMP larger than the number of physical cores can lead to performance penalty.
- If galario is to be used in a code that already uses MPI to parallelize the tasks
  over multiple processes, setting double.threads(1) might give a better overall performance.
- Uses GPU Accelerated Library for Analysing Radio Interferometer Observations
- This is the list of Frequently Asked Questions about galario. The list will be updated
  regularly to include the questions about recurring issues and relative solutions.
- 'The translation by (dRA, dDec) and the rotation by PA of the model image are optimized
  for speed: they are not obtained with extra interpolations of the model image, but
  rather applied in the Fourier plane.'
- The offset is achieved by applying a complex phase to the sampled visibilities.
  To rotation is achieved by internally rotating the (u, v) locations by -PA.
