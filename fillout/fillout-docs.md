In this guide, we'll set up a complete Fillout data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def fillout_forms_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.fillout.com/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "forms",
            "forms/{formId}/submissions",
            "webhook/create"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='fillout_forms_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='fillout_forms_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(fillout_forms_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from fillout_forms‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Forms Management: Allows retrieval and management of forms and their metadata.
- Submissions Management: Handles operations related to form submissions, including retrieval, creation, and deletion.
- Webhook Management: Provides endpoints for creating and deleting webhooks.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Fillout workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@fillout_forms-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Fillout support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:fillout_forms duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@fillout_forms-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Fillout API, as specified in @fillout_forms-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "forms" and "forms/{formId}/submissions" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in fillout_forms_pipeline.py and name the pipeline fillout_forms_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python fillout_forms_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    The authentication uses OAuth2 with the token being passed in the header. A client ID and client secret are required for obtaining the access token.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.fillout.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python fillout_forms_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline fillout_forms load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset fillout_forms_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/fillout_forms.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline fillout_forms_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("fillout_forms_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "forms" table as Pandas frame
   data."forms".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Be aware of the rate limit which restricts API calls to no more than 5 times per second per account. Additionally, only paid Softr accounts can use certain features like the custom code block. Data types in forms are regularly updated, and unknown types should be discarded by your application. If hosting Fillout yourself or using the EU agent, a different base URL will be provided in your dashboard.
