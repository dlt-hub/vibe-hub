  : - Checks the HMAC contained in the header. The webhook notification uses HMAC
      signature verification where the secret is configured as "secret", the HMAC
      header name is "x-header-name", and the server listens on a configured URL path
      "/callback/notification" on port 4567. The HMAC signature must be validated
      before processing the JSON payload.

  - API key authentication is required, sent as the `apikey` header in requests. The
    `apikey` value is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests and control
    API usage.
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the HTTP header named
    `apikey` with the value `[APIKEY_VALUE]`. A 401 error is returned if authentication
    is missing, and a 403 error indicates insufficient permissions.
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `apikey` HTTP header
    with each request. The `apikey` header contains the unique API key value used
    to authenticate requests and track API usage.
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `apikey` header with
    each request (e.g., `-H ''apikey: [APIKEY_VALUE]''`). The API key uniquely identifies
    and authenticates requests while tracking API usage. Additionally, responses include
    a `signature` field that can be verified using the Biometric Services public certificate
    for integrity verification.'
