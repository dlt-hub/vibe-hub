notes:
- A valid API key is required to access any of the APIs.
- The API key cannot be retrieved again so make sure to store it in a secure location.
- Each user can only have one API-key
- API-keys have no expiration date
- LISA and Lime Admin only allow the creation of API-keys for API users
- All API-keys must be re-created after changing this setting
- User Provisioning
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Entra ID login for Lime CRM must be enabled and configured
- Not possible to use both Ladi and SCIM for synchronizing user data
- Created groups can not be nested in LISA, SCIM provisioning only supports a flat
  group structure
- Clearing an attribute won't clear the field in CRM
- Lime CRM Webserver handles security, such as certificates and authentication via
  logon via a web form or via an API key.
- A marshmallow schema class name must be unique for entire application.
- Enables the 'select database' feature in the login screen. Set this to true for
  on-premise installations with more than one application.
- Without these headers, the Lime CRM server will assume it is directly accessible,
  potentially generating URLs like 'http://lime-crm/' instead of the correct, externally
  accessible 'https://lime.yourdomain.com/'.
- Logs are organized and accessible via Kibana.
- To find logs to a failing request, search for the request's URL and response.
- If you only know which service is causing the problem, figure out the hostname of
  the service docker container.
errors:
- 'Error creating API key: Please refer to the provided link for more information.'
