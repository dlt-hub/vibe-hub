- Pagination is set to 50 results per page.
- Rate limit is set to 100 queries per minute.
- Bulk download contains a single Excel file with multiple sheets describing each
  of the data types.
- Files are composed of author-reported variants and annotations.
- We are currently working on methods to provide harmonized versions of each PGS in
  different genome builds.
- Harmonized scoring files can be accessed via FTP, in a separate directory for each
  score
- Each scoring file is formatted to be a gzipped tab-delimited text file.
- The bulk download contains a single Excel file with multiple sheets describing each
  of the data types.
- All PGS variants scoring and metadata files are available for download.
- The PGS Catalog and all its contents are made available through the standard EMBL-EBI
  terms of use.
- PGS obtained from the Catalog should be cited appropriately, and used in accordance
  with any licensing restrictions set by the authors.
- Check Terms/Licenses for scoring files
- Metrics are not necessarily comparable with each other.
- Refer to the source publication for additional guidance on performance.
- Performance metrics are displayed as reported by the source studies.
- Scores and related data are available via FTP.
- Freely available to the academic community for research use.
- Metrics are not necessarily comparable with each other due to dependency on sample
  characteristics, phenotyping, and statistical modelling.
- The endpoint supports various sample sets related to stroke.
- Metrics depend on sample characteristics, phenotyping, and statistical modelling.
