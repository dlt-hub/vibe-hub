auth_info:
- information_source; https://sqlkover.com/extracting-data-from-the-planview-portfolios-rest-api-using-adf-introduction/:
  - The Planview Portfolios REST API uses OAuth authentication. A Web activity must
    fetch an OAuth token before making REST API requests. The token is then used to
    authenticate subsequent API calls to retrieve work data for projects. Project
    IDs are obtained from the WorkDimension table in the OData feed, which is queried
    separately to populate the list of projects to iterate through.
- information_source; https://sqlkover.com/planview-portfolios-rest-api-with-adf-fetching-the-access-token/:
  - Planview Portfolios uses OAuth 2.0 with the client credentials grant type. To
    obtain an access token, send a POST request to the OAuth endpoint with grant_type
    set to "client_credentials", client_id, and client_secret as parameters or in
    the request body. The client_id and client_secret are created by a Planview administrator
    in the OAuth Clients menu, and the resulting token inherits the permissions of
    the user who created the client.
- information_source; https://sqlkover.com/execute-fabric-data-pipeline-from-azure-data-factory/:
  - Fabric REST API authentication requires either a service principal or managed
    identity of the ADF instance (managed identity preferred). The service principal
    or managed identity must be added to a security group in Azure Entra ID, that
    group must be enabled in the Fabric Admin portal for REST API access, and the
    principal must be added as a contributor to the workspace. Authentication is performed
    using the service principal or managed identity credentials to obtain an access
    token for the Fabric REST API endpoint.
- information_source; https://sqlkover.com/call-a-fabric-rest-api-from-azure-data-factory/:
  - The API uses managed identity authentication with a POST method to https://api.fabric.microsoft.com.
    A custom header is required (shown in the referenced image, but the specific header
    name and value are not legible in the provided text). The managed identity handles
    credential acquisition automatically without requiring explicit API keys or tokens
    to be manually configured.
  - The Fabric REST APIs require Azure managed identity authentication within a security
    group that has been granted API access in the Fabric Admin portal. The managed
    identity must be added to the target Fabric workspace with appropriate role-based
    permissions (contributor for creating resources, viewer for listing). Requests
    are made to endpoints like https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/lakehouses
    with the managed identity providing the bearer token via Azure's standard token
    acquisition mechanism.
