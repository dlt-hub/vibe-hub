auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.vericlock.com/api/1.0/docs:
  - 'All API requests require four authentication headers: vericlock_api_public_key
    (your API public key in guid format), vericlock_domain (the unique part of your
    access URL), vericlock_authtoken (guid authentication token from authentication
    endpoint, required for all routes except authentication itself), and vericlock_signature
    (HMAC signature). The HMAC signature is generated using the request path (the
    part after hostname and /api prefix), your account''s 16-byte private key in binary
    representation, and the request body string. Additionally, an optional idempotency_key
    header can be provided for request caching with valid characters A-Za-z0-9 dash
    hyphen underscore equals plus and forward slash, cached for 24 hours or longer
    depending on the route.'
  - Authenticate with VeriClock by sending a POST request to https://api.vericlock.com/1.0/auth
    with user (employee email) and password in the JSON body. The response returns
    an authToken that must be used for subsequent API calls.
  - Authentication uses a token-based approach. After login, an authToken is returned
    and must be included in subsequent requests via the HTTP header vericlock_authtoken.
    The token invalidates on logout or due to inactivity.
  - VeriClock API requires an API public key passed in the HTTP header vericlock_api_public_key
    with each request. All API actions are performed in the context of a VeriClock
    user and are restricted by that user's permissions; administrators have full access
    while regular employees have limited access to specific operations like clocking
    in/out.
