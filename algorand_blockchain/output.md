In this guide, we'll set up a complete Algorand data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def algorand_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "http://{API}/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "explorer",
            "nft/marketplace",
            "box/create"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='algorand_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='algorand_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(algorand_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from algorand‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Blockchain Services: Includes endpoints related to blockchain explorations, NFT marketplace operations, and transaction functionalities. 
- Smart Contract Management: Manages smart contracts through endpoints for creating, manipulating, and deleting storage boxes tied to contracts. 
- Randomness Services: Provides access to random values for use within the blockchain context, necessary for certain types of verifications and operations. 
- Development Tools: Specialized tools and environments for smart contract development and testing, including sandbox environments and testing frameworks.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Algorand workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@algorand-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Algorand support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:algorand duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@algorand-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Algorand API, as specified in @algorand-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "explorer" and "nft/marketplace" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in algorand_pipeline.py and name the pipeline algorand_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python algorand_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed via OAuth2, with tokens passed in the header of requests. The header used is 'Authorization'.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.algorand.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python algorand_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline algorand load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset algorand_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/algorand.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline algorand_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("algorand_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "explorer" table as Pandas frame
   data."explorer".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Be aware of the limitations regarding box sizes and the unique naming requirements for boxes within applications. Also, note the opcode budget limitations for smart contract calls and the specific error codes that may be generated when item or asset limits are exceeded. The environment is more suited to development rather than production, with specific security and operational guidelines to follow.
