  the scope.
- Global users have no assigned scope and have unrestricted access to all data.
- Data RBAC doesn't restrict access to IOCs and ATI data specifically.
- Global data access overrides scoped data access, if both are assigned.
- If you enable Data RBAC before assigning in scopes, only users with global access
  will be able to view data.
- If you enable Data RBAC after setting up and assigning scopes, scoped users will
  immediately have access to scoped data.
- Once Data RBAC is enabled using the Enforce data access button, the only way to
  turn off Data RBAC is to open a support ticket.
- Ensure when you turn on Data RBAC, you are ready to turn it on.
- Data RBAC is critical for security within the Google SecOps platform.

  option.
- This example is for demonstration only, as UDM requires repeated fields to be structured.
- It's vital to remember that even if your log data contains a single value for a
  field, if the UDM schema defines that field as repeated (e.g., principal.ip), your
  parser must construct a repeated field structure.
- The merge clause appends values to JSON objects.
- Failing to clear temp completely after appending it, or incorrectly clearing only
  temp.tag, will corrupt the 'tags' list, causing duplication.

  'Base64 Output' parameter.
- If you want to save the file to the case wall, then you need to enable the 'Save
  To Case Wall' parameter.

- Uses additional.fields to provide flexibility in mapping
- GoStash allows you to build hierarchical structures in your output.
- This example shows one of the core patterns used in UDM Mapping to handle repeated
  nested fields.
- Every UDM event necessitates a value for the 'Metadata.event_type' field.
- Avoid Deprecated Fields
- Fields like data.error, data.action, etc. are considered 'Recurring' fields. They
  will only exist in specific log messages depending on the log type.
- Fields like timestamp, source, eventType are considered 'Mandatory' fields. They
  will exist in ANY log regardless of its type.
- Uses placeholders for repeated fields.
- Some UDM fields may have non-repeating and repeating structures.
- Uses JSON logs for schema inference
- EventType is the main marker for identifying log categories
- Recursively analyzing your schema based on each different value for eventType will
  give you the schema per log type.

  in your log samples to build your parser properly.
