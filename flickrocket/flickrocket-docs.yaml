auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flickrocket.com/en/rest-api/introduction/:
  - FlickRocket uses OAuth 2.0 as its primary authentication mechanism for apps to
    access shop data through the REST API. When a shop installs your app, it grants
    permission to access their shop's data via OAuth 2.0 authorization.
- information_source; https://developer.flickrocket.com/en/rest-api/oauth/:
  - Bearer token authentication via HTTP Authorization header. Access tokens are validated
    at the tokeninfo endpoint and support scopes including products, customers, orders,
    themes, files, companies, statistics, and webhooks. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}" or optionally as a query parameter access_token={access_token},
    though the header is preferred to avoid server log visibility. Validate tokens
    using GET https://api.flickrocket.com/api/tokeninfo?access_token={access_token},
    which returns user_id, scope, expires_in (in seconds), and access_type. Possible
    validation errors are expired, access_token required, or invalid access_token.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Redirect users to https://api.flickrocket.com/oauth2/auth
    with query parameters: client_id (app''s client ID), scope (comma-separated list
    of requested scopes like "products", "orders", "customers"), access_type set to
    "offline", and redirect_uri (must match a registered Application Redirect URL).
    After user authorization, the authorization server redirects to your redirect_uri
    with a code parameter, which is then exchanged for an access_token.'
  - 'OAuth2 refresh token flow with bearer token authentication. Exchange refresh_token
    via POST to https://api.flickrocket.com/token with grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token,
    and client_id as query parameters. The response contains an access_token with
    expiration info and a new refresh_token that must be stored permanently. Include
    the access_token in subsequent API requests either as Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
    header (preferred) or as access_token query parameter.'
  - The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Apps must obtain user permission before
    accessing REST API resources through an OAuth authorization process as specified
    in the OAuth 2.0 specification.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flickrocket.com/en/rest-api/api-reference/product/:
  - Use the `since_id` query parameter to retrieve products after a specified ID.
    This appears to be a cursor-based pagination approach where `since_id` filters
    results to only those with IDs greater than the specified value.
