auth_info:
- information_source; https://myark.github.io/parse-doc-zh/parse-server/guide/:
  - Parse Server requires the X-Parse-Application-Id header to be sent with REST API
    requests. Replace APPLICATION_ID with your actual application identifier value
    in the X-Parse-Application-Id header for both POST and GET requests.
- information_source; https://myark.github.io/parse-doc-zh/rest/guide/:
  - Authentication for the apps endpoint uses account credentials via headers instead
    of app keys. Send the X-Parse-Email header with your account email and X-Parse-Password
    header with your account password. Alternatively, you can use the X-Parse-Account-Key
    header with a generated Parse account key instead of the password header. If your
    account has no password set due to social login, set one at your account page
    first.
  - 'Authentication is done via HTTP headers: the X-Parse-Application-Id header identifies
    the application, and the X-Parse-REST-API-Key header authenticates the endpoint.
    Alternatively, basic HTTP authentication can be used with the format https://myAppID:javascript-key=myJavaScriptKey@api.parse.com.'
  - 'Authentication requires two custom headers: X-Parse-Application-Id (set to your
    APPLICATION_ID) and X-Parse-Master-Key (set to your MASTER_KEY). Both headers
    must be included in all requests to the webhook API endpoints.'
  - 'Authentication requires two headers: X-Parse-Application-Id (set to APPLICATION_ID)
    and X-Parse-Master-Key (set to MASTER_KEY). These must be included in all requests
    to the Parse API endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://myark.github.io/parse-doc-zh/rest/guide/:
  - Pagination uses limit and skip parameters as query string parameters. limit restricts
    the number of results returned per request, and skip offsets the starting position
    for pagination. Use skip with limit to retrieve subsequent pages by incrementing
    the skip value.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with limit and skip query parameters. The
    limit parameter (default appears to be a standard value, max 200 shown in example)
    controls the number of results per request, and skip parameter specifies the offset
    for the next page. Continue paginating by incrementing skip by the limit value
    until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - 'limit and skip parameters enable pagination. limit (query parameter) sets the
    maximum number of results per request (example shows limit=200), and skip (query
    parameter) specifies how many results to skip before returning data (example shows
    skip=400). Combine these to paginate: increment skip by limit value for each subsequent
    request.'
