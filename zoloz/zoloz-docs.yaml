notes:
- This guide, using RealID as an example, demonstrates how to buy and create ZOLOZ
  products online.
- This document is specifically for customers who place orders through the ZOLOZ official
  website, providing them with billing settlement guidance.
- Real ID supports automatic and manual capture methods.
- Uses automatic capture for better user experience
- CN Authority exploits facial recognition and information comparison technologies
  of Trusted Identity Authentication System.
- The Operation Level specifies the operation mode where the identity proofing process
  runs.
- Contact the ZOLOZ BD team and provide your email address to obtain the H5 Demo link.
- Understand environments and service endpoints
- Understand integration modes
- Get API credentials ready for use
- Integrate the ZOLOZ gateway
- Allow 15–20 minutes for a newly created or updated key to propagate and become active.
- 'Supports two gateway connection methods: public/private key access and AK/SK access.'
- For tracing purpose, it is recommended to use a global unique id.
- Ensure sensitive information such as captured face image is only returned to the
  merchant server.
- It's strongly recommended that you upgrade to the latest SDK for optimal product
  experience and enhanced security.
- Sensitive information such as captured face image is only returned to the merchant
  server.
- ZOLOZ enforces a maximum volume of API requests at the same time for all clients.
- Unless contractually agreed otherwise, the maximum volume is 5.
- Only RSA256 is accepted for signing a request.
- Only RSA_AES is accepted for encrypting a request.
- ZOLOZ services require the validation of the signature for each request message.
- ZOLOZ provides separate sandbox and production environments.
- Postman is not currently supported.
- The default capture times target general scenarios. Server and policy controls can
  change the actual capture time to fit different business needs.
- To ensure consistency in the format of date fields, ZOLOZ has introduced new fields
  prefixed with 'STANDARDIZED_'.
- The above features require the Native SDK to be upgraded to the latest version
- On PC, the Face Guide page is a non-customizable standard template.
- Optional. Specifies whether expired documents are allowed.
- If a value other than Y or N is provided, the system will return `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- This API is not idempotent.
- The ZOLOZ initialize API is used to initialize the ID recognition process.
- The ZOLOZ initialize API is used to initialize the ID recognition process in ZOLOZ.
- The URL for the customized web page must be HTTPS
- The AML Portal has been upgraded and merged with the EKYC Portal, allowing customers
  who purchase both products to switch between different portals within the same account.
- The above features require the Native SDK to be upgraded to the latest version.
- During the upgrade, there may be intermittent service unavailability for up to 5
  seconds.
- Customers can customize those configurations in the Portal's UI Configuration page.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Passport validity verification is enabled by default.
- Real ID product supports double-sided captures for IDs.
- Kindly pay attention to the newly added OCR result key for Thailand IDs in the checkresult
  API response.
- For the Philippines' health cards and driver licenses, if the OCR field value and
  format do not meet the verification requirements, the user will be prompted to take
  their ID photo again.
- To better meet your needs, we are optimizing the nationality field output to present
  information more intuitively for easier understanding and use.
- This adjustment primarily concerns the display format of the nationality field and
  will not affect other business data.
- 'To improve the document verification experience, our analysis of recent pass rate
  data has identified a key issue: mismatches between the selected document type and
  the document provided by the user.'
- The next update adds a sample diagram above the capture frame by default.
- If you enforce security checks on redirect domain names during Web SDK integration
  and do not add the backup domain names to your white list, the change will not take
  effect.
- To provide you with a superior and more efficient service experience, we will upgrade
  the Android SDK to version 2.0.3.
- According to the latest Google Play policy, you must complete the upgrade by November
  1, 2025.
- ZOLOZ has received customer feedback indicating that the current system's error
  message pop-ups are too generic and do not provide users with effective operational
  guidance.
- The changes began on May 19, 2025, and are expected to be completed by June 30,
  2025.
- To ensure the optimized features take effect correctly, customers need to upgrade
  SDK and update the Portal-UI Configuration File.
- ZOLOZ updates the expiration judgment logic for the Hong Kong old version ID card
  (docType=08520000001) under the allowExpiredDocument parameter.
- To enhance the standardization and consistency of OCR recognition results, ZOLOZ
  plans to standardize the output field names of OCR, covering fields such as ID,
  name, gender, date, nationality, issuing country, and address.
- Given the wide variety of document types involved in current OCR recognition, ZOLOZ
  will complete the standardization of field formats in three phases.
- Standardizes OCR output field names in three phases.
- Phase Two changes began on April 6, 2025, and are expected to complete by May 6,
  2025.
- To enhance the standardization and consistency of OCR recognition results, ZOLOZ
  plans to standardize the output field names of OCR.
- This document introduces the future standardized format for OCR output fields, covering
  date, address, and name fields.
- Other fields will remain consistent with the information on the document without
  additional processing.
- ZOLOZ will notify the details of the change through Release Notes in advance.
- If you wish to further process or customize the content output by ZOLOZ, you will
  need to handle this on your own as ZOLOZ will no longer provide such customization
  services in the future.
- 'Upgrade window: From 3rd September to 5th September, the Indonesia / Singapre /
  Hongkong sites will be upgraded.'
- 'Upgrade impact: In order to further improve service performance and stability,
  ZOLOZ will be performing a database optimization.'
- During the upgrade period, please take note that network jitter may occur and some
  API requests may also timeout.
- We recommend that you adjust to the temporary interruption of our services.
- 'Target users should update their ProGuard rules by adding the following rule in
  file `app/proguard-rules.pro` to ensure the normal operation of their business:
  -keep class com.zoloz.zcore.facade.common.** { *; }'
- If target users fail to update ProGuard rules before upgrading Gradle, it may cause
  application crashes when they upgrade Gradle to 7.4.2 or higher versions.
- The planned maintenance on 20th August - 22nd August is cancelled.
- We apologise for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for your kind understanding.
- The product features and business processes are unaffected by this technical architecture
  upgrade.
- You may notice an additional return `deeperResult` parameter in the checkresult
  v1a output.
- Due to Mozilla updating its root certificate trust policy, which requires all globally
  trusted CA root certificates to be replaced at least every 15 years, some of DigiCert's
  old root certificates will be gradually upgraded to DigiCert Global Root G2 starting
  from August 18, 2024.
- This change will take effect since May 31,2024
- All existing keys in the API will be retained, causing no compatibility issue.
- For document type that only supports input of one page, the input of 1,2 for pages
  is intercepted.
- Failure to input the right pages parameter value will result in failed initialization,
  preventing the initiation of eKYC verification.
- This topic describes the ZOLOZ eKYC SaaS planned maintenance on Dec 17, 2023.
