pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.boataround.com:
  - The API uses offset-limit pagination. Request parameters are skip (integer, default
    0, in query) to skip results and limit (integer, default 18, range 1-50, in query)
    to specify the number of results per page. The response contains a data array
    with boat objects. Continue pagination by incrementing skip by the limit value
    until fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - The endpoint supports a limit query parameter (1-50, default 18) to control result
    set size, but no pagination navigation fields (next, cursor, offset, page) are
    documented in the response, making it unclear how to paginate beyond the initial
    limited results.
  - The endpoint supports a limit query parameter (integer, range 1-50, default 18)
    to control the number of results returned. No other pagination mechanisms such
    as offset, cursor, page numbers, or continuation tokens are described.
  - The endpoint supports limit as an optional query parameter (default 18, range
    1-50) to control the number of results returned. No other pagination mechanism
    like offset, cursor, page, or continuation tokens is described.
  - The endpoint uses a limit query parameter (integer, 1-50, default 18) to control
    result size. The response returns a data array with no pagination fields or next/previous
    indicators, suggesting a single fixed-size result set rather than true pagination.
