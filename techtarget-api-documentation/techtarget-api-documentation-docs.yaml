- Agentic AI isn't the only way businesses can automate workflows.
- The landscape for agentic frameworks and platforms is still in its early stages
  of development.
- Agentic architecture enables high levels of modularity and flexibility in AI systems.
- Orchestration can use and reuse different components for a wider range of tasks.
- Agentic architectures don't affect or ensure data quality -- garbage in still yields
  garbage out. Data science teams must work to ensure complete, accurate, relevant
  and bias-free data using comprehensive governance strategies.
- Vast data sets must be protected to ensure that sensitive business data, especially
  personally identifiable information, is safeguarded from unauthorized access, tampering
  or theft.
- Agentic AI introduces new ethical concerns including diminished human oversight,
  privacy erosion, and misaligned outcomes.
- Ethical AI's future is about building human-in-the-loop intelligence designed with
  transparency and override options.
- IBM focuses on the enterprise by making its WatsonX platform customizable for different
  cloud environments and applications.
- The platform currently has 150 prebuilt agents across enterprise departments including
  HR, sales, procurement, IT and customer service.
- It can also be integrated with more than 80 enterprise applications and systems
  such as Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Adobe and Microsoft.
- NLP is expected to become more accurate with more sophisticated models.
- NLP will continue to be an important part of both industry and everyday life.
- MongoDB awakened early to the rapid rise of generative AI and moved quickly to incorporate
  the new technology into its database platforms.
- Vector search is critical to building and using GenAI applications.
- AI factories require a lot of energy.
- Nvidia is putting the GPUs in the factory closer together to reduce power demands.
- The 32k limit supports extended conversations and multimodal tasks but restricts
  very long dialogues or enterprise document processing.
- Enterprise-grade security and privacy features.
- IPA is designed to assist human workers by doing manual, repetitive and routine
  tasks that were previously performed by humans.
- IPA builds upon the base of RPA software, often integrating features like AI, ML,
  NLP and machine vision.
- Assistive technology includes a wide range of tools and services.
- AI is increasingly integrated into assistive technology devices.
- Gemma is available for commercial usage and distribution.
- Gemma is pretrained on a diverse set of English-language web text documents.
- Ataccama One Agentic aims to substantially reduce data preparation time.
- The platform appears to address potential enterprise concerns about automated data
  governance through several safeguards.
- Snowflake Openflow automates data ingestion and integration from disparate sources.
- Snowflake Intelligence enables deep data exploration and analysis using natural
  language.
- New capabilities designed to instill confidence in moving AI agent projects from
  pilots to secure production
- A successful risk management plan helps enterprises identify, plan for and mitigate
  potential risks.
- This API provides access to a collection of podcast episodes.
- Collaboration tools pose new threats to security.
- BDR does not replace EDR, CASB or network controls. Rather, BDR complements them
  by supplying more comprehensive browser-level context and control that other tools
  can't reliably capture.
- Confidential computing secures data in use by creating secure enclaves.
- Includes password-related best practices in enterprise trainings.
- Inform employees to notify their manager and the IT department if they suspect their
  credentials have been compromised.
- The U.S. Cyber Trust Mark aims to validate IoT devices that meet a certain security
  threshold.
- The program has said it expects to begin accepting applications for certification
  from IoT device makers by 2026.
- Organizations should expect a complete PQC migration to be a multiyear effort.
- Consider PQC from a business impact perspective — not just the technical aspects
  of implementing new cryptographic algorithms.
- Organizations could combine PQC encryption standards and QKD to enhance security.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Gophish uses SQLite by default, MySQL is recommended for larger organizations.
- Research shows traditional cybersecurity training methods are largely ineffective.
- Effective programs focus on behavioral change rather than just awareness.
- arp-scan delivers a fast, focused scan of an organization's local subnet.
- arp-scan is limited to the local subnet.
- arp-scan does not attempt to hide from intrusion detection systems or other scan
  prevention tools.
- ARP traffic, however, is a normal part of networking, so other communications could
  camouflage your scan.
- Uses arp-scan in any scenario where detecting network nodes is crucial but hiding
  your actions is not.
- External API integrations are critical, but so is managing third-party API risks
  to maintain customer trust, remain compliant and ensure long-term operational resilience.
- This tutorial covers how to install PuTTY and configure key-based authentication.
- Effective application security requires a layered approach that combines multiple
  testing methods.
- Embed these tools into development workflows where they provide maximum value with
  minimal friction.
- Masking allows software developers, software testers, software application trainers
  and data analysts to work with an organization's data without putting confidential
  information at risk or violating compliance regulations designed to protect personally
  identifiable information (PII).
- Masked data is considered to be a pseudonymized data de-identification technique
  because the altered data does not replace the true data values.
- Data masking is not a simple, one-step process because sensitive fields need to
  be transformed to prevent re-identification while still preserving the structure,
  data types and statistical properties of the original data set.
- Maintaining referential integrity for masked data can be a major challenge.
- Masked values should remain consistent across related systems and tables.
- Best practices for data masking should be included in an organization's data management
  and security policies.
- Questions cover various topics related to preventing cybersecurity incidents.
- Implement robust monitoring of AI input-output activity using anomaly-detection
  tools tailored to your AI systems.
- Training, training, training. You do not have the skills in your house to make the
  AI work in the ways I think you want it to work.
- Ransomware attacks are increasing, especially affecting small organizations.
- Small organizations may not have the resources to counter ransomware effectively.
- Data includes victims that did not pay the ransom.
- Majority of victims are privately owned businesses.
- Data breaches can occur due to various causes including cyberattacks and human error.
- Organizations are often legally required to notify affected individuals after a
  breach.
- Requires setup of connected app in DOGE API
- Some endpoints may have strict rate limits
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in cybersecurity.gov
- Antivirus software is designed to prevent, detect, search and remove viruses and
  other types of malware.
- Typically installed on a computer as a proactive approach to cybersecurity.
- No antivirus program can offer detection and protection against all threat vectors.
- The ability to test software offline is important before putting a system into production.
- Antivirus software can mitigate certain ransomware attacks, but it can't stop or
  remove ransomware once it's taken control of a system.
- Stealth viruses are one of the most dangerous modern cybersecurity threats.
- Proper validation helps protect critical data from corruption.
- Information security protects sensitive information for organizations, including
  customer records, employee details, confidential business information and trade
  secrets.
- Inadequate security measures can expose businesses to serious risks such as financial
  loss, reputational damage, regulatory fines and even the breakdown of essential
  operations.
- Don't assume an integrated GRC program will benefit the company; it might not.
- Don't assume senior management will quickly embrace a GRC program.
- Don't assume employees will embrace a GRC program, especially if it means changing
  the way they've performed their work over the years.
- Don't forget to examine the different approaches to a GRC program; consider a maturity
  model.
- When determining whether an integrated GRC approach will work, don't conduct a minimalist
  examination and analysis of business processes; understand the business as much
  as possible.
- Don't hesitate to contact other organizations to see if their GRC approach worked;
  this is especially important if GRC software is being considered.
- Don't fail to collaborate with IT throughout the project.
- Don't assume employees and management will attend awareness and training sessions;
  this is where management support can help.
- Don't ignore the importance of having a project plan for the GRC system implementation.
- Don't get upset if management decides to defer or cancel the program.
- Enterprise communications security is a growing risk.
