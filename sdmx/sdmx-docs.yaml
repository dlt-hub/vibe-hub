notes:
- Mix-in class for objects with a compare() method.
- SDMX-REST API v1.5.0 corresponds to version 2.1 of the overall SDMX standards.
- The code in this module does not perform calculations or operations on data using
  the parsed structure expressions.
- User code should use the returned information to determine which operations should
  be performed.
- Uses SDMX-REST web service for data queries
- Uses requests library for HTTP connections
- Supports caching with requests_cache if installed
- SDMX datasets often require specific query keys for optimal performance.
- Parsing datetimes may reduce performance for large datasets.
- sdmx raises only HTTP errors with status code between 400 and 499.
- Codes >= 500 do not raise an error as the SDMX web services guidelines define special
  meanings to those codes.
- 'Changed in version 2.15.0: The base URL of this source changed from https://www.ilo.org/sdmx/rest
  to https://sdmx.ilo.org/rest.'
- Each SDMX web service provides a subset of the full SDMX feature set, so the same
  request made to two different sources may yield different results, or an error message.
- The web service has some non-standard behaviour; see [#82](https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/issues/82).
- 'Changed in version 2.15.0: Sometime before 2024-04-26, the base URL of this source
  changed from https://www.ilo.org/sdmx/rest to https://sdmx.ilo.org/rest.'
- The 'SDMX query builder' at the above URL reflects the change, but the documentation
  still shows the old URL, and there does not appear to have been any public announcement
  about the new URL, retirement of the old URL, etc.
- Supports preview_data and series-key based key validation.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some data providers may not fully comply with SDMX standards.
- Any data source that generates SDMX 2.1 messages is supported.
- Default directory for local copy of sdmx-test-data is /home/docs/.cache/sdmx/test-data
- 'Deprecated since version 2.23.0: Use Comparable.compare() or compare() instead.'
errors:
- 'FileNotFoundError: if schema_dir (or a subdirectory) does not contain SDMXMessage.xsd'
- 'NotImplementedError: if msg contains valid XML, but with a root element that is
  not part of the SDMX-ML standard'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- 'NotImplementedError: Attempt to query an unsupported endpoint.'
- 'HTTPError: Bad syntax in the request.'
