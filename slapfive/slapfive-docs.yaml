notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in SlapFive
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Upload headshots of your members that are squared - LinkedIn photos are always squared
- Company logos should be transparent background and horizontal format
- Salesforce Contact creates/updates SlapFive Member
- Salesforce Account creates/updates SlapFive Company
- To protect the security and privacy of your Airtable data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration
  eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Personal Access Token
  (PAT).
- ChurnZero API requires OAuth2 setup for access
- Make sure to handle token expiration properly
- The login data is encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.
- This section describes SlapFive's integration points with Eloqua.
- Accessing the Referral Form doesn't require your customers to log in to an app or
  portal, so any customer can submit a referral, not just your advocates.
- You can link to the Referral Form from anywhere, including your customer community,
  customer newsletters, email campaigns, blog posts.
- Your Referral Form automatically creates a Lead/Contact record in your Marketing
  Automation platform so there's no integration required between the two.
- Connection type set to Cloud
- Use custom TLS/SSL certificate settings set to No
- Requires setup of connected app in Gradual
- 'Grant permission to Vanilla to access the SlapFive domain by going to Technical
  > Security, and in the Trusted Domains box, copy and paste this string: *.slapfive.com'
- The integration uses Zapier to post new or updated customer content in SlapFive
  to Highspot.
- The Highspot Zapier integration is a Private integration.
- Requires API Credentials Key and Secret from User Settings > Developer
- To protect the security and privacy of your HubSpot data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration
  eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your authentication credentials.
- SlapFive makes it simple for you to create and publish customer content that salespeople
  love, because it is aligned with the questions, fears and doubts of your buyers.
- 'OAuth2 scopes: seismic.library.manage seismic.library.view'
- 'Token settings: Use Access Token'
- Requires OAuth2 with a valid token for posting messages.
- Ensure to handle rate limiting appropriately
- Responses to specific UserEvidence questions can contain valuable insights.
- Integration allows for automated workflows based on customer responses.
- The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.
- These instructions describe how to set up the SlapFive app in Okta in the most standard
  way.
- If your company has configured Okta in more advanced ways, you will need to go to
  Okta for support on how to set up this SSO.
- Send the Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL and the X.509 Certificate to your
  SlapFive coach so we can load them into SlapFive's authentication server.
- These instructions describe how to set up the SlapFive app in Entra ID in the most
  standard way.
- Send the SAML Signing Certificate file and the Single Sign-On URL to your SlapFive
  coach.
- Determine the Cloudflare Access Groups you'll use and make sure each User who you
  want to have access to SlapFive belongs to one of those Access Groups.
- If you want dedicated Access Groups for granting SlapFive access, we suggest giving
  them a prefix like SlapFive-CSM.
- The SlapFive Salesforce App must also use Okta as the IDP
