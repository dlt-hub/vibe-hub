auth_info:
- information_source; https://dasch.cfa.harvard.edu/dr7/web-apis/:
  - 'API authentication uses a 40-character API key passed in the x-api-key header.
    The key must be included in all requests as x-api-key: [your_40_character_api_key].
    Development servers at https://api.dev.starglass.cfa.harvard.edu/ have additional
    IP address restrictions for DASCH team members only.'
  - 'The Starglass API offers two tiers: a public API with no authentication and lower
    rate limits, and a registered API requiring authentication with higher rate limits.
    The registered API requires a Starglass API key sent as the `x-api-key` HTTP header.
    The API key is a 40-character alphanumeric string obtained from your user account
    settings after creating a Starglass account and signing in at https://starglass.cfa.harvard.edu/signin.
    The key should be treated as a secret. The public API base URL is `https://api.starglass.cfa.harvard.edu/public/`
    and the registered API base URL is `https://api.starglass.cfa.harvard.edu/full/`.'
