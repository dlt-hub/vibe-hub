auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.archibus.com/system/Content/rest/explore_test.htm:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with Client Credentials grant type. Required values are Access
    Token URL, Client ID, and Client Secret obtained from the authorization provider.
    Send a request to the Access Token URL with these credentials to obtain an access
    token, which is then used for API authentication.
  - Web Central REST APIs require OAuth2 authentication using the Client Credentials
    grant type. To obtain an access token in Postman, select Grant Type as Client
    Credentials, provide the Access Token URL, Client ID, and Client Secret from your
    authorization provider (e.g., Okta), and request the token. The access token should
    then be included in subsequent API requests.
- information_source; https://help.archibus.com/system/Content/rest/overview.htm:
  - Web Central REST APIs use OAuth2-compliant Identity Provider authentication. Applications
    must authenticate with the Identity Provider to obtain an access token, then pass
    that token when calling Web Central REST APIs. The specific header name, parameter
    name, and token acquisition details are not provided in this documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.archibus.com/system/Content/rest/rest_api_doc.htm:
  - 'Pagination is controlled via optional query parameters: offset (number of records
    to skip, default 0) and limit (maximum records to return per request). The response
    includes a total field indicating the total number of records available. Continue
    requesting with incremented offset values until the number of returned records
    is less than the limit or offset exceeds total.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageStart (0-based index of first row, required)
    and pageSize (number of rows to fetch, optional, 0 fetches all rows). To paginate,
    increment pageStart by the previous pageSize value and repeat the request with
    the same pageSize.
