notes:
- 'Warning: When using a port in the request, add a trailing slash if no path is provided.'
- This method does not call httpretty.core.reset() automatically.
- 'Warning: after calling this method the original socket is replaced with httpretty.core.fakesock.'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When using the forcing_headers option make sure to add the header Content-Length
  otherwise calls using requests will try to load the response endlessly.
- HTTPretty uses GNU Make as default build tool.
errors:
- 'UnmockedError: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
