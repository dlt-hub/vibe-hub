  - 'Vault uses token-based authentication via the X-Vault-Token header. Include your
    Vault token in the X-Vault-Token header for all API requests, for example X-Vault-Token:

  - Vault uses token-based authentication. Credentials are passed via the `X-Vault-Token`
    header in HTTP requests. The token value is a unique identifier (e.g., `f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6`)
    that must be included in every API request to authenticate and authorize access
    to paths based on the token's associated policy.
