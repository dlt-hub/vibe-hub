notes:
- Cybersecurity is a broad term but is based on three fundamental concepts known as
  'The CIA Triad'.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Limited support to the hybrid environment: Because SCCM was designed primarily
  for Windows systems, updates and functionality is centered on Windows.'
- 'High costs to adopt: SCCM is typically sold as a component of a bigger toolkit
  from Microsoft and is pricey for non-enterprise businesses.'
- Provides access to essential crypto data without asking for a dime.
- Users can obtain data for more than 12,000 cryptos listed on 500+ exchanges.
- Supports one-click fake customized data generation with faker.js
- Ideal for collaborative work as it lets you share and clone projects
- API marketplaces provide wider exposure for API providers.
- Developers can find and compare various APIs easily.
- SoapUI is designed for SOAP APIs but now supports REST API testing.
- Postman was originally designed for REST APIs but now supports SOAP API testing.
