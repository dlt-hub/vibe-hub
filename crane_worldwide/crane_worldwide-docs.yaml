- information_source; https://developers.craneww.com/api/documentation/openapi/craneapi.json:
  - Crane Worldwide API uses a secret API key for authentication that must be passed
    with each request. The key is obtained by registering on the API portal, requesting
    access, and receiving it via email; it should be stored securely and included
    with every API call.
  - 'The API uses a secret API key that must be passed with each request. The key
    is received via email upon account signup and is specific to each developer and
    company. An authorization header is required; requests without it return a 401
    Unauthorized error, and requests with an invalid key return a 403 Forbidden error.


    Key technical details: The authorization header is mandatory for all requests.
    Pass the secret API key via an authorization header (exact header name and format
    not explicitly specified in the provided documentation, but referenced as "authorization
    header" in error descriptions). Store the key securely and do not share it with
    other developers.'
