- The serve command would truncate all the blocks previously generated and regenerate
  a new genesis block.
- Uses default keyring-backend 'test' for convenience
- The serve command truncates all previously generated blocks and regenerates a new
  genesis block
- New local state sync commands introduced in v1.0.12 to manage snapshots.
- Uses Nix for building binaries locally.
- Currently, this solution is only recommended for archive and non-validator nodes
  to try (validator nodes are recommended to do pruning).
- Different implementations exist for VersionDB. Our current implementation is based
  on RocksDB's v7's experimental user-defined timestamp, which stores the data in
  a standalone RocksDB instance. it does not support other db backends yet.
- Does not support eth_getProof, non-grpc / abci_query for the historical versions
  that's pruned in IAVL tree. The other APIs should function just like an archive
  node as before.
- The migration process will try to parallelize the tasks as much as possible, and
  hence will use significant RAM memory.
- 'Time taken: around 4 days (512G RAM, r6g.16xlarge) for an archive node'
- 'Time taken: around 1 hour for verification'
- 'Time taken: around 1 hour for building VersionDB'
- Currently the solution is only recommended for archive and non-validator nodes to
  try.
- Different implementations exist for VersionDB. Our current implementation is based
  on RocksDB's v7's experimental user-defined timestamp, which stores the data in
  a standalone RocksDB instance.
- The db instance is placed at $NODE_HOME/data/versiondb directory. Currently this
  path cannot be customized.
- Anyone that has been running archive nodes for a while, is familiar with the issue
  of the ever growing disk size of their nodes.
- A solution that we have come up with is to replace the current RocksDB with VersionDB.
- VersionDB stores multiple versions of on-chain state key-value pairs, without using
  a merkelized tree structure like IAVL tree, making both DB size and query performance
  much better than IAVL trees.
- Currently the --grpc-only flag for one to start a standalone grpc query service.
- After migrating to VersionDB, you can then prune the IAVL tree to reclaim disk size
  if you don't need to generate Merkle proofs on historical versions.
- Memiavl is a drop-in replacement for the current iavl implementation, offering a
  huge performance boost for the node.
- Memiavl can be enabled by turning on the memiavl.enable config item in the app.toml.
- MemIAVL only supports pruned nodes, the default configuration should be set equivalent
  to pruning=everything.
- In order to support historical grpc queries, enable versiondb together with memiavl.
- 'WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL'
- Memiavl only supports pruned nodes.
- The default configuration should be set equivalent to pruning=everything.
- Memiavl is a drop-in replacement for the current iavl implementation, offering a

- To patch 'unlucky' transactions, follow this guide on patching unlucky tx.
- Requires authentication setup for API access
- Rate limits apply to API requests
- Only in case of state-sync enabled.
- Note that size of snapshots will keep growing.
- If you have joined cronostestnet_338-2 before, you would have to clean up the old

- This page is for building and running the latest development version of the chain
  for testing purpose only.
- You should expect a moderate amount of troubleshooting work is required.
- Blocks are now being generated! You can view the blockchain data by the rpc port
  of the awesome0 (first node)
- The serve command would truncate all the blocks previously generated and regenerate
  a new genesis block, which means you'll also lose all of your transaction records.
- The logging format can be json or plain.
- The logging level can be trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, or panic.
- This handbook is your kickstart and single source of truth as a Cronos Ambassador.
- To keep the tarball redistributable, it has all the runtime dependencies included.
- Currently, this solution is only recommended for archive and non-validator nodes
  to try.
- Time taken for migration process can be significant, around 4 days for an archive
  node with 512G RAM
- Different implementations exist for VersionDB. Our current implementation is based
  on RocksDB's v7's experimental user-defined timestamp.
- Does not support eth_getProof, non-grpc / abci_query for the historical versions
  that's pruned in IAVL tree.
- 'Time taken: around 1 hour'
- 'Time taken: around x hour'
- However, VersionDB does not perform root hash and Merkle proof generation, so for
  those features we still need the IAVL tree.
- Grpc queries don't need to support proof generation, so VersionDB alone is enough
  to support this.
- Missions are grouped per contribution track such as localization, education, content
  creation and more.
- Promotions are only evaluated at the end of each season (every 3 months).
- Be aware that in case of Ambassadors breaking the Code of Conduct, or seem to be
  involved in disallowed activities, the core team reserves the right to suspend Ambassadors
  or downgrade their Rank accordingly.
- To support historical grpc queries, enable versiondb together with memiavl.
- Cronos is a leading blockchain ecosystem that has partnered with Crypto.com.
- Transaction fees are paid in Cronos ($CRO).
- Set to a slightly higher value, such as 20s to wait for a tx to be committed during
  / broadcast_tx_commit.
- Getting an Default API Key is required to access the APIs.
- Enable 'debug_trace' for your node on the Cronos chain by configuring correctly
  under app.toml.
- Configuration and data are stored in the folder located in the ~/.cronos directory
- Default configuration is stored in the ~/.cronos directory.
- Users can specify the cronosd config and data storage directory using the global
  flag --home <directory>.
- Ensure the mnemonic phrase is kept secure as it is the only way to recover the account.
- Currently, Cronos Play supports Unity, Unreal, and C++.
- Unreal Engine 4.27, 5.0, 5.1 or 5.2 are required.
- Ensure the connected app has appropriate permissions for OAuth2.
- Rate limiting may apply based on usage.
- Some API responses may have rate limits
- All Examples could be found here
- Cronos Play integration does not include any backend
- Cronos uses the Bech32 address format wherever users must handle binary data.
- The rate limit for Cronos Mainnet is 300 req/min/IP.
- The rate limit for Cronos Testnet is 500 req/min/IP.
- The staking module handles Proof-of-Stake related logics, which plays a very important
  part in the underlying consensus protocol.
- The bond_denom is 'basetcro'
- The unbonding_time is '1814400s'
- max_validators is 100
- max_entries is 7
- historical_entries is 100
- The module handles Proof-of-Stake related logics.
- Tracks account balances and total supply of tokens.
- Supports token transfer functionalities.
- Larger window for calculating the downtime requires higher availability.
- Longer jailing duration is needed for validators.
- Heavier penalty on byzantine faults for slashing.
- The base fee is adjusted at the end of each block based on the total gas used in
  the previous block.
- A structured, scalable initiative that shifts growth from centralized marketing
  to community-led activation.
- Rank reviews by the core team happen periodically and reflect your consistent contribution
  and impact.
- Promotions are evaluated at the end of each season (every 3 months)
- Seasonal points reset at the start of every new season
