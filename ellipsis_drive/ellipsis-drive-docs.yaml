notes:
- Requires a valid OAuth2 setup.
- API rate limits apply.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Processing time may take 3 to 10 minutes even for small files.
- Uploading and processing files runs in the background.
- Even when your files are small, it may still take 3 to 10 minutes for them to be
  processed into an active Layer.
- Uploading and processing files is a process that runs in the background.

- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Requires setup of OAuth2 with refresh tokens.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 credentials in Ellipsis Drive
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for access to API.
- API v3 documentation provides detailed endpoints for account, users, organization,
  and path.
- API supports raster data analysis.
- OAuth2 authentication is required for accessing the API endpoints.
- Setup requires adding the application in the Ellipsis Drive developer portal.
- By joining a layer or folder with a paywall, new users accept that Ellipsis Drive
  subtracts the fee from their account and transfers it to the account of the owner.
- Whenever a user lands on the url of the layer or folder in question or finds the
  layer or folder via the search they are requested to make the payment before accessing
  the data.
- The danger zone is called the DANGER ZONE because actions executed here are irreversible.
- API v3 is available for integration.
- Ensure proper authentication setup before accessing data.
- This API supports various operations related to accounts, users, and organizations.
- The number of Processing Units per user relates to how they are throttled in their
  intensity of use of the data you make available in your layers.
- Processing Units rack up when making requests to the API.
- PUs are being tracked because they create computing costs on the server side.
- You can check your TOTAL and CONSUMED PUs by visiting the dashboard here.
- Requires authentication via OAuth.
- Ensure proper permissions for file uploads.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for API access.
- Ellipsis Drive uses OAuth2 with refresh token.
- Make sure to check user permissions for accessing specific data.
- A user is authorized to download with access level View+ or higher.
- The generated link contains a token that authorises your audience to work with the
  spatial data.
- Ensure to generate an access token before making API calls.
- Rate limits apply on API usage.
- Requires OAuth2 for authentication.
- Ensure to register your application to get client credentials.
- Ensure to set up OAuth with the necessary scopes.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- OAuth flow is preferred for maintaining user login
- Requires OAuth2 authentication to access API.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication with refresh token.
- Ensure to set up the connected app for API access.
- OAuth2 authentication is required for accessing API endpoints.
- 'Delivery always consists of the following steps: Create a token, obtain the folder
  id, create a layer, create a timestamp, upload files, activate the timestamp.'
- API may have usage limits on certain endpoints
- Ensure OAuth setup is completed before accessing endpoints.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token.
- Supports OAuth2 authentication.
- Requires OAuth2 setup.
- API may have rate limits.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for all API calls.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication to access API endpoints
- In case your data does not behave well when zooming out it could be that you chose
  the wrong interpolation method while uploading.
- In case your data contains classes information you should always pick nearest neighbor
  interpolation to prevent certain classes form 'disappearing' on low zoom level.
- In case your data contains contains continuous measurements or optical data you
  can best choose linear interpolation to prevent your map from looking pixelated
  on low zoomlevel.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Ellipsis Drive.
- In 2D mode we keep scraping a random selection of features until reaching your browser’s
  memory limit when using Leaflet.
- If your data set includes under 8.000 geometries, we retrieve and display all of
  them right away.
- If your data set includes over 8.000 geometries we retrieve 4.000 and keep doing
  so as you navigate across the map.
- In 3D mode, that uses three.js instead of Leaflet, this limit is much, much higher.
- This API call has been replaced. See the new documentation.
- Ensure OAuth setup is complete before making API calls.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token for authentication.
- Ensure the proper scopes are set for the application.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 and connected app in Ellipsis Drive
- In case your data contains continuous measurements or optical data you can best
  choose linear interpolation to prevent your map from looking pixelated on low zoomlevel.
- You can set the interpolation method in the UI while uploading your files.
- MIND THAT HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS ARE ONLY RELEVANT WHEN YOU ARE HOSTING YOUR OWN
  INSTANCE. If you have Ellipsis Drive hosting your private instance for you as a
  service you will not need to concern yourself with any hardware requirements or
  scaling.
- API v3 is used for integration with Ellipsis Drive services.
- With the admin account you are able to access any piece of content you have in the
  system, regardless of the permission settings that the creator of the piece of content
  has set on it.
- With the back office account you are only able to see system metadata and manage
  users, but not able to actually access user content itself.
- A password and username may be required to connect your software to the webservice.
- ESRI software swaps X and Y coordinates in OGC protocols.
- Some versions of ESRI software require you to add '?request=getCapabilities&service=WFS'
  to the OGC link.
- API rate limits apply
- We recommend to use the principle of Least Privilege.
- Users should update their password regularly.
- Ellipsis drive never exposes a user email to another user, only the username.
- Integration requires API keys and setup.
- API usage may have rate limits.
- A private instance of Ellipsis Drive (ED) can in principle be hosted in any environment
  supporting docker.
- If you expect black pixels to be transparent, specify 0.
- If you expect white pixels to be transparent, specify 255.
- Requires connected app setup for OAuth2
- API calls may be rate-limited depending on the user's plan
- Data always needs to be read and written using the ellipsis Python package to make
  use of server side reading optimization.
- Your script can take free parameters that can be provided whenever the process is
  ran.
- Make sure your process works well under the given example parameters.
- 2 factor authentication may be required
- API v3 is the latest version for integration.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires connected app setup.
- Synced folders are read only from Ellipsis Drive.
- Requires setup of OAuth 2.0 credentials for access
- MIND THAT HARDWARE REQUIREMETNS ARE ONLY RELEVANT WHEN YOU ARE HOSTING YOUR OWN
  INSTANCE. If you have Ellipsis Drive hosting your private instance for you as a
  service you will not need to concern yourself with any hardware requirements or
  scaling.
- Ensure OAuth2 credentials are correctly set up in the API.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- No root access is needed to the host of the docker containers.
- It is highly recommended to deploy them in an Amazon VPC or a similar service.
- Users of the system can access the docker containers through the host.
- We recommend to use a managed service to store and rotate secrets for your application,
  such as AWS Secrets Manager.
- Backups of the data is not managed by the Ellipsis Drive application itself.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup
- Requires OAuth2 for authentication
- Ensure proper permissions are set for API access
