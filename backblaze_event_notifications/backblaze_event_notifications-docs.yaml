  - Webhook requests include HMAC SHA-256 signature verification. You must provide
    an `hmacSha256SigningSecret` when creating an Event Notification rule. The webhook
    request will include an `X-Bz-Event-Notification-Signature` HTTP header with format
    `v1=<64-character lowercase hex signature>`. To verify, compute HMAC-SHA256 of
    the request payload using `hmacSha256SigningSecret` as the key, then compare the
    resulting hex-encoded digest to the signature value in the header. Respond with
    200 OK if signatures match, or 401 Unauthorized if they do not.
