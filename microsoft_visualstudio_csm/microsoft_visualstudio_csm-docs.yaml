    JSON appears to be truncated at the end. However, I can see this is a Swagger
    2.0 definition for Azure''s Visual Studio Resource Provider.


    To properly extract endpoints, I would need to see the `paths` section of this
    Swagger document, which should contain the endpoint definitions.


    Based on what''s visible so far:'
