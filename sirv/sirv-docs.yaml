pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.sirv.com:
  - Pagination uses "from" and "size" parameters in the request body. "from" specifies
    the starting position (default 0) and "size" specifies the number of results per
    page (default 5). Increment "from" by the "size" value to retrieve subsequent
    pages.
  - Pagination uses from and size parameters in the request body. from specifies the
    offset (starting position, default 0) and size specifies the number of results
    per page (default 5). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing from by the
    size value to retrieve the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses from and size parameters in the request body. from specifies the
    starting position (default 0) and size specifies the number of results per page.
    Increment from by the size value to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Search results use scroll-based pagination with a scrollId. After an initial search
    request returns results with a scrollId field, use the POST /v2/files/search/scroll
    endpoint with the scrollId in the request body to retrieve the next batch of results.
  - The API uses a query parameter named `continuation` (string type) to paginate
    through results. Send the `continuation` value from the previous response as a
    query parameter in the next request to retrieve the next page of results.
