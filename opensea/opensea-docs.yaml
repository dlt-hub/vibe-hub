notes:
- It’s a read-only API—no minting.
- Rate limits are real. If you’re building something at scale or with dynamic content,
  make sure to cache aggressively and plan for graceful degradation in case the API
  gets throttled.
- WebSockets can be faster for real-time use cases because they avoid repeated HTTP
  handshakes.
- For sparse, cacheable interactions, HTTP (with caching and HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 optimizations)
  may be more efficient.
- Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) over TLS/SSL for encrypted connections, implement proper
  authentication and authorization.
- Courses require prior coding experience
- Programs include mentorship and coaching services
errors:
- 'Rate limit exceeded: Too many requests in a given amount of time.'
