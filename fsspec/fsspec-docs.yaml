notes:
- 'Pass-through cache: doesn''t keep anything, calls every time'
- File-like object to be used in a context
- Can layer (buffered) text-mode and compression over any file-system, which are typically
  binary-only
- These instances are safe to serialize, as the low-level file object is not created
  until invoked using with
- fsspec supports asynchronous operations on certain implementations
- Allows for concurrent calls within bulk operations such as cat
- AsyncFileSystem contains async def coroutine versions of the methods of AbstractFileSystem
- Methods are prefixed with underscore to indicate they are not to called directly
  in normal code
- The only async implementation built into fsspec is HTTPFileSystem
- File system instances can be created with asynchronous=True
- AsyncFileSystemWrapper is an experimental feature that allows you to convert a synchronous
  filesystem into an asynchronous one
- Users should not expect this wrapper to magically make things faster
- Uses POSIX command line cp behavior with extra functionality
- Supports multiple targets whereas command line cp is restricted to one
- Can create new directories automatically or via auto_mkdir=True keyword argument
- Depth of recursion can be controlled using maxdepth keyword argument
- Trailing slash on target is optional but recommended to explicitly indicate directory
- Instances are serializable for use across processes and machines
- Supports transparent compression and text-mode operations
- Provides buffering for both read and write operations
- Instance caching enabled by default for cachable implementations
- Listings caching available with time-based or LRU expiry
- URL chaining supported with '::' separator
- Local file caching available through filecache and blockcache
- Transaction support for atomic write operations
- PyArrow integration available for compatible filesystems
- FUSE mounting experimental but available
- Configuration via files, environment variables, or runtime dict
- Async operations supported on AsyncFileSystem implementations
- Callback support for progress tracking and logging
- Exclusive write feature is currently included on a trial basis and may change in
  the future
- Timing of existence check is not defined - may be at start or completion of operation
  depending on backend
- fsspec provides a unified pythonic interface to local, remote and embedded file
  systems and bytes storage.
- Uses various classes and functions to handle file operations.
- 'Four auth mechanisms are supported: insecure, spnego, token, basic-auth.'
errors:
- 'FileExistsError: Raised when using exclusive mode on a file that already exists'
