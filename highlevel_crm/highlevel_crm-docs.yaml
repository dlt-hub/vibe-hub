auth_info:
- information_source; https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/:
  - 'The API uses OAuth 2.0 or Private Integration Token authentication. Credentials
    are sent via the Authorization header as a Bearer token in the format "Authorization:
    Bearer YOUR_TOKEN".'
- information_source; https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/Scopes/index.html:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required to access the API. The API uses scopes to
    control access to specific endpoints and webhook events. Scopes include businesses.readonly,
    businesses.write, calendars.write, and others, with access types designated as
    Sub-Account. Specific scope requirements are mapped to individual API endpoints
    and webhook events as listed in the scope table.
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication. Access tokens are required to authenticate
    API requests, with token scope determining permissions for specific resources
    and operations. Tokens are obtained through OAuth 2.0 flows and must be included
    in requests to authorize access at the Sub-Account level.
- information_source; https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/contacts/get-contacts/index.html:
  - OAuth Access Token or Private Integration Token authentication is required, sent
    as a bearer token in the Authorization header. The scope contacts.readonly must
    be granted. Sub-Account Token type is used. API version 2021-07-28 must be specified
    in the Version header.
- information_source; https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/oauth/ExternalAuthentication/index.html:
  - You may pass user-entered authentication values such as API keys, usernames, or
    passwords accessed via the userData object with the syntax {{userData.key}}. The
    authentication URL must return HTTP status codes 200, 201, 202, or 204 to complete
    verification. External auth request parameters include companyId (string), field
    keys for user-entered credentials (string), approveAllLocations (boolean), and
    locationId, which are sent to validate the authentication flow.
