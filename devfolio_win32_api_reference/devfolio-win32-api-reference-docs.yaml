notes:
- This API is best for desktop apps that require direct access to system features
  and hardware.
- Must submit one project per team
- Must include a functioning onchain app at a publicly accessible URL
- Must include an open-source GitHub repository for source code built during the buildathon
- Must include a video, with a minimum length of 1 minute (Intro, Demo, Problem Statement,
  Solution, Architecture Overview)
- Integrating Basenames and Base Account is strongly recommended; they make it easy
  for anyone to get onchain.
- Must submit proof of deployment and 1+ transactions on Base testnet
- Runs from Oct 31 - Nov 1, 2025
- Happening in Rajpur Sonarpur, India
- Happening in Kukas, India
- Registration Closes 25th October 2025
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Darth VDR allows computations on private data through proprietary algorithms in
  isolated virtual data rooms.
- Proprietary algorithms can only fetch data from an allowed list of providers.
- Resolver contract on top of MakerDAO CDP protocol which issues the DAI Loan, Trade
  / Swap ERC20 tokens against margin or collateral of ETH and repayment of the Loan
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Devfolio
- Some data may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Hackathons hosted on Devfolio are dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable
  environment and harassment-free experience for everyone.
- Must include a video, with a minimum length of 1 minute
- Applications close on October 24, 2025.
- Must submit one project per team.
- Must include a functioning onchain app at a publicly accessible URL.
- Must include an open-source GitHub repository for source code built during the buildathon.
- If you are unable to troubleshoot the issue yourself, you can reach out to us at
  hello@devfolio.co.
- Our usual response times over email range from 12-24 hours.
- Currently, DeFi protocols must maintain a liquidity layer, and to sustain this liquidity,
  they rely heavily on regular reward emissions to incentivize users.
- LAP ensures funds are transferred back to users which may or may not be on different
  chain.
- Requires setup of connected app in Devfolio
- Some responses may contain null values in certain fields
- Online Auction System was implemented using Matic Blockchain
- Immutability of each bid was being registered
- Tracking and verification of bidding history was easier
- No bid cancellation’ feature was enabled to ensure fraud-free Auction
- Smart contracts (decentralized applications) written in Solidity
- Secured & transparent ledger system to encompass all bidding transactions
- Project directly addresses user experience and consumer satisfaction by giving them
  an opportunity to correct their transactions.
