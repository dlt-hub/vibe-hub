notes:
- Access Keys serve as a secure method to authenticate and interact with the flexiManage
  API.
- flexiWAN is built for and with SD-WAN in mind as a modern networking technology
- flexiWAN can be deployed on bare metal, VM or on supported cloud platforms
- flexiManage provides management and configuration of flexiEdge devices and statistics
  collection.
- flexiManage allows for hierarchy between organizations in the account.
- The device must be explicitly approved on flexiManage after registration.
- Enjoy the transparency, flexibility, and community support of open-source software.
- flexiWAN can be installed on various hardware types including bare-metal and virtualization
  platforms.
- flexiManage is a multi-tenant, multi-user, and multi-organization system.
- Like any other AI LLM Agent, some of the answers may be wrongly generated so make
  sure to check also the documentation and support resources.
- flexiManage is the single source of truth, any user or REST configuration is executed
  with no blocking.
- flexiWAN offers a powerful, open-source solution for your SD-WAN needs.
- For more in-depth information, you can always refer to the full documentation linked
  in each section.
- The email used in account creation and login is case sensitive
- During heavy traffic load, device connection to flexiManage may be impacted, prioritize
  with QoS will avoid it
- During heavy traffic load, loss and RTT calculation might represent biased values,
  prioritize with QoS will avoid it
- In most of the cases, the jobs have succeeded and the system recovers itself by
  re-syncing the configuration
- To restart the DHCP server for the WiFi interface, stop and start the flexiEdge
  router
- Inbound WAN ICMP with Identifier smaller or equal to 1024 may be dropped
- When VRRP enabled, ping from client to an IP address assigned to devices interfaces
  doesn’t work
- To resolve the issue reinstall QoS after the metric modification
- When modifying interface from flexiEdge web UI while on recovery mode, a backup
  for the recovery netplan files may be created flexiwan.recovery.baseline.yaml/fworig,
  these files are invalid and should be deleted
- One of the major flexiWAN strengths as an open source project is transparency.
- Please note that we don’t have a bounty program.
- Before deploying flexiWAN, ensure compatibility with your network cards.
- Most WiFi cards can work if the correct drivers are installed.
- 'Default username and password are: admin / flexiwan'
- Version 6.4.1 was released on Sep, 2024
- Installer image supports serial and monitor output. UEFI is required. Default baud
  rate is 115200.
- We strongly encourage and support responsible disclosure, if you have a security
  concern or have discovered a vulnerability in flexiWAN you would like to report,
  please contact us at security@flexiwan.com
- flexiManage is a multi-tenant management system that allows you to manage multiple
  independent and isolated networks within a single account.
- Before deploying flexiWAN, it’s crucial to ensure compatibility with your network
  cards.
- flexiWAN utilizes netplan for configuring network interfaces.
- Make sure to click Update Interfaces after making each interface change or configuration.

  or via SSH or using direct console.'
- Installer image supports serial and monitor output.
- UEFI is required. Default baud rate is 115200.
- flexiWAN requires at least one WAN and LAN for operation.
- Multiple WAN and LAN interfaces are supported.

- flexiWAN enables NAT Traversal by default, allowing devices to establish tunnels
  behind NAT, when there is a private IP on flexiEdge WAN.
- OSPF is enabled by default on the LAN across all flexiEdge devices
- flexiWAN uses encrypted IPSec over VxLAN tunnels between sites.
- Link Monitors functionality is designed to monitor network connections and ensure
  continuous reliability.
- The Edge Loopback feature allows for defining a local IP address for the flexiEdge.
- flexiWAN includes support for OSPF, enabled by default on the LAN.
- BGP is disabled by default and must be enabled for configuration.
- The default tunnel MTU is 1500 bytes, can be customized from the advanced options.
- Path Selection enables application based routing.
- Policies can be defined and different devices can have their own separate policies.
- LAN NAT translates the LAN addresses to a unique set of addresses while traversing
  the network.
- LAN NAPT allows an entire LAN subnet to be NAT-ed to one or more configured NAT
  IP addresses.
- Traffic back from the peer to flexiEdge does not benefit from the SD-WAN advantages
  available on flexiEdge as the remote peer sending the traffic is not a flexiEdge
  instance but rather an IPsec peer.
- In addition to high availability with VRRP, flexiWAN also includes and have out-of-the-box
  working WAN and tunnel redundancy for each of the devices.
- Notification settings can be changed on account, group and organization levels.
- Users can resolve a notification manually if it's no longer active or should they
  think it's not relevant.
- Path Selection enables application based routing with flexiWAN.
- Quality Based Routing (QBR) can be used with tunnel or DIA (internet breakout) Path
  Labels.
- flexiManage does not store credit card information, all billing transactions and
  management of credit cards information is handled by a secure 3rd party billing
  system.
- flexiWAN relies on Linux for underlying host OS.
- In order for QoS policy to work, link bandwidth must be set on device interfaces
  page.
- Private Google Mail accounts cannot be used with the Remote Worker VPN, only Google
  Workspace accounts are able to authenticate.
- IPsec Peering allows connecting pure IPSec tunnels between flexiEdge devices to
  other peers.
- The AI Network Healing feature will log events on the Notifications page.
- Tunnels may show in Not Connected state after initiating manual sync temporarily.
- flexiEdge UI is enabled by default on all interfaces and it can be accessed using
  device IP and port 8080
- PPPoE can only be provisioned from flexiEdgeUI and its parameters cannot be modified
  from flexiManage
- The account is charged once a month based on the maximum concurrent devices registered.
- flexiManage does not store credit card information, all billing transactions are
  handled by a secure third-party billing system.
- The invoice is generated at 00:00 UTC at the end of each billing period month.
- Connection Recovery is enabled by default to ensure automatic restoration of connectivity
  during outages or misconfigurations.
- 'Connection Recovery does not work in case of: Connection over VLAN, Connection
  over Wireless (LTE/5G/WiFi), Connection over PPPoE.'
- Devices must have identical number of interfaces.
- Device Replacement requires a new device in order to restore existing configuration
  to it.
- Device Recovery intended to restore flexiWAN configuration to an existing device.
- It is crucial to emphasize that if the device undergoes a complete hardware replacement,
  an entirely new set of hardware components, including the motherboard, is introduced.
- FlexiWAN supports Google Workspace and Azure AD for authentication.
- flexiManage accounts can be used for testing authentication.
- flexiEdge UI is enabled by default on all interfaces
- flexiWAN relies on netplan for interfaces configuration
- fwdump feature to gather all logs from a device
- Run fwsystem_checker to ensure hardware and software configurations are correct
- The script will create a new flexiWAN instance on your AWS account.
- Make sure to export your AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY before running
  the script.
- There is a known issue when modifying Configuration tab settings. Please make sure
  to stop vRouter before editing hardware configuration setting such as low power
  mode.
- flexiWAN relies on netplan for network management
- Hetzner VPS deployment delivers Ubuntu without netplan installed.
- Make sure to use Intel instead of AMD type. Using AMD will not work with flexiWAN
  due limitation on OCI.
- Connection Recovery does not work in case of Connection over VLAN, Connection over
  Wireless (LTE/5G/WiFi), Connection over PPPoE.
- Choose password authentication or SSH keys for Droplet creation
