notes:
- Flask-RestPlus specific parser for image uploading
- Return 3 most probable digits with their probabilities
- Exposes the API documentation using Swagger
- Prediction resource expects an image as input
- Docker is available for Linux, Mac Os and Windows (as well as cloud versions for
  AWS, Azure and IBM Cloud)
- Uses Flask within Firebase Cloud Functions
- 1 Cloud Function can wrap multiple Flask API Endpoints
- The online demo is limited to detect up to 50 faces per image, but using API you
  can limit the maximum number of detections by yourself.
- There is a hard limit for 10 results in some examples.
- Uses Infura as a provider for Ethereum network access.
- No authentication required for accessing data from this source.
