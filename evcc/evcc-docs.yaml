auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/devices/chargers:
  - The Volttime charger integration requires a personal access token for authentication.
    Provide the token value in the token field of the configuration; obtain it from
    https://developer.volttime.com/api-reference/authentication#personal-access-tokens.
    Additionally, a sponsor token is required for this integration.
  - The provided text contains OAuth2 authentication information for the Viessmann
    API. To obtain an access token, perform a POST request to https://iam.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/idp/v3/token
    with parameters redirect_uri, code_verifier, and code. Use the returned access_token
    value in the Authorization header as "Bearer $VIESSMANN_TOKEN" when making API
    requests to https://api.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/iot/v1/equipment/installations.
    The installation ID is then extracted from the JSON response.
  - Volt Time One requires an API token for authentication. The token is a personal
    access token obtained from https://developer.volttime.com/api-reference/authentication#personal-access-tokens
    and must be provided in the token configuration parameter. Additionally, the serial_number
    parameter is required to identify the specific charger device.
- information_source; https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/devices/heating:
  - The Viessmann API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow with PKCE. Obtain an access
    token by POST to https://iam.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/idp/v3/token with
    grant_type=authorization_code, client_id, redirect_uri, code_verifier, and code
    parameters. Then include the access token in the Authorization header as Bearer
    token when calling API endpoints like https://api.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/iot/v1/equipment/installations.
  - Uses OAuth2 with PKCE flow. Credentials are provided via environment variables
    VIESSMANN_USER, VIESSMANN_PASS, and VIESSMANN_CLIENT_ID. Basic auth (user:pass)
    is sent to the authorization endpoint at iam.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/idp/v3/authorize
    with parameters client_id, redirect_uri, scope (IoT User offline_access), response_type=code,
    code_challenge, and code_challenge_method=S256. The authorization code is extracted
    and then exchanged for a token via POST request with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
