- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/dev/rest.html:
  - API Key authentication is required. Include the API key in the X-API-Key header
    with each request to the REST API endpoints.
  - 'The REST API requires an API key for authentication. Set the request header `X-API-Key`
    to the API key value, which can be generated in the GUI or configured in the `configuration/gui/apikey`
    element in the configuration file. Example: `curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: abc123"
    http://localhost:8384/rest/...`'
- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/rest/system-browse-get.html:
  - API Key authentication is required. Include the API key in the X-API-Key header
    for all REST API requests.
- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/rest/system-config-get.html:
  - API Key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `X-API-Key` header
    with each request to the REST API endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/rest/system-config-post.html:
  - 'Syncthing REST API uses API key authentication. The API key must be provided
    in the X-API-Key header for all requests. Obtain the API key from the Syncthing
    web UI or configuration file, then include it as X-API-Key: your-api-key in request
    headers.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/rest/db-need-get.html:
  - Pagination uses optional `page` and `perpage` query parameters. Results are returned
    across a union of multiple sections (progress, queued, rest), with pagination
    applied across all sections combined. The response includes a `total` field indicating
    the total number of available items across all sections.
- information_source; https://docs.syncthing.net/v1.0.0/rest/events-get.html:
  - The `/rest/events` endpoint uses the `since` query parameter for pagination, which
    accepts the ID of the last seen event and defaults to 0. The response is a JSON
    array of event objects starting after the specified event ID. Events have IDs
    that should be continuous; discontinuities indicate missed events due to server-side
    buffering limits.
