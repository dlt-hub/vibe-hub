auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.qencode.com/api-reference/transcoding/:
  - Authentication uses a token-based approach. First, obtain a token via an initial
    API call, then pass that token as the "token" parameter to subsequent API methods
    like /v1/create_task. The token has an expiration time and is required to initialize
    transcoding jobs and receive a task_token for further operations.
  - Qencode uses an API key-based authentication flow. First, obtain a session-based
    access token by calling POST /v1/access_token with your api_key parameter, then
    use that token to authenticate subsequent API requests. The api_key should be
    managed server-side and never exposed in client applications.
- information_source; https://docs.qencode.com/tutorials/transcoding/getting-started/:
  - Qencode API uses API key authentication to obtain an access token. Submit your
    api_key parameter to the POST endpoint https://api.qencode.com/v1/access_token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, receive a token in the JSON
    response, and include that token in subsequent API calls until expiration.
