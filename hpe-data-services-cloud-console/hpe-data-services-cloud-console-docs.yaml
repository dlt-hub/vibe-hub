notes:
- The access token has a limited lifetime (about 7200 seconds or 2 hours).
- If the client application generates a new access token before the current one has
  expired, then the current access token will be invalidated.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Access token will expire after 2 hours past from the time of creation.
- Asynchronous execution means that execution of the API will complete and return
  with response status= 0x202.
- The major version number will be provided in the resource path as 'v1'.
- All REST API operations are stateless.
- Carbon footprint information is only available after running a report from the HPE
  GreenLake Cloud Platform GUI.
- 'Data source: Infinity-COM'
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Access token expires after 120 minutes and needs to be regenerated.
- Session location token will remain valid for 1440 minutes (or 24 hours)
- Admin role is required to access API.
- Client Key and Client Secret pair are required for making Wellness API calls.
- HPE GreenLake webhooks require webhook secret management and HMAC SHA-256 signature
  verification.
- Access bearer token expires after 120 minutes.
- Uses Kubernetes services to expose applications via HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise
  Gateway.
- The access token is designed to enable secure transmission between the client application
  and the REST API server with a limited lifetime (2 hours).
- The subscription key must be passed in the request header for all API calls.
- Users log in to the face detection application running on the EL300 Kubernetes cluster.
- The application fetches the current image from the network camera.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Token expiration or invalid token.'

- '422: Missing required field(s) - lastOccurredAt, customerId, createdAt, id, resourceUri,
  generation, type'
- '0x202: Accepted, operation is running in the background.'
