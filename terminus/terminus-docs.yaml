auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.terminusapp.com/apidocs/:
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key using HTTP Basic Auth with
    the format `YOUR_API_KEY:` (colon-separated, where the password is empty) in the
    `-u` parameter or Authorization header.

    basic auth (format: `YOUR_API_KEY:` with a colon and empty password) using the
    `-u` flag in requests to the API endpoint.'
  - API key authentication is required. Send your API key in the Authorization header
    using basic auth format with the API key as the username and an empty password
    (YOUR_API_KEY:), or pass it via the -u flag in curl requests.
  - API requests require authentication using an API key from your Terminus account.
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key and pass it via HTTP Basic Authentication
    (the `-u` flag in curl, or username field with the API key followed by a colon
    and empty password). The API key is sent as the username component in the Authorization
    header using Basic Auth scheme.
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with an API key. Send the API key as the username
    in the Authorization header using the format `-u YOUR_API_KEY:` (with a colon
    and empty password), or equivalently set the Authorization header to `Basic base64(YOUR_API_KEY:)`.
