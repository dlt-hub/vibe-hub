  auth: Currently, all API v3 endpoints that require authentication must use account
    API tokens, while the API v2 endpoints require either account or project API tokens.
  most_recurring_base_url: https://bitbucket.org
  paginator: Pagination is required for endpoints that return large lists, supporting
    cursor-based pagination; a cursor is included in the `pagination` object to obtain
    the next page of results by calling the endpoint again with the cursor. A page
    size is specified using the `limit` parameter, with a default page size of 100.
