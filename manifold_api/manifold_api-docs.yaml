auth_info:
- information_source; https://wiki.manifold.autos/docs/authentication:
  - Manifold uses API key-based authentication. Include your API token in the x-api-key
    header for all HTTP requests. API keys are generated through the Manifold portal,
    have full account access, cannot be refreshed (generate new ones when expired),
    and must be kept private. A Connection-Id is also required for most endpoints
    to specify the data source.
  - The Manifold API uses API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. Include
    your valid API key in the `x-api-key` header for each request; invalid or expired
    keys will return a 401 Unauthorized error. Generate new keys through the Manifold
    portal when needed.
  - To access the Manifold API, you authenticate using an API token generated from
    the Manifold portal Settings. The token identifies your account and grants access
    to vehicle data, driver information, and other endpoints. However, the specific
    header name, parameter name, or method for sending the token in requests is not
    described in this excerpt.

  - Manifold uses API key-based authentication. Include your API token in the `x-api-key`
    header of each HTTP request. Additionally, include a `Connection-Id` header to
    specify the data source. API tokens are generated from the Manifold portal Settings
    > API Tokens section and have full account access, so they must be kept secure
    and never shared publicly.
