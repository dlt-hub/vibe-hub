auth_info:
- information_source; https://helpmailup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/mailupapi/pages/36341777/Authenticating+with+OAuth+v2:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Bearer MYACCESSTOKEN" when making requests
    to the API endpoints.'
  - MailUp API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization and authentication. Applications are
    authorized using a pair of access keys consisting of a Client ID and Client Secret.
    Users are authenticated using their MailUp account credentials (username and password).
    The Client ID and Client Secret function as the oauth2 client_id and client_secret
    parameters in the OAuth 2.0 specification.
  - MailUp uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Access tokens are obtained by
    POST to https://services.mailup.com/Authorization/OAuth/Token with grant_type=authorization_code
    (or grant_type=refresh_token to refresh). Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer MYNEWACCESSTOKEN" for all resource requests. Tokens expire after
    3600 seconds and can be refreshed using the refresh_token returned in the token
    response.
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer MYACCESSTOKEN". When the access token expires
    (HTTP 401), refresh it by POST to https://services.mailup.com/Authorization/OAuth/Token
    with form parameters client_id, client_secret, refresh_token, and grant_type set
    to "refresh_token". Both the access token and refresh token are renewed in the
    response and must be updated for subsequent requests.
  - OAuth 2.0 is required for MailUp REST API (except Transactional APIs). Applications
    must register to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret pair, which are used as
    access keys in the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. These credentials identify the
    application and are used according to OAuth 2.0 specifications to authorize requests.
