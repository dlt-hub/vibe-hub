notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Utilize an API Gateway to facilitate routing and CORS enablement across different
  services.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Broadleaf
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Broadleaf provides an AuthorizationService which can be used by customers and admins
  to generate secure oAuth tokens (JWT) for making service API calls.
- Broadleaf uses a Policy annotation to protect endpoints and data with the ability
  to have role based access for read and write operations.
- FlexPackage approach requires additional configuration for data routing.
- 'Known limitation: Spring Data @Query annotation does not benefit from trackable
  narrowing.'
- Authorization for service calls is based on standards including OAuth although implementation
  details are flexible as they are based on Spring Security and configurable to work
  with a variety of security models.
- Broadleaf has developed a unique technology called Flex Package Composition that
  is targeted directly at advanced composable commerce.
- Each service can have its own database.
- Most companies will utilize one (or a few) cloud database with each service configured
  to a separate schema.
- Extensibility is as a first class concern with the Broadleaf framework.
- Broadleaf provides mechanisms to override, extend, and replace out of box components
  through configuration and custom code.
- The Broadleaf Unified Admin is also fully extensible and is covered more in the
  related documentation sections.
- This article focuses on programmatic domain extension.
- Many entities within Broadleaf can be extended by business users by using the 'custom
  field' functionality within the admin.
- The OAuth2 authorization server is responsible for issuing access tokens for accessing
  Broadleaf Services.
- Requires setup of connected app in Broadleaf Microservices
- The Admin Navigation Service does not have any configured Admin Metadata, and traditionally
  cannot be managed through the Admin portal itself.
- Menu Items are typically introduced and managed through the database, using SQL
  insert statements for initial configuration and Liquibase to perform adjustments
  and additions.
- These translations are for display on the commerce-facing app rather than for the
  admin user’s benefit.
- Static text is made translatable by defining a react-intl message descriptor.
- As of 1.8.3-GA we have introduced field-level user-access restriction.
- As of 1.8.3-GA, we have introduced Content Security Policy headers for the admin
  app.
- We’ve migrated from Create React App to Vite to speed up development time, reduce
  time to first paint, and cut down heavily on 3rd-party dependencies.
- To start up for local dev, use `yarn watch` instead of `yarn start`.
- To start up for production, use `yarn sample:start` after doing a `yarn build`.

- Now supports Node 18. Node 14 has reached end-of-life and we recommend upgrading
  to Node 18 as soon as possible since Node 16 reaches end of life in September 2023.
- Upgrading Node is not required to use this update.
- If building your own images of Admin Starter, it is required to add a new dependency
  to your project on luxon, which was introduced to address timezone issues in date-pickers.
- If building your own images of Admin Starter, it is required to add a new dependency
  to your project on `luxon`, which was introduced to address timezone issues in date-pickers.
- Requires setup of Broadleaf’s Container Registry and Nexus Repository.
- It is recommended that you generate a new set of security artifacts for every environment
  that Broadleaf is deployed to (e.g. Dev, QA, Production)
- While this is optional, it is highly recommended that you now store these generated
  artifacts in the security folder in a shared secure location (i.e. NOT in a source
  control system) preferably a secrets manager or vault.
- In local development environments only, IP whitelisting does not matter.
- If using a Broadleaf manifest-based project, this is typically already generated
  for you in `config/insecure/gateway-local.yml`.
- If using a Broadleaf manifest-based project, you can place this in `config/insecure/gateway-cloud.yml`.
- If you are using Ingress NGINX deployed as an ingress controller in your K8s cluster,
  the Broadleaf gateway will receive requests from the IP address of the Kubernetes
  pod the controller is deployed on.
- If you are using Google Cloud Application Load Balancer, Google provides documentation
  outlining the 'source IP address' that backend systems will see.
- If you are using Azure Application Gateway, the backend system will see the IP of
  the Azure Application Gateway.
- Requires authentication with Broadleaf's docker registry
- Base Helm Charts are only applicable to legacy `MicroservicesDemo`-based projects.
- Broadleaf supports OpenTelemetry for exporting application health, logging, and
  performance signals.
- In a pre-production or production environment, you will want to enable certain properties
  specific for these higher level environments and disable those that are meant purely
  for development.
- Imports often involve many records being placed into a sandbox. The process of establishing
  the initial sandbox state for these records, as well as subsequent promotion/deployment
  can be perceived as a performance bottleneck based on number of records.
- Since Release Train 1.8.3 - if utilizing an Initializr-based project, this property
  is set to false by default
- 'If you are using a MicroservicesDemo based project, see this KB Article for more
  details: https://helpdesk.broadleafcommerce.com/hc/en-us/articles/15010311974164-Demo-Data-Disabling-Demo-Data'
- 'See configuration of JWT Keys for more details: https://developer.broadleafcommerce.com/production/configuration/generating-private-public-key-jwt.
  See the configuration of the Auth Service for more details: https://developer.broadleafcommerce.com/services/authentication-services'
- The scalability white paper introduces a naming scheme that combines application
  and infrastructure sizing into a shortened name like BS3 or GL5 for easy reference.
- Much more detail around these recommendations can be found in the Scalability White
  Paper, particularly in Appendix F - Technical Recommendations.
- As of Broadleaf 1.5.x, we have deprecated the use of org.apache.camel.component.jgroups.cluster.JGroupsLockClusterService
  as the default.
- The manifest file can now be used to establish your desired cluster service implementation
  type, per environment if desired.
- Broadleaf makes use of private and public keys in services when signing and verifying
  the JWT tokens.
- In the lab, using a configuration similar to above, we saw a 50x - 60x boost in
  performance over the previous version codebase with default configuration.
- This FlexPackage is not intended for production usage.
- Shared libraries and functionality that is common to more than one service.
- The feature is disabled by default. Enable the @ConfigurationProperties annotated
  bean proxy behavior by setting the property com.broadleafcommerce.environment.property.discrimination.enabled
  to true.
- Discrimination requires the DiscriminatedPropertyContext be set.
- Requires setup of connected app in Broadleaf
- Some responses may contain nulls in nested fields
- The created date is set at the time of entity first creation, and in the case of
  Trackable entities with sandbox behavior, at the time of sandbox state creation.
- This feature is still in Beta. Functionality and documentation are subject to change.
- Broadleaf suggests using the ULID type for any primary key and context id values.
  This type has advantageous behavior across datacenters, as it avoids the likelihood
  of id collision. It is also lexicographically sortable, which makes it work well
  for database indexes.
- Imports and exports are independent of each other and have different architectures.
- There is no implied guarantee that exported files of any given data type match the
  schema expected for an import.
- Imports and exports are independent of each other and have different architectures.
  There is no implied guarantee that exported files of any given data type match the
  schema expected for an import.
- Export is not its own microservice; the Export functionality is added to existing
  microservices through the broadleaf-common-dataexport dependency.
- Export is not its own microservice. The Export functionality is added to existing
  microservices entirely through the broadleaf-common-dataexport dependency.
- Broadleaf provides generic libraries and facilities for managing translated data.
- To add a new Locale to the admin, use properties in the YAML configuration for Broadleaf
  1.8.1 and later.
- See Data Translations for more information on making an entity translatable.
- Broadleaf does not currently make use of Solr’s Currency functionality due to the
  fact that it requires a managed list of currencies and exchange rates.
- Native broker integrations may also provide more advanced features than what are
  supported by Spring Cloud Stream.
- Uses Spring Cloud Stream for messaging with durable send capabilities
- Broadleaf leverages Spring Cloud Stream for message handling.
- Idempotent consumption patterns must be implemented for message processing.
- Broadleaf channels are configured for groups by default to achieve consumption durability.
- The goal will generally be to receive one message instance per group and to do so
  in a durable fashion.
- Non-blocking retry favors not blocking processing of messages on the main consumption
  binding in order to handle retries.
- When the non-blocking retry feature is enabled, several components are automatically
  wired up for you.
- When combined with non-blocking retry, message lock takeover provides a high availability
  solution to message processing.
- The system should use non-blocking retry for Broadleaf consumer binding.
- The system should recover from catastrophic failure using message lock takeover.
- This service supports a layer of security for guest carts to help protect against
  attackers for guest customers.
- Whenever executing transactions against payments for an Order, a lock should always
  be obtained to ensure no other conflicting operations occur simultaneously.
- By default, Broadleaf only supports performing transactions that encompass one Order
  Fulfillment at once, not the whole Order.
- These configurations typically only affect the Granular Deployment model. For Min
  and Balanced deployements, these configurations are likely already added at the
  flexpackage-level configuration.
- The Cart domain also has a version field to ensure that stale cart states do not
  overwrite the latest one.
- It is crucial to understand that the list of payment gateways for each property
  is ordered. Payment gateway that is placed at the first of the list will be the
  highest priority.
- At the time of this writing, there’s no sandboxable entities in this service.
- This library has been deprecated in 1.8.2-GA in favor of FulfillmentCommon.
- The TaxCommon library is not a stand-alone Microservice.
- If intended to be used in production for calculating taxes, be aware that the implementor
  or user of this component is responsible for accurate configuration of SimpleTaxConfig
  and SimpleTaxRecord instances.
- Each TaxProvider instance must provide a different value returned from getProviderId()
  to avoid exceptions.
- Implementations must consider how to handle adjustTaxes and reverseTaxes after commitTaxes.
- This library is used by Cart Operations Services to determine fulfillment pricing
  for carts.
- The property broadleaf.orderoperation.ordergeneration.removeVatFromItemPrice controls
  if the item’s price on the Order should include the VAT.
- The SimpleTaxProvider is used for demo and default tax calculations if no other
  TaxProviders are introduced.
- Implementors or users of this component must maintain the tax configuration details
  and must ensure that taxes are paid according to what was collected and what is
  legally owed.
- Only the properties defined in your `EnvironmentPostProcessor` will be pulled out
  of this property file, all other properties will be ignored.
- The SimpleTaxProvider uses the result of DefaultDelegatingTaxService#isItemIncludesTaxes
  to decide if taxes should be calculated as included taxes.
- disables the exception handler completely when set to false (defaults to true)
- includes a GlobalError for stacktrace in the response with the full stack trace
- whether or not to include the exception class name in the response
- Fallback properties can be provided if the secure vault cannot connect.
- The RuleEvaluationService accepts ExpressionContext as an argument to each of its
  methods as a way to customize data or behavior for each specific invocation.
- A static instance StandardExpressionContext.EMPTY_EXPRESSION_CONTEXT is available
  for consumers that don’t have any special requirements.
- Broadleaf provides a handful of default variables for utility functions.
- Customize property accessors by introducing new implementations.
- includes a GlobalError for stacktrace in the response with the full stack trace.
- whether or not to include the exception class name in the response.

  methods.
- The default for XSS validation is true.
- Broadleaf provides utility functions through default variables in every EvaluationContext.
- The anonymization endpoints provided by Broadleaf can be called safely multiple
  times for the same customer id.
- Before anonymizing data, make sure to first consider the implications on your business’s
  ability to complete any processes that are not yet finalized.
- Encrypting data as it’s transported over the network (e.g. customer browser communication
  to the microservice) is important as well. All communications with Broadleaf services
  are setup by default to use https protocol leveraging TLS1.2.
- Broadleaf leverages Spring Security and Spring Security OAuth as the default vehicle
  for securing the microservice architecture.
- Each microservice leverages OAuth2 by default and requires a valid bearer token
  in the header for authorization.
- The default XSS validation is true.
- Encrypting data at rest is generally not achieved directly through the framework
  tooling, but instead through infrastructure facilities - specifically the cloud
  provider.
- Encrypting data as it’s transported over the network is important as well. All communications
  with Broadleaf services are setup by default to use https protocol leveraging TLS1.2.
- 'Sellers do not actually impersonate customers or guests when entering the storefront:
  They act as themselves to perform Seller-specific operations.'
- A parameter, impersonate_self=true, is used to indicate that the admin is 'impersonating'
  themselves.
- Data Feeds functionality is in a pre-release stage and not generally available.
- DataFeedServices will create a new IncrementalDataFeedEntityUpdateRecord upon receipt
  of an IncrementalDataFeedEntityUpdateEvent message.
- Test sources available from Broadleaf 1.7.2 onward
- The starting quantity is a required field when utilizing the flash sale pricing.
  In case the available quantity is left empty, its value would be matched to the
  starting quantity.
- The starting quantity and the available quantity fields of a PriceData can be defined
  only once i.e. at the time of creation. After its creation, these fields become
  read-only and strictly serve informational purpose.
- During high-traffic events like flash sale, a large number of users would be trying
  to buy multiple items with heavily discounted prices.
- Quote functionalities are enabled by default, but are controlled by a tenant/application
  discriminated property.
- Sellers do not actually impersonate customers or guests when entering the storefront.
- Admin enters an impersonation session but acts as themselves, not as a customer.
- Partial update processes are designed to keep feeds up-to-date in between the more
  comprehensive full process runs.
- The starting quantity is a required field when utilizing the flash sale pricing.
- The starting quantity and the available quantity fields of a PriceData can be defined
  only once i.e. at the time of creation.
- Users can also utilize the Import Price Data functionality of PriceData for bulk
  setup of flash sale pricing.
- Workflows will be more deeply leveraged in the framework in future releases.
- 'Broadleaf makes use of 6 collections (and 6 aliases), by default: 2 for Catalog
  data, 2 for Customer data, 2 for Order data.'
- Solr and ZooKeeper are unsecured by default.
- Security should be enabled for production environments.
- If you do not have an Enterprise License, you can request free limited term developer
  evaluation credentials here.
- Enable old liquibase compatibility behaviour with new Initializr
- the contents of the security directory should NOT be stored in source control, but
  instead should be uploaded and managed in a secure location such as an encrypted
  vault.
- The Broadleaf Manifest and Initializr are compatible with Broadleaf Release Train
  1.8.2 and above.
- If you're running on Windows, make sure to click `Modify Options` > and enable the
  `Shorten command line` option and choose `@argfile (Java 9+)`.
- For Java 17, make sure to add the required VM Options.
- The default password for the starter postgres instance is generated and can be found
  in the `security` module in your `credentials-report.env` file.
- Ensure that the existing values for these properties in the .env are replaced with
  the following or errors will occur on start up.
- If you add `@broadleaf/payment-react` you will **not** need to also add `@broadleaf/payment-js`.
- Broadleaf uses a collection for Catalog data.
- Broadleaf maintains 2 collections for catalog data.
- Broadleaf offers a default Solr and Zookeeper installation, complete with all configuration
  sets, as a docker container.
- This document covers release train 2.x.x, and beyond.
- For your project build, if using Alpine, it is advisable to use the platform directive
  as well
- The Broadleaf Manifest and Initializr is compatible with Broadleaf Release Train
  1.8.2 and above.
- The generated manifest project from the Initializr will also contain a HELP.md file
  that should be referenced when first generating your project.
- Broadleaf production-ready images for gateway and config are available in Alpine
  flavors.
- If performing a multiplatform build, the machine running the build process must
  have created a new builder instance.
- In some cases, the Dockerfile may expect yarn build (or similar) to have been run
  already. You can review each Dockerfile for more information.
- docker buildx bake was chosen for its maintainability advantages, as it allows complexities
  to be placed into the docker-bake.hcl file and simplifies the configuration of the
  Maven profile.
- Depending on your particular demo provision, you may not be able to access certain
  resources that are restricted to higher-level 'tenant' contexts.
- In most cases, your demo will be provisioned as an 'application-restricted' instance
  within the default 'tenant', and will have a more limited scope of available resources.
- Even in this case, most core functionality is still readily available!
- In almost all cases, you should use BroadleafOAuth2ClientCredentials to authenticate.
- Make sure to run ./mvnw docker-compose:down when done to free up resources
- The default password for the starter postgres instance is generated and can be found
  in the security module in your credentials-report.env file.
- Important to understand the potential vulnerability of opening up cross-origin requests
  in local environments.
- Required when using a Private Demo instance as the backend since it is enabled there.
- The manifest-based starter will default to generating Alpine Linux images for all
  Broadleaf components.
- The Ubuntu Linux image is available as multiplatform with both arm64 and amd64 support.
- Generally, developers do not build Docker images locally. Instead, they run the
  components directly from command line or IDE.
- For your project build, if using Alpine, it is advisable to use the platform directive.
- In some cases, the `Dockerfile` may expect `yarn build` (or similar) to have been
  run already. You can review each `Dockerfile` for more information.
- '`docker buildx bake` was chosen for its maintainability advantages, as it allows
  complexities to be placed into the `docker-bake.hcl` file and simplifies the configuration
  of the Maven profile.'
- Most core functionality is still readily available!
- For security, the token you obtain won’t last a very long time. After some time,
  you may find that the operation returns a `401` 'Unauthorized' error. To resolve
  this, you can simply repeat the authentication/authorization process.
- You will need to get an access token for any API requests for user-specific data
  such as the Customer DTO or pricing.
- Uses Cart SDK for operations against a cart
- Uses OAuth2 with authorization code grant flow.
- Silent Auth uses an iframe to handle token refresh.
- Assumes that TENANT_RESOLVER_APPLICATION_RESOLUTION=url for URL-Based Resolution
- Assumes that TENANT_RESOLVER_APPLICATION_RESOLUTION=token for Token-Based Resolution
- For guest users, item lists are stored in browser cache.
- Registered users have item lists persisted in the database when certain thresholds
  are met.
- A **ContentTargeter** allows different *ContentItems* to be served based on customizable
  rules.
- The actual digital asset for the banner is not returned from the Personalization
  Service but a content URL.
- To take advantage of the Extensibility Patterns outlined in the Microservices Concepts
  project, you will need to upgrade to the latest broadleaf common library dependencies.
- Cart SDK should be used for operations against a cart.
- Make sure that the @JpaEntityScan is referencing the correct package where your
  extensions exist (i.e. com.broadleafdemo.catalog.jpa.domain)
- If unfamiliar with the DataDrivenEnum concept, you can learn more by referencing
  Documentation on DataDrivenEnums and DataDrivenEnum’s Data Model
- Make sure that the custom metadata is defined in the MetadataServices (i.e. `MyProject/services/metadata`)
  and **not** CatalogServices
- If unfamiliar with search fields or indexing, you can learn more by referencing
  SearchServices Documentation
- For more details about `ProductDetails` and contributors, you can learn more by
  referencing [Facilitating Product Details Pages](/services/catalog-services/commerce/product-details)
- For the commerce app, the number of items that can be persisted into the database
  is determined by the .env file property NEXT_PUBLIC_RECENTLY_VIEWED_LIST_PERSIST_THRESHOLD.
- The base URL and URI paths for offers are configurable via the offer-defaults.yml
  file.
- Extensibility is a first class concern with the Broadleaf framework.
- You will need to upgrade to the latest broadleaf common library dependencies listed
  here which can be applied to any installation running Release Train 1.7.3 or above.
- You will want to construct the appropriate WebClient and request payload that is
  appropriate for calling your API
- Microservices Concepts project available for common extension use-cases
- OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Make sure to consider this bean’s order compared to the existing activities. In
  general, the ordering of your activities doesn’t matter too much for a successful
  execution, but it’s worth considering how the activity’s ordering may affect a rollback.
- 'Make sure to be mindful of the cart’s versioning when handling rollbacks. When
  the checkout fails, a version of the cart is returned from the API and can be acted
  against. Therefore, if you need update the cart as a part of the rollback, then
  you may have an out-of-date version, or the rollback may cause the API-returned
  version become out-of-date. There are two ways around this issue:  1. Store state
  changes else where so that the cart doesn’t have to be updated (this is done for
  inventory reservations). 2. Leverage a syncronous rollback so that all rollback
  activities are completed before the cart is returned via the API.'
- For input channels, it’s important to declare a consumer group (i.e. my-checkout-completion-group)
  to ensure that the message is not processed multiple times if there are multiple
  instances of the application.
- Throwing an exception while processing the message and allowing it to bubble up
  to the @StreamListener proxy will engage Spring Cloud Stream’s retry and dead letter
  queue mechanisms.
- As of Broadleaf 1.5, a new DataDrivenEnum concept was introduced to dynamically
  manage enums via the admin.
- Introduces a DataDrivenEnum concept for managing enums via the admin.
- Spring Cloud Stream uses this configuration behind the scenes to auto-generate Kafka
  queues/topics.
- By default, Broadleaf registers the out-of-box bindings in `*-defaults.yml` properties
  files.
- Defining required scopes and authorities is critically important for security.
- You may need to enable your auto-configuration class via spring.factories.
- Ensure the handler returns exactly 1 BatchCompletionRecord for every BatchRecord
  it receives.
- The service client to use when calling external offer services is 'offerclient'.
- A production implementation should instead leverage a query method that will actually
  stream records incrementally from the datastore.
- As of Export Common 2.0.1, the old exportManager.initiateExport() method that obtains
  the export filter string from the endpoint’s request parameter was deprecated.
- Custom fulfillment statuses include IN_TRANSIT and DELIVERED.
- Fulfillment statuses must be set in the OrderView.
- The following requires ENTERPRISE credentials and access to various Broadleaf resources
  outlined in this guide.
- If you need to 'regenerate' certs, the flex:generate process will NOT replace existing
  certs.
- If for some reason the contents of your security and config folders get out of sync,
  you can always delete them and run flex:generate again.
- By default, Broadleaf registers the out-of-box bindings in *-defaults.yml properties
  files.
- the installation process for this tutorial assumes that all resources will be installed
  to the default namespace.
- the default passwords for the initial admin master users are dynamically generated
  and can be found in your security folder in your credentials-report.env file.
- Defining required scopes and authorities is critically important for security as
  discussed in this documentation.
- If using the MicroservicesDemo Starter Project, the Granular pricing service is
  set up to listen on port 8448
- You may need to enable your auto-configuration class via `spring.factories` as discussed
  in this documentation.
- The minimum recommended node version is 18 because v14 reaches end-of-life (EOL)
  in April 2023 followed by v16 in September 2023.
- The minimum version of React has been upgraded to v17 which should not require any
  additional changes.
- Future versions will require v18 which will potentially include migration steps.
- Custom statuses include IN_TRANSIT and DELIVERED.
- Only fulfillments with DELIVERED status can be returned.
- Catalog Services offers a comprehensive implementation of bulk operations.

- This is a sparse release from `1.7.5-GA` with a couple of bug fixes
- Fixes an issue with Camel Cluster Service dependency versions that was causing stability
  issues with cluster services used in Broadleaf.
- Fixes an issue with caching where incorrect results could be returned from a cache.
- The JSON config file may still be used, but will only be consulted if no YAML configuration
  is provided.
- JSON also only supports global configuration not application or tenant discrimination.
- JDK 11 is now required for Broadleaf release trains 1.7.0-GA, and beyond.
- The saved request (BLSR), saved authorized client (BL-ACS-*), and saved authorization
  request (BLSAR) cookies now default to SameSite=Lax in their attributes.
- The deprecated Cart cookie (BLCART) now defaults to SameSite=Lax in its attributes.
- This follows the same Spring Boot conventions for projects that don’t inherit a
  Parent POM.
- The version of the flex-parent pom will contain a reference to the appropriate Release
  Train version.
- You should rarely modify the versions of dependencies directly in `package.json`
  and never modify `yarn.lock` directly.
- Broadleaf evaluates CVEs for false positives regarding Broadleaf framework usage,
  which may preclude or delay individual third-party library update considerations.
- While uncommon, if you are able to include a system property with your maven build
  command, then you can override the base dependencies version without extending the
  release train.
- The end result of steps 1 & 2 should be a migrate.sql file that represents the delta
  between the baseline and the target version.
- Indexes are specifically NOT applied during a liquibase upgrade, unless the target
  table is empty.
- This SQL will then be useful to apply manually against a development environment
  for confirmation of functionality with the upgraded codebase.
- The end result be a migrate.sql file that represents the delta between the reference
  and the target version.
- Moreover, it should only contain the relevant index creation statements.
- You must register to access certain areas of the Site.
- Request a Demo Instance of Broadleaf Microservices
