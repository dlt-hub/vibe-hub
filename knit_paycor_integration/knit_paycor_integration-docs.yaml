    pagination. The response is paginated, though specific response fields indicating
    pagination state (such as next page indicators or total count) are not detailed
    in the provided documentation.
- information_source; https://developers.getknit.dev/docs/paycor-usecases:
  - 'For the "Get Tenant Work Locations by TenantID" endpoint: continuationToken is
    an optional query parameter used to fetch the next set of work locations. The
    response includes a boolean indicating if more results are available, a continuation
    token for fetching additional records, and a URL for additional results. Use the
    returned continuation token in the next request to paginate through work location
    records.'
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter continuationToken to fetch additional
    records. Use the continuationToken value from the response to request the next
    set of results.
  - The API supports pagination through an optional query parameter 'continuationToken'
    used to fetch additional records. The response indicates whether more results
    are available and includes a continuation token for fetching the next set of data.
  - The Get Persons By TenantID API uses continuationToken as an optional query parameter
    for pagination. The response includes a continuation token and URL indicating
    whether more results are available, and you use the returned continuation token
    in the next request to fetch additional results. The Get Punch Error Logs by Legal
