auth_info:
- information_source; https://stitch-docs.netlify.app/docs/integrations/import-api:
  - 'Authentication with the Import API requires an API access token placed in the
    Authorization header as a bearer token, and your client ID used in the request
    body. Generate the API access token by logging into your Stitch account, adding
    an Import API integration, and clicking Save and Generate Token. The Authorization
    header format is "Authorization: Bearer [access_token]". Keep the token secret
    as it has write access to your Stitch account; revoke and regenerate if compromised.'
  - Authorization uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The access_token
    is obtained through a two-step authentication process where the client_id (a four-digit
    number found in your Stitch Dashboard URL) is used in the request body during
    the second authentication step.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer <access-token> header is required for requests to the Validate
    and Upsert endpoints. The access token should be passed in the Authorization header
    with the Bearer scheme. Additionally, the Content-Type header must be set to application/json
    for the request body.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access-token>". The request body must include client_id, table_name,
    sequence, action, key_names, and data fields.
