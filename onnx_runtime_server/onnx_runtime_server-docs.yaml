auth_info:
- information_source; https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchproject/opensearch:
  - OpenSearch uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a username and password. The default
    username is "admin". For OpenSearch 2.12 and earlier, the default password is
    "admin". For OpenSearch 2.12 and later, a custom password must be set via the
    OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable during setup. Credentials
    are passed in the Authorization header using the format "-ku admin:<password>"
    in curl requests, which translates to Basic Auth encoding.
