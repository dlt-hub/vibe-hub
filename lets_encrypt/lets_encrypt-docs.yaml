  - ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) uses JWS (JSON Web Signature)
    authentication. Requests must include a Content-Type header set to application/jose+json
    with a JSON payload containing protected header (base64url-encoded, includes algorithm,
    key ID, and nonce) and payload fields. The Replay-Nonce header from the previous
    response must be included in the protected header's nonce field to prevent replay
    attacks.
