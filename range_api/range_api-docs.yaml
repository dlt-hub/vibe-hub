auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.range.co/docs/api:
  - Range supports two authentication methods. First, API keys associated with user
    accounts can be passed using basic authentication with the API key as the username
    and an empty password (e.g., curl https://api.range.co/v1/teams -u $API_KEY:).
    Second, OAuth bearer tokens are supported for authenticating apps on behalf of
    other users, though OAuth Apps are currently in a closed program. All requests
    require HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher and will fail without authentication. API
    keys carry the same privileges as the associated user account and should be kept
    secure.
