auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/:
  - Cirium Flex APIs require authentication using application credentials consisting
    of an app id and app key. These credentials must be provided when submitting requests
    through the interactive documentation test client, and should be pre-populated
    by clicking the app id & key option in the request form.
- information_source; https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/how_to:
  - 'Each service invocation requires an application ID (appId) and application key
    (appKey) as query parameters. For REST APIs, pass credentials as query parameters:
    appId=your_app_id and appKey=your_app_key appended to the request URL. For SOAP
    APIs, credentials are included as fields in the request body.'
- information_source; https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/airlines/v1:
  - Authorization failure is mentioned in the 403 response, which indicates that 'appId'
    and 'appKey' are required credentials. These appear to be request parameters or
    headers used for authentication, though the documentation does not explicitly
    specify their exact transmission method (headers vs. query parameters) or the
    precise header/parameter names to use.
- information_source; https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/airports/v1:
  - API key authentication is required via query parameters. Send appId and appKey
    as query string parameters; a 403 response indicates authorization failure due
    to invalid appId, appKey, or rate limit violation.
  - 'API key authentication is required via two query parameters: appId (Application
    ID) and appKey (Application key). Both must be provided in the query string of
    each request. Authorization failures occur when appId or appKey are invalid or
    when rate limits are exceeded.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/trips/api:
  - Use the maxAlerts query parameter (optional, default=1, max=100) to control how
    many alerts are returned per call. The peek query parameter (optional boolean)
    allows retrieving alerts without advancing the internal cursor position. Use the
    /alerts/reset endpoint with a timestamp parameter to reposition the cursor to
    a specific point in time for subsequent alert retrievals.
