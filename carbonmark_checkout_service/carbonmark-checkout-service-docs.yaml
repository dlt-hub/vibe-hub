notes:
- The Carbonmark API Checkout Service is currently a beta product (limited release)
  and not in general availability.
- The /carbonProjects endpoint is now paginated.
- Deprecated June 4, 2025
- Supported until September 4, 2025
- Retired April 29th, 2025. No longer supported.
- You can create a sandbox key for testing purposes.
- The Retirement API is currently in beta.
- The API Key is sensitive and can be used to create costly retirements on your behalf.
- These permissions do not give Carbonmark the permission to unilaterally transfer
  credits on your behalf from your ICR account. You will still need to approve requested
  credit transfers to your Carbonmark account from your ICR organization.
- This transaction is irreversible. Ensure you are connected to the correct ICR account
  before issuing a credit transfer.
- You must have a Puro account in order to use the bridge.
- Automatic transaction approval must be set to use the bridge.
- This page is a work in progress.
