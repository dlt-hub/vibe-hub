  - Bearer Token authentication is required. After logging in via POST /login/, a
    Bearer Token is provided in the response. Include this token in the Authorization
    header using the format "Bearer {token}" to authorize subsequent requests. Authorization
    must be revalidated after each page reload.
  - 'Bearer Token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all API requests to endpoints like
    /me/, /users/, /workstations/, and /reports/.'
  - 'The API supports two authorization methods. First, Application Key authorization
    for server-to-server requests: include the API key with "key" prefix in the Authorization
    header (example: "key 23097e83-c473-49a3-b268-53c4fb712257"). Second, Bearer Token
    authorization for user-specific access: obtain a token by sending a POST request
    to the Login endpoint with username and password in the request body, then include
    the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent requests.'
