notes:
- Uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL for data storage
- Deployment on Heroku for back-end REST services
- FlyData will compress and transfer up to 5GB of log data every month for free.
- Deciding to use JOOQ early on was one of the best project decisions I’ve made.
- Financial independence is prioritized and pursued.
- Money should be treated like health. It’s a necessity of life.
- Invest your money. Do not let it sit idle in a bank.
- Home-ownership is the biggest financial decision you’ll make.
- Always aim for excellence and put yourself in situations where you can learn and
  grow.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The code is no longer a living system, but a museum artifact.
- Quantifying performance was a priority for us at the startup.
- Use of velocity metrics for performance discussions.
- There’s a slight error in the article.
- Saying that a task will take '3 weeks' or '15 days' can create a false illusion
  of precision.
- Uses random inputs to increase test coverage
- Conciseness in test-codebase is extremely valuable
- What was supposed to be a 2 month project, ended up taking 7 months instead.
- Feature flags can help manage complex epics and mitigate problems in deployments.
- Risk management should not overly rely on feature flags.
- This essay is intended to be descriptive of my personal experiences and memories
  as an immigrant.
- The visa itself is only required to enter the country. Once you’ve entered the country,
  there is a different process for remaining 'in-status'.
- The F-1 visa has no such restriction as the J-1 visa.
- There is a combined 12-month limit across all 4 years of your undergraduate program
  for Curricular Practical Training (CPT).
- Uses a lottery system for visa applications
- Requires employer sponsorship
- The immigration system has long wait times for applicants from certain countries.
- The PERM certification process is a requirement for employment-based green cards.
- Everything will eventually need to be updated.
- For any mission-critical system, neglect will only tradeoff smaller transient risk,
  for permanent catastrophic risk.
- Tech debt can’t be solved as a roadmap item. It needs to be part of your daily routine.
- Inter-disciplinary conflicts and snobbery are an easy trap to fall into.
- Organizations succeed when everyone recognizes the unique value their colleagues
  bring.
- Everyone’s hiring practices are broken, and yours aren’t any better.
- Mutation Driven Testing emphasizes identifying and fixing coverage holes in test
  suites.
- Don't make random changes until something starts working.
- Focus on understanding the root cause of problems.
- The prior is hugely influential when you have very few data points.
