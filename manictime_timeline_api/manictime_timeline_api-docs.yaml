  - 'Access tokens are obtained via OAuth2 OpenID Connect flow and must be included
    in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with each API request. Access tokens
    expire after one hour and can be refreshed using the refresh_token grant type
    at the token_endpoint URL from the OpenID Connect configuration.


    Include the access token in requests as: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>


    The refresh flow uses grant_type=refresh_token parameter with the refresh_token
    value obtained during initial authentication. The token_endpoint is retrieved
    from the OpenID Connect configuration and supports scopes including openid, profile,
    manictimeapi, and offline_access.'
  - 'OAuth2 refresh token flow using POST to manictime.com/connect/token with application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    body parameters. Required parameters: grant_type set to "refresh_token", refresh_token
    (obtained from initial authentication), client_id (from API client management),
    and client_secret (from API client management). Response returns access_token
    with Bearer token_type, id_token, expires_in (3600 seconds), new refresh_token,
    and scope "openid profile manictimeapi offline_access". Use the returned access_token
    in Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>" for subsequent API requests.'

    token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme: Authorization: Bearer

  - 'OAuth2 password grant flow is used for authentication. First, make an unauthenticated
    GET request to the API root to discover the token endpoint URL from the WWW-Authenticate
    header and links response. Then POST to the token endpoint with grant_type=password,
    username, and password as form-encoded body parameters to receive an access_token.
    Include the access token in subsequent API calls using the Authorization header
    with Bearer scheme: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>.'
