    apiKey query parameter (GET requests) or in the JSON request body (POST requests).

    parameter is required and must be obtained from the My products page; include
    it in the POST request body alongside other parameters like domains and outputFormat.

    an access token via POST to https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/oauth/token with Authorization
    header containing a base64-encoded credential, then use the returned accessToken
    in place of the apiKey parameter for API requests. Access tokens expire after
    1800, 3600 (default), 7200, or 10800 seconds and cannot be refreshed.

    parameter is required and should contain your personal API key obtained from the
    My products page. The response returns a new apiKey value in JSON or XML format.
