In this guide, we'll set up a complete Career Site Integration data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def career_site_integration_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://{ENDPOINT}/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
,
        },
        "resources": [
            "job_seeker_event_report",
            "jobs_applied_activity",
            "job_alert_activity"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='career_site_integration_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='career_site_integration_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(career_site_integration_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from career_site_integration‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Event Tracking: Provides endpoints for reporting events related to job seekers and recruiters.
- Career Integration: Includes endpoints for tracking jobs applied activity, job alert activity, and resume activity.
- Auto-complete: Offers an endpoint for location-based auto-completion, aiding in searches or form entries.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Career Site Integration workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@career_site_integration-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Career Site Integration support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:career_site_integration duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@career_site_integration-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Career Site Integration API, as specified in @career_site_integration-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "job_seeker_event_report" and "jobs_applied_activity" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in career_site_integration_pipeline.py and name the pipeline career_site_integration_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python career_site_integration_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    The authentication uses OAuth2 with a bearer token. The token is passed in the header of each request.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.example.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python career_site_integration_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline career_site_integration load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset career_site_integration_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/career_site_integration.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline career_site_integration_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("career_site_integration_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "job_seeker_event_report" table as Pandas frame
   data."job_seeker_event_report".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Common HTTP errors include 400 for invalid requests, 401 for unauthorized access due to invalid API keys, 403 for restricted access, 404 for non-existent APIs, 405 for using an invalid method, 500 for server-side errors, and 503 indicating the API is temporarily offline for maintenance.
