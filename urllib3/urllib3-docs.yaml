notes:
- Python version must be 3.9 or later
- Removed support for non-OpenSSL TLS libraries
- Changed the default minimum TLS version to TLS 1.2
- By default certificate verification is handled by urllib3 to support legacy Python
  versions
- You can use OS-provided certificates if desired. Just specify the full path to the
  certificate bundle as the `ca_certs` argument instead of `certifi.where()`.
- If you are using the standard library logging module urllib3 will emit several logs.
  In some cases this can be undesirable.
- When using preload_content=False, you need to manually release the HTTP connection
  back to the connection pool.
- Making unverified HTTPS requests is strongly discouraged.
- Zstandard support in urllib3 requires using v0.18.0 or later of the zstandard package.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Support for Emscripten and Pyodide is experimental
- urllib3 is packaged with the default Pyodide build, so you should be able to use
  it as normal
- This module was no longer recommended.
- It is recommended to use socks5h:// or socks4a:// schemes in your proxy_url to ensure
  that DNS resolution is done from the remote server instead of client-side when connecting
  to a domain name.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- urllib3 v2.0 will drop support for Python 2.
- 'Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Connections that receive a `DeprecationWarning` will
  fail.'
- 'Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Deprecated options will be removed.'
- Added `PoolManager` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and documented).
- Added `ProxyManager` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works with HTTPS
  proxies).
- Added optional partial-read support for responses when `preload_content=False`.
  You can now make requests and just read the headers without loading the content.
- Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).
- Added optional explicit boundary string for `encode_multipart_formdata`.
- Convenience request methods are now inherited from `RequestMethods`. Old helpers
  like `get_url` and `post_url` should be abandoned in favour of the new `request(method,
  url, ...)`.
- Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.
- License header added to `.py` files.
- 'Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code and
  docs in `docs/` and on <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/>.'
- Embettered all the things!
- Started writing this file.
- Changed the default request body encoding from 'ISO-8859-1' to 'UTF-8'
- urllib3 is a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
