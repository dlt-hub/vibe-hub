auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.payhawk.com/en/articles/8957381-overview-of-the-payhawk-developer-api:
  - API key authentication is required. Obtain the API key from Settings > Integrations
    > API Keys in the Payhawk portal, then include it when making requests to the
    Payhawk API endpoints. The Account ID from the portal URL is also needed to construct
    API endpoints (e.g., payhawk_demo_6fc0db9a).
  - API key authentication. Include the API key in the request headers to authenticate
    with the Payhawk Developer API. The API key is obtained from Settings > Integrations
    > API Keys in the Payhawk portal and must be enabled before use.
  - Payhawk uses RSA-signed SHA256 signatures for webhook authentication. The signature
    is sent in the X-Payhawk-Signature header, and verification requires fetching
    the public key from https://api.payhawk.io/api/v2/rsa-public-key to decrypt and
    validate the request payload.
  - 'The Payhawk API uses two distinct authentication mechanisms depending on the
    context:


    For webhook verification, requests include an RSA signature in a header (exact
    header name not specified in excerpt). The signature is computed over a data string
    formatted as timestampString:url:payload, verified against a public key fetched
    from https://api.payhawk.io/api/v2/rsa-public-key. For API queries to expense
    records, use an API key obtained from Settings > Integrations > API Keys in the
    Payhawk portal, sent as a request header (exact header name not specified). Include
    the Account ID from your portal URL (format: payhawk_demo_XXXXXX) in the request
    path. The exact header name for the API key and the timestamp header name for
    webhook verification are not explicitly stated in the provided documentation.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.payhawk.com/en/articles/8957381-overview-of-the-payhawk-developer-api:
  - Pagination uses Skip and Take parameters in query string. Skip specifies the number
    of records to skip, Take specifies how many records to return per request (page
    size is 1000 maximum). Stop paginating when fewer records than Take are returned.
  - Pagination uses query parameters $skip and $take. Default page size is 1000 results
    per request. Pass $skip to specify the offset and $take to specify the number
    of results to return in each request.
