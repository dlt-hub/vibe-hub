notes:
- YAML should be easily readable by humans.
- YAML data should be portable between programming languages.
- YAML should match the native data structures of dynamic languages.
- YAML should have a consistent model to support generic tools.
- YAML should support one-pass processing.
- YAML should be expressive and extensible.
- YAML should be easy to implement and use.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Directives are instructions to the YAML processor.
- It is an error to specify more than one 'YAML' directive for the same document.
- YAML’s block styles employ indentation rather than indicators to denote structure.
- For readability, block collections styles are not denoted by any indicator.
- Uses explicit document markers to distinguish between different types of documents.
- A bare document does not begin with any directives or marker lines.
- YAML is designed to be human-friendly and work well with modern programming languages.
- The recommended output encoding is UTF-8.
- If another encoding is used, it is recommended that an explicit byte order mark
  be used.
- A YAML stream may contain several independent YAML documents.
- When folding is done, a single normalized line feed is converted to a single space.
- When two or more consecutive normalized line feeds are encountered, the processor
  does not convert them into spaces.
- The combined effect of the processing rules above is that each 'paragraph' is interpreted
  as a single line, empty lines are used to represent a line feed, and 'more indented'
  lines are preserved.
- Specific line breaks may be safely used to indicate text structure.
- YAML is both a text format and a method for representing native language data structures.
- YAML representations model the data constructs from agile programming languages.
- YAML specification v1.2.2 defines the YAML 1.2 data language.
- This revision makes no actual changes to YAML but corrects errors and adds clarity.
- YAML processor can compose complete representations for recognized tags.
- The YAML specification is often seen as overly complicated for something which appears
  to be so simple.
- YAML achieves a unique cleanness by minimizing the amount of structural characters
  and allowing the data to show itself in a natural and meaningful way.
- Changed the source format from DocBook to Markdown in hopes of lowering the bar
  to entry for public contribution.
- Images are now all generated from simple LaTeX files into SVG, requiring no proprietary
  drawing software.
