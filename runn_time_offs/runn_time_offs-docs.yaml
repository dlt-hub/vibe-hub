pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.runn.io/docs/pagination:
  - Collection endpoints use cursor-based pagination with a default limit of 50 items,
    increasable to 200 via the `limit` query parameter. The response includes a `nextCursor`
    property in the JSON body; use this value as the `cursor` parameter in the next
    request to fetch subsequent pages, and stop when `nextCursor` is absent.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. Pass the `nextCursor` value from the
    response as the `cursor` query parameter in the next request. Stop paginating
    when `nextCursor` is null.
