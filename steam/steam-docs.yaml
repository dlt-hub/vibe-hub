  - Every request to the partner Steam Web API server at https://partner.steam-api.com
    must include a publisher Web API key. The key should be passed as a query parameter
    (standard practice for Steam Web API). Requests without a valid publisher key
    will return a 403 error, and repeated 403 responses from an IP will trigger strict
    rate limiting and potential IP denylisting.
