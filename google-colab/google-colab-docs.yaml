notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- All users have free access to most popular LLMs, while paid users have access to
  a wider selection of models.
- API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named 'GEMINI_API_KEY'.
- Use of function calling is demonstrated in the SDK.
- The state of the video is important. The video must finish processing, so do check
  the state. Once the state of the video is ACTIVE, you're able to pass it into generate_content.
- The Gemini API uses API keys for authentication.
- Remember to treat your API key like a password.
- For the Gemini 2.5 Flash, the budgets can be between 0 (disabling the thinking process)
  to 24576.
- For the Gemini 2.5 Pro, the budgets can be between 128 and 32768.
- The Search tool can be used in a live streaming context.
- Requires API key stored in Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY.
- Client version must be set to v1alpha.
- API key must be enabled for the Google Maps Static API.
- Performance in this example depends on your feedback to get the output perfect.
- Requires API key stored in Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Always disable the thinking configuration, as it adds latency without improving
  the results.
- The File API accepts files under 2GB in size and can store up to 20GB of files per
  project.
- Files last for 2 days and cannot be downloaded from the API.
- Uploaded files are associated with the API key's cloud project.
- Files are stored for 48 hours and can be accessed with your API key for generation
  within that time period.
- The maximum request size is 20 MB, which includes text prompts, system instructions,
  and files provided inline.
- To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named
  GOOGLE_API_KEY.
- Image generation is a paid-only feature and won't work if you are on the free tier.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Gemini
- Requires setup of Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY.
- API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY
- 'Supports various task types for embeddings: SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY, RETRIEVAL_QUERY,
  RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT, CLASSIFICATION, CLUSTERING.'
- This notebook requires paid tier rate limits to run properly.
- These are found at depths as great as 6,000 meters (20,000 ft).
- The genome of the extremophile Deinococcus from Challenger Deep has sequenced for
  its ecological insights and potential industrial uses.
- Because trenches are the lowest points in the ocean floor, there is concern that
  plastic debris may accumulate in trenches and endanger the fragile trench biomes.
- t-SNE is good at clustering inputs, but can take a longer time to converge or might
  get stuck at local minima.
- The Live API is in preview.
- Some features of the API are not working in Colab.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Uses API key stored in Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY
- The API provides Google Search, Code Execution and Function Calling tools.
- Support in the SDK is still under construction.
- Default behavior is blocking unless specified otherwise.
- The behavior is set as NON_BLOCKING, which means it will use async function calling.
- The scheduling behavior is 'Silent', meaning the model won't notify when the function
  call is finished.
- To run the following cell, your API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
- Realtime audio processing supported through Colab.
- On first try it will typically throw an error and ask for permission to record audio,
  if that happens allow audio, and run it again.
- To run this API, store your API key in a Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY.
- Points and 3D bounding boxes are experimental. Use 2D bounding boxes for higher
  accuracy.
- Multiview correspondence is an experimental feature, which will further improve
  in future versions.
- 3D bounding boxes is a new experimental feature from Gemini 2.0 that will continue
  to improve in future models.
- API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'.
- Search tool is a paid only feature and does not work with a free tier API key.
- You'll need an API key stored in an environment variable to run this notebook.
- The File API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a per-file maximum
  size of 2 GB.
- Files are stored for 48 hours.
- Gemini 2.0 models require explicit ordering of keys in structured output schemas.
- Colaboratory is integrated with Google Drive for sharing and collaboration.
- Public data sets made available on NYC Open Data are provided for informational
  purposes.
- Operations supported by cuDF will be very fast.
- Operations not supported by cuDF will be slower, as they fall back to using Pandas.
- Dataset is a subset of the USA 514 Stocks Prices NASDAQ NYSE dataset from Kaggle.
- This demo shows the impact of GPU-acceleration for common operations.
- Uses Keras API for building models
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Colab can load public github notebooks directly, with no required authorization
  step.
- Loading a notebook from a private GitHub repository requires authorization.
- You can also include Markdown in forms.
- Colab supports the core set of Jupyter Widgets for providing interactions between
  Python and the browser.
- Requires authentication to access Google Drive files
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Uses cuML's accelerator for improved performance on scikit-learn models
- Some algorithms may fall back to CPU if not supported on GPU
- Training loss should steadily decrease, steeply at first, and then more slowly until
  the slope of the curve reaches or approaches zero.
- If the training loss does not converge, train for more epochs.
- Most machine learning problems require a lot of hyperparameter tuning.
- The ideal combination of hyperparameters is data dependent, so you must always experiment
  and verify.
- The notebook requires 8 devices to run.
