auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.autoinvoice.visma.com/integration-guide/:
  - 'Access tokens are passed via the data-token attribute in the HTML embed, containing
    a JWT (example: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...). Tokens expire after one hour and cannot
    be renewed during the session, requiring a page refresh to re-authenticate. For
    iframe embedding, tokens are obtained from https://ax-stage.maventa.com (testing)
    or https://ax.maventa.com (production) endpoints, then used to initiate sessions
    via https://autointerface endpoints.'
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain an access token. POST to the
    token endpoint (https://ax-stage.maventa.com/oauth2/token for testing or https://ax.maventa.com/oauth2/token
    for production) with multipart/form-data containing grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id (company_uuid value), client_secret (user_api_key value), scope=eui,
    and vendor_api_key (erp_vendor_api_key value). The response includes access_token
    (JWT), token_type=bearer, expires_in=3600, and scope=eui. Use the access_token
    in subsequent API requests as a bearer token.
  - Personal online banking credentials or Mobile ID are required to complete the
    KYC form. Authentication is facilitated through Netvisor KYC partner. KYC can
    be initiated via email link sent using the "authorization_email" parameter in
    the PUT /v2/services/amili/receivables call, or customers can access the "activation_url"
    link returned by GET /v2/services/amili/receivables to complete the process directly.
  - 'The API requires three authentication keys used in nearly all requests: user_api_key
    (identifies a user), company_uuid (identifies a company), and vendor_api_key (identifies
    a partner). In SOAP API, all three keys are provided on each request. In REST
    API, oauth2 standard tokens are used for authentication. Keys must be written
    exactly as provided with no extra whitespace. The vendor_api_key is mandatory
    for partner and ERP integrations to ensure correct billing, reporting, and support
    handling.'
  - 'You need to provide authentication using HTTP headers with one of two methods:
    either USERNAME and USERPW headers (credentials from Mass printing API account
    registration), or COMPANY-UUID and USER-API-KEY headers (credentials from AutoInvoice
    account).'
