pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.mydevices.com/docs/adminapi/admin-api-devices:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (number, to limit results per
    request) and cursor (string, to specify position for next page). The response
    body includes a timestamp field that, if present, indicates the cursor value to
    use in the next request to continue pagination.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0) and limit (default/example
    50) to request paginated results. The response includes count, page, limit, and
    rows fields; continue paginating by incrementing the page parameter until fewer
    results are returned than the limit.
- information_source; https://docs.mydevices.com/restapi/:
  - Page and limit are query parameters for pagination. Page is optional with default
    0, limit is optional with default 20 results per page. The response structure
    indicates page-based pagination, though specific response fields for navigation
    are not detailed in the documentation provided.
  - 'Page-based pagination using query parameters: page (optional, default 0) and
    limit (optional, default 100) control the request. Response includes pagination
    object with page, limit, and total fields to indicate current page, results per
    page, and total count.'
  - 'Page-based pagination with optional search. Request parameters: search (string,
    optional) for partial matching, page (number, optional, default 0) for page number,
    limit (number, optional, default 50) for results per page. Response contains applications
    array; construct next request by incrementing page parameter.'
