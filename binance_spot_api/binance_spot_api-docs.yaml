notes:
- Features that currently require an Ed25519 API key will soon be opened up to HMAC
  and RSA keys.
- The system now supports microseconds in all related time and/or timestamp fields.
  Microsecond support is opt-in.
- WebSocket services will send a ping frame every 20 seconds instead of 3 minutes.
- Timestamp parameters now reject values too far into the past or the future.
- WebSocket API allows placing orders, canceling orders, etc. through a WebSocket
  connection.
- WebSocket API is subject to the same Filter and Rate Limit rules as REST API.
- New API key type – Ed25519 – is now supported.
- Deprecated v1 endpoints and migrated to v3.
- Some responses may contain additional fields as of the latest updates.
- A single WebSocket connection can subscribe to multiple User Data Streams at once.
- Only one subscription per account is allowed on a single connection.
- Timestamp parameters reject values too far into the past or future.
- New field 'origQuoteOrderQty' added in responses for order placement.
- The system now supports microseconds in all related time and/or timestamp fields.
- A new optional parameter `timeUnit` can be used in the connection URL to select
  the time unit.
- Websocket API allows placing orders, canceling orders, etc. through a WebSocket
  connection.
- WebSocket API is a separate service from WebSocket Market Data streams.
- WebSocket API and REST API are functionally equivalent.
- Update Rate Limit to 1000/5min/IP on Market Data Endpoints
- Update Rate Limit to 500/5min/IP on Funding Rate and Funding Info Endpoints
- New endpoints available for income and portfolio margin exchange trading rules.
- Standard HTTP request formats are recommended.
- Support for travel rule requirements.
- 'New endpoint for Wallet: GET /sapi/v1/account/apiRestrictions to query user API
  Key permission'
- 'New endpoint for Wallet: POST /sapi/v1/asset/get-funding-asset to query funding
  wallet, includes Binance Pay, Binance Card, Binance Gift Card, Stock Token'
- The query time period must be less than 7 days.
- All endpoints return a common JSON object with 'code', 'message' and 'data', no
  matter if it's a success or not.
- All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.
- HTTP 5XX return codes are used for internal errors.
- For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
- Each request and response should be logged in both Binance and partner's sides for
  further investigation.
- 'default options.locale: ''en'''
- 'default options.width: 200'
- 'default options.theme: ''light'''
- 3rd party application uses oauth authentication to initiate the collection request,
  please contact Binance Merchant Operation to set up proper permissions of oauth
  client and refer to Binance OAuth2 Integration for oauth integration.
- Please refer to Webhook Common Rules for authentication of collection result notification.
- 需要 Ed25519 API 密钥才能使用的功能将很快会对 HMAC 和 RSA 密钥开放。
- 所有更改都将逐步推出，可能需要一周时间才能完成。
- 使用 Ed25519 类型的 API key以提高性能和安全性。
- 所有更改都将逐步推出到我们的所有服务器，并可能需要一周时间才能完成。
- WebSocket API 与 REST API 提供相同的功能，接受相同的参数，返回相同的状态和错误代码。
- 接口 GET /api/v3/ticker 与 GET /api/v3/ticker/24hr 变动，添加新可选参数 type
- Binance Login (Oauth2.0) is exclusively offered to close ecosystem partners.
- Only endpoints starting with /api/* are supported, /sapi/* is not supported.
- This will apply for both REST API and WebSocket API.
- The messages below can only be used for the FIX Order Entry and FIX Drop Copy Sessions.
- This API can only be used with the SPOT Exchange.
- FIX sessions only support Ed25519 keys.
- Must be the first message sent by the client.
- Logon can only be sent once for the entirety of the session.
- Orders must be specified in the sequence indicated in the *Order Names* column in
  the table below.
- FIX API should give better performance for ExecutionReport`<8>` push.

- A single connection to stream-sbe.binance.com is only valid for 24 hours
- WebSocket connections have a rate limit of 5 requests per second
- There is a limit of 300 connection attempts every 5 minutes per IP address
- A single connection to stream.binance.com is only valid for 24 hours; expect to
  be disconnected at the 24 hour mark.
- Responses are in JSON by default.
- Data is returned in chronological order.
- All time and timestamp related fields in the JSON responses are in milliseconds
  by default.
- A single connection to the API is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected
  after the 24-hour mark.
- All timestamps in the JSON responses are in milliseconds in UTC by default.
- Requires API key for access.
- Uses API key authentication.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- 'New Base url wss://margin-stream.binance.com for two events: Liability update event
  and Margin call event'
- Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.

  time.
- API may return nulls in certain fields under specific conditions.
- Some endpoints will require an API Key.
- It is recommended to set IP restrictions on the key for security reasons.
- The API system is asynchronous, so some delay in the response is normal and expected.
- Every request will contain X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) in the
  response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate
  limiters defined.
- To enable withdrawals via the API, the API key restriction needs to be modified
  through the Binance UI.
