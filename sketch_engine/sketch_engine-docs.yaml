auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/api-documentation/:
  - API key authentication is required. The API key must be obtained from the Sketch
    Engine user account interface (My account section) and is used to authenticate
    requests when creating corpora via the API.
  - Basic authentication using username and API key passed as a tuple to the requests
    library auth parameter. The credentials are username ('%username%') and API key
    ('%api_key%'), sent via HTTP Basic Auth with each request to https://api.sketchengine.eu/ca/api.
  - Sketch Engine API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed as a
    tuple (USERNAME, API_KEY) to the auth parameter in requests.get(). The USERNAME
    and API_KEY variables must be populated with valid credentials obtained from Sketch
    Engine.
  - Sketch Engine API uses either Bearer token or Basic authentication. The API key
    is generated from the user account dashboard and must be sent in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer API_KEY", or alternatively as Basic auth with username as login
    and API key as password.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are provided via the --user
    flag in the format USERNAME:APIKEY, which sends the Authorization header with
    base64-encoded credentials in the request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/api-documentation/:
  - Pagination uses pagesize query parameter to control results per page. Response
    includes concsize (number of hits) and numofpages (total pages). Use pagesize
    to set desired page length; construct subsequent requests with appropriate pagesize
    values to retrieve different pages.
