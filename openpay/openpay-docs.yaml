auth_info:
- information_source; https://documents.openpay.mx/docs/api/:
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a secret key. The secret key (e.g.,
    sk_e568c42a6c384b7ab02cd47d2e407cab) is passed as the username in the Authorization
    header with an empty password, formatted as username:password in base64 encoding
    for HTTP Basic Auth. In curl, this is specified with the -u flag followed by the
    key and a colon.
- information_source; https://documents.openpay.mx/docs/c.html/:
  - 'Openpay API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with merchant credentials. Authentication
    requires two credentials: a secret key (sk_...) and a merchant ID, which are sent
    as the username and password in the HTTP Authorization header using Basic Auth
    scheme. Separate credentials are provided for sandbox (https://sandbox-api.openpay.mx)
    and production (https://api.openpay.mx) environments. The secret key format is
    sk_[alphanumeric], and the merchant ID is a string like moiep6umtcnanql3jrxp.
    Include these in the Authorization header as "Basic base64(secret_key:merchant_id)".'
- information_source; https://documents.openpay.mx/en/api-reference-php/:
  - 'Openpay API uses HTTP Basic Authentication where the API key (obtained from the
    dashboard) is sent as the username and the password field is left blank. There
    are two types of keys: Private keys for server-to-server calls with full API access,
    and Public keys for JavaScript calls limited to card/token creation. The merchant
    identifier is included in the endpoint URI path.'

  - 'API authentication uses HTTP Basic Access Authentication where the API key (obtained
    from the dashboard) is the username and the password field is left blank. Two
    types of API keys exist: Private keys for server-to-server calls with full access,
    and Public keys for JavaScript calls limited to card/token creation. The API key
    must be sent in all requests to the base URI https://api.openpay.mx.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication is used, with the API key as the username and an empty
    password. Send the API key (e.g. sk_e568c42a6c384b7ab02cd47d2e407cab) in the Authorization
    header using basic auth format, or pass it with a colon as the -u parameter in
    curl requests.
