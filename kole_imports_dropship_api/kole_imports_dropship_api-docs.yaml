auth_info:
- information_source; http://support.koleimports.com/kb/dropship-api-documentation/api-orders:
  - Basic authentication is required using an Authorization header with the format
    "Basic {id}:{api_key}", where id and api_key are base64-encoded credentials provided
    by the API provider.
  - Basic authentication is required using an ID and API key embedded in the URL as
    credentials. The format is https://{id}:{api_key}@api.koleimports.com/orders,
    where id and api_key are your authentication credentials placed before the domain
    in the URL authority section.
  - Basic authentication is required using an id and api_key pair. Credentials are
    sent via the Authorization header as "Basic {id}:{api_key}" or embedded in the
    URL as "https://{id}:{api_key}@api.koleimports.com". The id and api_key values
    must be base64-encoded when using the Authorization header per HTTP Basic Auth
    standards.
  - The API requires Authorization header authentication. Requests must include the
    Authorization header (exact name not specified in documentation, but listed as
    a required Request Header). The documentation does not provide explicit details
    on the authorization scheme format, token type, or how to obtain credentials.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an id and api_key. Credentials are
    passed either in the Authorization header as "Basic {id}:{api_key}" or embedded
    in the URL as "https://{id}:{api_key}@api.koleimports.com".
