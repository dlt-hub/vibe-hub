auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.cyphermed.cloud/v2/docs:

    via the Authorization header using the appropriate scheme for your chosen method.

    in the Authorization header as a bearer token. The exact header format and token
    acquisition method are not specified in this documentation excerpt.
  - AccessToken is required for authorization. Send it as an authorization credential
    in the request headers when calling the Set Dashboard Config endpoint.
  - 'AccessToken or ApiKey authentication is required. AccessToken should be sent
    as a Bearer token in the Authorization header (Authorization: Bearer <access_token>),
    or ApiKey should be sent as an API key, typically in the X-API-Key header or as
    a query parameter named api_key.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.cyphermed.cloud/v2/docs:
  - Pagination uses limit as a query parameter to control result set size. The response
    includes page_count and object_count fields to indicate pagination state, though
    specific navigation fields like next or cursor are not detailed in the documentation
    excerpt provided.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: request with page query parameter (optional,
    default 0), and response includes page_count and object_count fields to determine
    total pages and stop when current page exceeds page_count.'
  - The response includes pagination support through the "last_evaluated_key" field,
    which should be used as the starting point for the next request to retrieve additional
    results. The "object_count" field indicates how many objects are returned in the
    current response.
