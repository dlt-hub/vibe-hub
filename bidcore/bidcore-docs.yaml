auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bidcore.iponweb.com/api/workflow.html:
  - OAuth2 password grant flow authentication. POST to https://uauth.iponweb.com/oauth2/token/
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded and payload containing grant_type="password",
    username (BidCore login), password (BidCore password), and scope="service_id=my.bidcore.iponweb.com".
    Response includes access_token and token_type="Bearer". Use the access_token as
    a Bearer token in subsequent API requests.
  - The API uses OAuth2 password grant flow for authentication. To obtain an access
    token, make a POST request to https://uauth.iponweb.com/oauth2/token/ with grant_type=password,
    username, password, and scope parameters in the request body. The returned access
    token must then be passed in request headers for subsequent API requests. Permanent
    tokens can also be generated and used directly in request headers.
  - To authenticate with the Workflow API, obtain a permanent OAuth2 access token
    from the IPONWEB single sign-on portal at https://uauth.iponweb.com/uauth/settings/#sso
    by selecting OAuth2 Access Token and creating a new permanent token with the scope
    my.bidcore.iponweb.com. Send the token in API requests as a Bearer token in the
    Authorization header.
- information_source; https://docs.bidcore.iponweb.com/public-features/shared/reporting-api.html:
  - 'All POST requests to u-Slicer endpoints require three fields in the JSON request
    body: slicer_name (customer-specific instance name), project_name (customer-specific
    project name), and token (authorization token obtained from https://uauth.iponweb.com/uauth/settings/
    using the uslicer.iponweb.com scope). The token is passed as a field in the request
    payload, not as a header.'
  - OAuth2 password grant flow is required. Make a POST request to https://uauth.iponweb.com/oauth2/token/
    with grant_type=password, username (IPONWEB LDAP login), password (IPONWEB LDAP
    password), and scope=service_id=uslicer.iponweb.com. Use the returned access_token
    in subsequent API requests.
