  - 'Monetization API uses Bearer Token authentication. First, execute an Authentication
    request with username, password, and site_code to the /authenticate endpoint to
    obtain a token. Then set the Authorization header to "Bearer <token>" in subsequent
    API requests. The token expires after 5 minutes. Authentication request requires
    Content-Type: application/json header and a JSON body with username, password,
    and site_code fields. Payment import requests require the Authorization header
    with the Bearer token and a Data-Type: Payment header.'
  - Synchronous payment processing with a third-party payment provider requires Bearer
    token authentication. Send the Authorization header with value "Bearer {{auth_token}}"
    when creating a Payment Gateway Profile via the Monetization REST API at the /api/v1/payment-gateway-profiles
    endpoint.
