auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.netx.as/docs/api/api.html:
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are provided via the -u flag
    in curl (or Authorization header) in the format username:password, sent as a base64-encoded
    string in the Authorization header with the "Basic" scheme. For example, curl
    -X POST -u user:password https://<netx-address>/api/interface/lo2 sends the credentials
    user:password encoded in the request.
  - The access to the API is protected via standard HTTP Authentication using the
    HTTP Authorization header with the same username and password as SSH access, or
    via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Refer to the token-based authentication tutorial for
    JWT details.
- information_source; https://docs.netx.as/tutorials/api/token.html:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required for REST API requests. Obtain a token
    from the api-oauth endpoint, then include it in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" for all subsequent API calls.'
  - To obtain a token, provide valid username and password credentials via HTTP basic
    authentication to the /token endpoint, which returns a JSON object containing
    a token string. To refresh or create a new token, send a POST request to /api-oauth/system/user/{username}/api/create-token
    with the Authorization header set to Bearer followed by the token value.
  - Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Create a user without
    a password, then use the `create-token` command to generate a JWT token. Send
    the token in the HTTP Authorization header for API requests.
