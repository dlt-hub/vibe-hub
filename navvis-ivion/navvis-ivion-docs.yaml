notes:
- NavVis M6 will no longer be supported by NavVis support or service engineers after
  December 31, 2024.
- Ensure all processed datasets are downloaded in January 2025 for safekeeping.
- Orthophotos over 4GB can now be exported.
- Fixed an issue where too many panorama requests were sent to the server, which caused
  performance issues.
- Exclude ID when copying, as that is not writable.
- Users that only belong to the EVERYONE group do not have permission to edit POIs
  but are still able to view them.
- The NavVis Knowledge Base is a central repository that contains in-depth technical
  information about all NavVis products.
- Ensure that the batteries are fully charged, the memory is correctly formatted and
  has sufficient space, the cameras and scanners are cleaned, and the device software
  is updated to the latest version.
- The Support Portal’s User management and the Management of the users of a IVION
  Instance are independent from each other.
- In general only people from a organization that own a NavVis device or Software
  need access to the Support Portal.
