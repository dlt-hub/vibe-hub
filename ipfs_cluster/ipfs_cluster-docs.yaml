auth_info:
- information_source; https://ipfscluster.io/documentation/reference/api/:
  - 'The REST API supports both Basic and JWT token authentication. Basic Authentication
    credentials are stored in the service.json configuration file under basic_auth_credentials.
    JWT token authentication requires sending an Authorization: Bearer <JWT-token>
    header; the access token is obtained by querying POST /token endpoint using Basic
    Auth credentials (username and password from basic_auth_credentials). The JWT
    token is tied to the requesting user and signed using their password; revocation
    requires changing or removing the original Basic Auth credentials and restarting
    ipfs-cluster-service.'
- information_source; https://ipfscluster.io/documentation/reference/pinsvc_api/:
  - JWT token authentication is required. Tokens are generated via POST /token endpoint.
    Tokens should be sent in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens per the IPFS
    Pinning Service API specification.
  - JWT token authentication is used to access the pinning service API. Tokens are
    generated via POST /token endpoint using Basic Authentication (username:password),
    which returns a JSON response with a "token" field. The JWT token is then passed
    as the secret access token when adding the pinning service. JWT tokens are tied
    to the user and signed with their password; revocation requires changing or removing
    the Basic Auth credentials in the basic_auth_credentials setting for the pinsvc
    API section and restarting ipfs-cluster-service.
