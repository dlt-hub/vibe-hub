auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.royaleapi.com/authentication:
  - Authentication requires passing an auth token in a custom header named "auth"
    with each request. The token value is provided as a string (e.g., "a1234.567.890")
    and must be included in the request headers.
  - 'The API uses a developer key-based authentication sent as a custom header. The
    key can be obtained from a Discord bot in the #developer-key channel by typing
    `?crapikey get`. Include the key in requests using either the `auth` header or
    the `Authorization: Bearer` header with the token value (format: a1234.567.890).
    Keys can be regenerated to invalidate existing ones.'
- information_source; https://docs.royaleapi.com/authentication.html:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send your developer key either in the `auth`
    header or in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Obtain your key from the Discord
    #developer-key channel by typing `?crapikey get` to receive it via direct message.'
  - 'Authentication is performed by including a custom `auth` header with your API
    token. Pass the token value directly in the `auth` header on all requests, for
    example `auth: a1234.567.890`.'
