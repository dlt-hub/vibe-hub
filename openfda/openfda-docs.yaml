auth_info:
- information_source; https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/:
  - 'An API key is required to access the openFDA API and can be passed as a query
    parameter or as HTTP basic authentication. Pass the API key as the `api_key` query
    parameter in the URL (e.g., `https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?api_key=yourAPIKeyHere`),
    or alternatively provide it as the username in an `Authorization: Basic` header
    with base64 encoding. All requests must use HTTPS. Rate limits are 240 requests
    per minute and 120,000 requests per day per API key.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://open.fda.gov/apis/paging/:
  - Pagination uses the Link header with rel="next" containing the URL for the next
    page, including a search_after query parameter. When the Link header is absent,
    you have reached the last page. The limit query parameter controls page size.
  - 'Use skip/limit parameters to page through results up to 26,000 hits. For larger
    datasets, use Search After feature: execute initial query without skip parameter,
    extract the Link HTTP header with rel="Next" URL from response to fetch subsequent
    pages, and stop when the Link header is absent indicating the last page.'
