notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Two-step verification protects against brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
- Private APIs are limited to members of the organization.
- Public APIs can be listed in the API Directory.
- Subscription-Id value must be active for the account.
- Requires setup of connected app in Fortellis
- Fortellis tokens expire in 3600 seconds, or 1 hour.
- Field Management process allows customization of fields exchanged through the API.
- Field Filtering gives App Consumers control of the information shared with a third-party
  app.
- A common and standardized authorization method used with all APIs
- Use OAuth and authorize with the implicit flow.
- Fortellis does not automatically feature new APIs or apps with an InVent event.
- You must have a ConnectCDK account before you can activate a Fortellis app.
- All requests to Fortellis APIs must contain required HTTP headers.
- Allows the consumer to opt out of having their data sold
- Provides a list of personal identifiable information (PII) collected about the consumer
- Explains why PII data is collected
- Upon request, removes the consumer’s PII data from the dealership’s database
- Event Relay is the Fortellis message broker that broadcasts event messages.
- Asynchronous APIs push event messages rather than returning responses in sequence
  to requests.
- Dealers using CDK Elead without a CDK Drive DMS also need to use ConnectCDK to Activate
  or Subscribe to a Fortellis app.
- The Consumer Privacy Protection (CPP) information icon is visible against an app
  only when the app has at least one API that is enabled with Consumer Privacy Protection
  functionality.
- Fortellis does not offer security for the authorization code flow and the implicit
  grant flow in the context of JavaScript apps and single page apps.
- Fortellis OAuth 2.0 authorization method uses the Fortellis identity server to mint
  new access tokens.
- Use tokens for 3600 seconds with no refresh tokens.
- Only use the implicit flow to control access between a Single-Page Application (SPA)
  and a resource server.
- In Fortellis apps, the authorization code flow is not secure in the context of JavaScript
  apps and single page apps.
- Tokens generated by the Fortellis identity server are passed in the authorization
  header of each request.
- Custom OAuth 2.0 authorization method
- Subscription-specific parameters can be configured
- Fortellis implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol
- You must have a Fortellis Sign in and be part of a verified organization to register
  a new app.
- Users residing in US have the provision to enter either a credit card or bank account
  while registering. However, users residing in Canada can register only credit cards
  as their payment method for now.
- Ensure that the provided payment method is valid and authorized for transactions.
- Users residing in US have the provision to enter either a credit card or bank account
  while registering.
- Users residing in Canada can register only credit cards as their payment method
  for now.

  the third-party payment gateway through which your payment is initiated.
- Fortellis does not save your account information but reflects the details from the
  third-party payment gateway through which your payment is initiated.
- If the Certification Fee payment fails, a transaction failure notification is shared
  on the date of payment.
- This payment method is currently available only for users in the USA.
- If your account is already used, you need not verify it the next time you are recertifying
  an app on Fortellis Marketplace.
- If the recertification Fee payment fails, a transaction failure notification is
  shared on the date of payment.
- You will receive three reminder emails within a 15-day duration from the payment
  failure date, failing to make the payment, your app will be cancelled and is removed
  from Fortellis Platform.
- All amounts mentioned above are exclusive of all taxes and the taxes are calculated
  based on the area zipcode.
- Only the users who have been granted access to an app are able activate the app
  and use it.
- You cannot remove APIs once you have created the listing in Marketplace.
- You must remove the app listing to prevent App Consumers from using the API.
- A listing fee is assessed when you initially publish the app and list it in the
  Fortellis Marketplace. The listing fee is a monthly recurring payment charged to
  the payment method configured for the App Publisher's account.
- Ensure all required fields are filled before submission
- If your app is subscription-based, you must enter a valid email address in the Subscription
  Notifications section before you can submit your app to the Marketplace.
- Fortellis does not currently provide billing services. To bill for your app, you
  must offer your own billing services.
- For Canada users, we have credit cards as the only payment method at this time.
- You must create and submit an app listing to list your app in Marketplace.
- Async APIs do not have a Test environment.
- The Status of the app must be Active before you can make Production calls using
  the Subscription ID.
- Before you can make calls to the Test environment, the API Publisher must enable
  the API in that environment.
- A Fortellis Administrator must Approve your app before you can publish it in Marketplace.
- You can withdraw an app that is currently published on Marketplace.
- Your Subscription-Id must be active in order to make calls to the API.
- You must add the API to the app in your developer account before you can access
  the test data.
- Get real Bearer tokens that Fortellis will accept in production
- Get a real Subscription-Id to use in the production environment
- Requests to the Admin API callback endpoints are free of charge.
- The Fortellis OAuth client credential flow is not secure in the context of JavaScript
  apps and single pages apps.
- You must send the user's Subscription-Id with a valid access token in the header
  of your API requests.
- In a real application, you would store the access token in the browser to send with
  every request to the API.
- If you use the client credentials in a production app, you cannot expose your API
  key and secret to users.
- Apps must be active before you can make API calls to the Production service and
  receive live data in responses.
- You must have a Subscription-Id in your request to get live data.
- Remember that you must associate the user with the Subscription-Id in this flow
  and send the Subscription-Id with the token to get a response from the API.
- The Fortellis OAuth client credentials flow is not secure in the context of JavaScript
  apps and single pages apps.
- The authorization code expires in 60 seconds.
- Remember that all actions taken with your token are attributable to you.
- Your users must have Fortellis credentials to use this authorization flow.
- Fortellis resolves all URLs to a secure connection, so you receive an error stating
  that the site cannot create a secure connection.
- Users must have Fortellis credentials to use this authorization flow.
- You must associate the user with the Subscription-Id in this flow and send the Subscription-Id
  with the token to get a response from the API.
- You must protect your credentials on the server side.
- Your users should never see your credentials.
- You must get your user's Subscription-Id and send it and the token in the header
  for the API to respond.
- Fortellis' implicit flow is not secure in the context of JavaScript apps and single-page
  apps.
- Your app credentials and token should always stay server side and used only for
  service-service communication with Fortellis.
- Your credentials should never be exposed to your clients or users.
- API Publishers can check user subscriptions at runtime, but this increases the latency
  of each call.
- API is private when initially registered
- To make the API available to others, share the private API with other organizations
  or make the API public
- You must create a new version of an API if you want to change the either the Environment
  or Namespace fields. You cannot modify these properties after the API has been registered.
- APIs hosted in the Production environment access live user data. However, API Publishers
  should not host live data in the Dev and Test environments. Instead, they should
  always use mock data in the testing environments.
- Once you selected a visibility to be private or public, you cannot change them again.
- If you create or edit a public plan to change the type, all the other public basic
  plans are automatically retired. For Rest APIs only, the Subscription and Transactional
  public plans of each type can co-exist.
- You can create any number of custom plans and can assign each custom plan to the
  organizations of your choice.
- Apps that are created using the Dealer Pricing Custom Plan cannot be made public.
- You can create only one Subscription with Overages Public Plan.
- Test Subscription ID is set to Pending by default upon creation.
- User activation method is set to Manual by default.
- API must provide a set of terms that API users can read and consent to before they
  can begin using the API.
- Private APIs are visible only to members of the organization where registered.
- To share a private API, enter the Entity ID of the organization in the Org ID input
  box.
- You must wait until Fortellis provisions the updated API before it becomes available.
- If you decide to not use the Admin API, be aware that you must get the user's subscription
  context at runtime.
- Fortellis gives you several tools to help you monitor the performance of your API,
  giving you the ability to increase user satisfaction by finding bugs and improving
  performance.
- The Performance Metrics page displays metrics for all the apps with active subscriptions
  to the API.
- Long-running operations can return 202 - Accepted response.
- Use the Operation ID value as a path parameter in long-running operation helper
  functions.
- SOAP APIs must include the complete SOAP XML envelope in the response payload.
- It's recommended to include a FORT-API-OPERATION response header to identify the
  method associated with the response.
- All requests made to a Fortellis API must have a valid Subscription ID plus an OAuth
  token for authorization.
- App users must have an active Subscription-Id before they can interact with an API
  via an app.
- Fortellis Async APIs are based on asynchronous event-driven architectures.
- The data owner must approve access grants for apps to receive messages from the
  async API.
- Currently the POST /deactivate endpoint is not supported for async APIs.
- Requests to the Admin API include an authorization token that can be verified against
  the public keys at the keys endpoint of the authorization server.
- Async API Publishers grant access to the applications that subscribe to their API.
- You can deactivate a currently active access grant.
- Fortellis hashes all tokens using the RS256 algorithm.
- The mock service automatically downloads npm when you start it.
- Create relatively discrete APIs that Apps can consume with little effort.
- 'You may not need to verify the Fortellis authorization token if you choose one
  of the following options when you register your app: External OAuth 2.0, Custom
  OAuth 2.0, Basic authorization, API Key and Secret.'
- You must use the correct Subscription-Id and a recently created token or you receive
  a forbidden error.
- You must now use your App Publisher credentials to get a token.
- You must have a Subscription-Id.
- Not subscribed
- You must also configure Maven to use Java 11 or Java 8.
- You must use the correct Subscription-Id and a recently created token or you receive
  an empty response body in the request.
- The server name should follow the format {"dev"|"uat"|"prod"}-{"http"}.
- You must use the URL https://event-relay.fortellis.io/v2/events for submitting AsyncAPI
  specs.
- You must have Fortellis OAuth security for your AsyncAPI spec.
- You can only use the option to fire and forget if you do not include the `partitionKey`
  in your asynchronous API header.
- API specification must accurately describe all public-facing inputs and outputs
  of the service.
- When you register the API, specify the target host for the service.
- Asynchronous API Publishers must send a partitionKey in the asynchronous API header
  for the Event Relay to send the events in order.
- Fortellis uses namespaces to ensure there are no endpoint conflicts between APIs
  in different organizations.
- The dev environment is available to only those in the organization in which the
  API is registered.
- When you make an API public, you can make your API available to all developers in
  Fortellis.
- Ensure the audience in the token is 'api_providers'.
- Use the connectionId as a path parameter in the callback request.
- Fortellis does not expect a reply in response to its POST notification.
- Ensure the audience in the token is api_providers.
- Ensure the audience in the token is api_providers
- Fortellis calls the `/activate` endpoint to indicate to the API Publisher that a
  Subscriber has requested a connection.
- You must register your API with Fortellis before you can test the API through the
  platform.
- Apps should include a unique Request-Id with every call in production, but you can
  test your API without the Request-Id.
- Uses OAuth2 authorization for API requests
- You must authorize requests to your `/activate` endpoint
- Token expires in one hour.
- The server may sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Log the connectionId to the console before reading the file.
- Use Postman or another API testing tool to get the connections that have been deactivated.
- Use the Postman collection that you get when you initially submit your API for testing.
- Make sure to get a new token when you are calling the deactivate endpoint.
- The Heroku server sleeps after 30 minutes.
- You must install Maven to complete this tutorial.
- Run the server using 'mvn jetty:run'.
- You must include a valid token when you send a new connection request to your endpoint.
- You can now get your connection requests, but for this tutorial, we do not protect
  or secure the endpoint in any way.
- You may want to validate the payload coming to your Admin API to ensure the data
  matches the schema that you have implemented, but we do not cover this in this tutorial.
- Fortellis sends the Admin API Fortellis tokens and not API Provider tokens.
- Client ID is required in the subject of the token.
- Asynchronous APIs send events to Fortellis when the asynchronous API system updates.
- You must make the endpoint publicly available to receive asynchronous API calls
  through Fortellis.
- Event Relay secures access for data publishers and API subscribers using the OAuth2
  protocol
- Data owners must consent to their data being released to an application's webhook,
  via an access grant
- Event Relay cannot guarantee the ordering of messages without a partitionKey being
  included in the message headers.
- If duplicates cannot be tolerated by the data consumer, incoming messages can be
  de-duped using the unique Event ID included in each message.
- Webhooks must be internet accessible and be designed to accommodate messages in
  the format described in the Async API Specification.
- Webhook must respond with a 202 - Accepted response to acknowledge receipt of messages.
- Fortellis retries sending messages until a proper acknowledgment is received.
- You can now create the asynchronous API producer for the asynchronous API spec.
- You must stop and start the server to get this step to work.
- Currently, a Fortellis Administrator must create the subscription to your app and
  activate it before your event sends events to your app webhook.
- Server runs on port 3001
- Events are saved to queue.json
- Fortellis appends the /event endpoint to the end of the URL and sends the event
  to that endpoint.
- Currently, a Fortellis Administrator must create the subscription to your app and
  activate it before an asynchronous API sends events to your app webhook.
- The on_modified command produces two events and sends both.
- Use a unique identifier for your partitionKey.
- Fortellis associates any events sent with that partitionKey with events on that
  partition.
- Fortellis uses the partitionKey to ensure your events are delivered in order.
- You can only send an event through the event relay to one organization at a time.
- You can receive information from an event with webhooks.
- Fortellis appends the events endpoint to the URL that you enter when you are registering
  your webhook endpoint.
- Python Anywhere disables the site after 3 months.
- Python Anywhere also only gives you 100 seconds of uptime every 24 hours.
- Fortellis sends a token with your credentials to your webhook when it sends an event
  to your endpoint.
- Verify that the credentials in the token are yours to authorize the request to your
  endpoint.
- You must also install Maven to complete this tutorial.
- Use the PID on the right on the command line with this command.
- Replace {yourEndpoint} with your webhook URL.
- Replace {yourChannel} with the channel from your asynchronous API.
- You must send the Data-Owner-Id in the header of the event to send the event to
  your Subscribers.
- You must send the partitionKey in the headers to send events in order, but you may
  exclude the partitionKey if the order doesn't matter.
- Fortellis does not send any more events with that partitionKey until the webhook
  sends a 202 Accepted response for an event.
- Fortellis uses the token to ensure your events are delivered in order.
- You must use port 9999 to find the program after completing the setup.
- Your src/main/resources/queue.json file keeps the original content.
- Heroku apps fall asleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Only use this deployment for demonstration purposes.
- Heroku lets the server sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- You must include your token in requests to your Heroku project URL.
- Event Relay is the Fortellis message broker in an event-driven architecture.
- Fortellis OAuth 2.0 authorization method is required for all API requests.
- You must have a Fortellis Sign in and be part of a verified organization to register
  an app.
- You can add or remove an API from the app anytime before you list the app in Marketplace.
- APIs can be rate limited and you can be charged with an overage, or denied service,
  for the usage over what is covered by the plan you selected.
- All amounts mentioned above are exclusive of all taxes and the taxes are calculated
  based on the area zip code.
- The authorization code flow is not secure in the context of JavaScript apps and
  single page apps.
- Keep in mind that the authorization code is valid for 60 seconds.
- Users must sign in to Fortellis a second time if they don't get a refresh token.
- API is private when initially registered, available only to organization members.
- You can use the same API key and secret for all API requests or you can configure
  Subscription-specific parameters for each API subscription.
- Fortellis uses OAuth 2.0 for access control.
- APIs are private by default and visible only to members of the organization.
- SOAP APIs are handled similarly to REST APIs.
- Use complete SOAP XML envelope in response payload.
- The Admin API works with the Fortellis Connection Callback API Specification to
  coordinate subscription activation and deactivation requests.
- Fortellis will always expect JSON (`application/json`) responses from your Admin
  API.
- Fortellis will always expect UTF-8 encoded responses from your Admin API.
- Use the Dev environment to test your API during the initial implementation phase.
- Use the Test environment when you are ready to offer the API to users outside your
  organization who want to test the API.
