notes:
- Order endpoints will only be accessible when using an API key associated with a
  courier-client type account.
- Standard Onfleet accounts cannot create orders directly at this time.
- The Order creation is a One-to-One relation, as in one pickup task and one dropoff
  task.
- It is recommended to validate address information prior to sending it to Onfleet.
- Onfleet utilizes Google's phone validation library for validating phone inputs.
- It is critical that your team has accurate address information to successfully perform
  pickups and deliveries.
- Onfleet requires a valid destination address or coordinate pair (longitude, latitude)
  in order to create a task.
- All requests must be authenticated using one of your organization’s API keys.
- A valid key must be provided with every request, where the key string is the username
  of the request, and the password is blank.
- You may not perform more than 20 requests per second across all of your organization's
  API keys.
- If possible, use webhooks instead of polling for state changes.
- When creating many tasks, use the batch endpoint if possible.
- If you exceed 20 req/s, you will first receive a `429` error.
- metadata is always a top-level array property on the entity where each member of
  the array represents a single metadata entry.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The number of metadata properties cannot exceed 32 per entity.
- Binary or binary-to-text encoded values are not allowed.
- Array nesting is not permitted.
- The object type must always include a value that is JSON-serializable.
- The length of the value field cannot exceed 1,024 characters.
- The number of metadata properties, that is, the length of the `metadata` array,
  cannot exceed **32 per entity**.
- Binary or binary-to-text encoded values, such as Base64, are not allowed. You should
  always provide external references should this type of data need to be associated
  with an entity.
- Array nesting is not permitted, therefore a metadata entry of type `array` cannot
  contain another array inside of it.
- The `object` type must always include a value that is JSON-serializable, as with
  all other objects in the API.
- The length of the `value` field, when stringified, cannot exceed 1,024 characters.
  If this is a problem, you should consider breaking up the data into separate metadata
  entries.
- You can add metadata to a new entity by providing it at creation.
- You can also add metadata to an existing entity by updating it directly.
- Complex types like object must match exactly to the fields in the entity for an
  entity to be included in the query result set.
- Complex types like object must match exactly to the fields in the entity, for an
  entity to be included in the query result set.
- Incidents will be automatically created and we will always communicate progress
  and relevant updates via our status page.
- It is a good practice to test against a non-production environment before you go
  live with your API integration.
- While we do not currently support environment-scoped API keys, we would be happy
  to get you set up with a separate organization for you to freely develop and test
  your integration without it affecting your production code or data.
- Scoped API Key offers users limited accessibility into an organization's API functions.
- This feature limits users with the Scoped API Key to create/manage Tasks and Webhook
  data related to aforementioned Tasks.
- Organizations represent the top-most entity on Onfleet.
- Administrators can perform actions via the dashboard.
- An organization can have up to one 'account owner' administrator.
- Workers (also known as drivers in the dashboard) are the members of an organization
  who perform actions via the Onfleet mobile applications.
- Onfleet has an internal system timeout of 70 seconds, which can be encountered when
  listing workers.
- Returns a paginated collection of all tasks currently assigned to a Worker given
  the Worker Id.
- Onfleet has an internal system timeout of 70 seconds, which can be encountered when
  listing tasks.
- Optional radius defaults to 1000 if missing. Maximum value is 10000.
- Note that it is not possible to programmatically update a worker's phone.
- It is not possible to programmatically update a worker's phone.
- Workers with an active task cannot be deleted until the task has been completed.
- Onfleet API only accepts time formatted in Unix to the millisecond precision.
- Google API key is optional based on your reporting requirements.
- The manifest will return 64 tasks direction at once.
- If the Route has more than 64 tasks, the response will include an 'lastId' field.
- This end point allows the user to quickly create hubs and assign them to the teams
  upon creation.
- Maximum distances among Drivers, Hubs, and Tasks is 200 miles.
- Only one Team Auto-dispatch operation can be active at any given time.
- Returns a paginated collection of all tasks currently in a Team given the Team Id
  that are not assigned to a worker.
- Destinations represent the location details for tasks, including exact coordinate
  and address information.
- Geocoding may slightly modify the format of the address properties.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Onfleet destination has built-in address validation by querying major geocoding
  services to ensure address is as close to the input as possible.
- The phone number field is used as a unique identifier in the Onfleet system.
- Finding a recipient requires an exact match for the target property provided.
- A Task can now be assigned to a route plan.
- Batch creation may encounter an internal system timeout of 70 seconds when uploading
  more than 25 tasks.
- Automatic assignment is not currently supported by this endpoint.
- Batch creation may encounter internal timeout when uploading more than 25 tasks.
- There is a limit of 500 tasks in the body per request for this endpoint.
- Limit of 500 tasks in the body per request for this endpoint.
- Custom Fields cannot be created nor updated from the API. All operations describe
  here is attached to the Task JSON Object as customFields.
- The Custom Value Key is case-sensitive and must be an exact match for the key as
  configured within the Dashboard.
- If the custom field has an empty value, omit the key-value pair object from the
  array to ensure the endpoint returns the correct results.
- Rate limits apply to API requests.
- Must have this setting checked on the dashboard in order for the Team field to be
  considered. Otherwise all available drivers will be considered.
- Must have this setting checked on the dashboard in order for the Team field to be
  considered.
- Tasks are assigned to their creator organization if the container property is missing.
- Signature, photo, and/or notes can be required on a per-task basis for task completion.
- Age Requirement feature is a Scale plan or higher feature. Please contact your Onfleet
  representatives or support for more information.
- When creating a new task, you may provide the IDs of existing tasks on which the
  newly-created task will depend by including them in the dependencies array.
- You will need to enable dependency management in the dashboard settings to use this
  functionality.
- Maintaining dependencies for existing tasks can be done in the same fashion as any
  other task property via the Update task endpoint.
- Phone numbers are considered unique identifiers for each recipient.
- If there are two recipients with the same phone number, the later records will overwrite
  the previous records.
- Recipient override allows for another name and phone number attached to the task
  for dispatch purposes.
- Using recipient override parameters will not update the recipient in the database.
- Returned tasks are always sorted by creation time.
- If the 502 error comes up, try narrowing your search parameters.
- For active tasks, only notes and metadata can be updated.
- Embedded updates are not currently supported.
- Only `notes` and `metadata` can be updated for active tasks.
- Only `metadata` and `customFields` can be updated for completed tasks.
- Active tasks can be force completed.
- Completed tasks cannot be updated in any way.
- The property `sourceTaskId` can be used to keep track of the source task from which
  the task was cloned.
- Active or completed tasks cannot be deleted.
- Existing tasks that are set to be executed by your organization may be automatically
  assigned in bulk to any available drivers.
- The auto assignment mode can be either 'distance' or 'load'.
- The 'teams' field is optional and restricts worker selection.
- All containers have a hard limit of 10,000 assigned tasks.
- Slow down concurrent requests to avoid contention and possible 412 PreconditionFailedError.
- If you see `412 PreconditionFailedError` responses, please slow down a bit and try
  to perform these operations serially.
- This replacement method is only supported on the worker container type.
- All time data fields returned are in milliseconds precision, with the exception
  of etaSeconds, which is in seconds.
- Onfleet offers a webhook developer tool in our open-source developer repository
- 'Timed out Timer: The request will time out in 10 seconds without a response.'
- Any timed out requests will be retried in 30 second intervals.
- The recommended pattern for processing our webhooks is to first respond to our request
  with an HTTP 200 response and then process the data afterwards, as the request will
  time out in 10 seconds without a response.
- After 300 consecutive failed requests the webhook will be disabled.
- Any failed requests will be retried in 30-minute cycles, up to one full day.
- If there are more than 300 consecutive failures, the webhook will be automatically
  disabled.
- Use Onfleet developer tools for webhook testing
- You may find a tool like ngrok useful to test your webhook integrations, however
  in order to pass the initial validation step, you will need to ensure that your
  tool of choice allows you to respond to our validation request, unless it has been
  automatically validated.
- If a webhook failed consecutively for 300 times or more, the isEnabled parameter
  will be turned to false.
- Webhook deletion requires the webhook ID.
- Some objects like Worker may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Various triggers for worker actions and route plans.
- Tasks that have warnings will be created, which may result in incorrect addresses.
- Barcode scanning requires Scale plan or higher, contact sales teams for more details.
- Use of scanOnlyRequiredBarcodes upon task creation to restrict the scanning of non-required
  barcodes.
- Use the boolean flag of scanOnlyRequiredBarcodes upon task creation to restrict
  the scanning of non-required barcodes.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When removing barcode requirements, remember to send in an empty array for the barcodes
  field instead of nil/NULL values.
- Barcodes can be only be captured via the Onfleet iOS or Android driver app.
- Capturing barcodes can be done for any task, regardless of barcode request status.
- Capturing barcodes can be done for any task, regardless of barcode request status,
  provided the organization has the feature enabled.
- Clients can access orders using their API key.
- Couriers can access orders on behalf of the clients using their own API key.
- You must include both the `pickupTask` and `dropoffTask` objects in order to complete
  this request.
- You will need the order IDs and not the individual Task IDs for updating the orders.
- Clients can cancel orders.
- Couriers can cancel orders on behalf of clients using their API key.
- Only Courier can reject orders from the clients.
- This endpoint should not be used for clients who are not configured with services.
- Creates a route plan that allows user to configure tasks in a grouped manner and
  schedule accordingly.
- A Route Plan can be updated at anytime.
- This endpoint enables task(s) addition. However, this endpoint will require you
  to keep a list of the tasks you already have in the route plan in addition to the
  task(s) you are to add.
- Each request will return an array of Route Plans; depending on the querying params.
- A Route Plan cannot be deleted if it is in progress, completed, or contains tasks.
- An Enterprise plan only endpoint
- The current restriction only disallows starting a new optimization if the user or
  API key has an in-progress Route Optimization.
- Route Start and Route End must have at least one field set; both cannot be empty.
- Requires the v3 Route Optimization Engine (available in Scale and Enterprise plans
  only).
- This endpoint will only respond with an HTTP 200 and no additional information.
- The user should use the id provided from the Schedule Route Optimization endpoint.
