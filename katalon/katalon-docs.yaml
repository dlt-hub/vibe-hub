notes:
- Rate limiting is a technique that restricts the number of API requests a client
  can make within a specified period.
- Sending a payload with the Get and Delete methods is not recommended.
- Login is UI action and consists of few steps.
- Common protocols include HTTP, REST, SOAP, JMS, and UDDI.
- Base url is https://reqres.in/api/users with ?page=2 as the query parameter.
- API testing verifies functionality, performance, security, and reliability.
- Common methods include API Keys, OAuth, JWT, and Basic Auth.
- As the services follow the idea of statelessness, it is not possible to maintain
  sessions.
- REST does not impose security restrictions inherently.
- REST services follow the concept of statelessness which essentially means no storing
  of any data across the requests on the server.
- One must remember that the greater the size of the payload, the larger would be
  the bandwidth consumption and time taken to process the request that can impact
  the server performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- APIs are crucial for ensuring software quality, efficiency, and security.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Chunked transfer encoding allows efficient transmission of large datasets.
errors:
- '409 Conflict: If versioning is maintained and an older version of the file is uploaded.'
- '204 No Content: Delete request returns 204 if no entity is included in the response.'
- '404 Not Found: Indicates that the URL is invalid or the resource is missing.'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '400: Missing name'
- 400 - BAD REQUEST - This can be due to validation errors or missing input data.
- 401 - UNAUTHORIZED - This is returned when there is no valid authentication credentials
  sent along with the request.
- 403 - FORBIDDEN - sent when the user does not have access (or is forbidden) to the
  resource.
- 404 - NOT FOUND - Resource method is not available.
- 500 - INTERNAL SERVER ERROR - server threw some exceptions while running the method.
- 502 - BAD GATEWAY - Server was not able to get the response from another upstream
  server.
- 400 - Bad Request – client-side error – failed input validation.
- 401 - Unauthorized – The user is not authenticated and hence does not have authority
  to access the resource.
- 403 - Forbidden – User is authenticated but is not authorized to access the resource.
- 404 - Not Found – The resource is not found.
- 500 - Internal server error – This is a very generic server-side error that is thrown
  when the server goes down.
- 502 - Bad Gateway – Server did not receive a valid response from the upstream server.
- 503 - Service Unavailable – Some unexpected things happened on the server such as
  system failure, overload, etc.
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '403 Forbidden: Check API key or OAuth credentials'
- '404 Not Found: Verify the resource path'
