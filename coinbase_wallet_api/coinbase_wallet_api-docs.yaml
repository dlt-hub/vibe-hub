auth_info:
- information_source; https://coinbase-prod.mintlify.app/api-reference/v2/authentication:
  - Bearer Tokens (JWTs) are required for server-to-server communication and must
    be included in the Authorization header. They are generated using your Secret
    API Key. Store your API key ID and Secret securely as environment variables rather
    than in code, and use the CDP SDK for automatic Bearer Token generation, or manually
    generate JWTs and export them as environment variables for REST API requests.
  - 'Client API Key authentication uses the API key as a URL path segment. Include
    the CLIENT_API_KEY (obtained from the API Keys dashboard and exported as an environment
    variable) in the URL path: https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/${CLIENT_API_KEY}.
    The Content-Type header must be set to application/json, and requests are made
    via HTTP POST with JSON-RPC formatted request bodies.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header with a JWT.
    For sensitive wallet write operations (POST, DELETE requests), an additional X-Wallet-Auth
    header is required, which contains a Wallet Token (JWT) generated from your Wallet
    Secret. The Wallet Secret is created in the Server Wallet dashboard and should
    be kept secure like a password. Both the JWT in the Authorization header and the
    Wallet Token in the X-Wallet-Auth header are used to authenticate requests, with
    the latter specifically for wallet write operations on EVM and Solana APIs.
  - Two authentication headers are required for wallet-authenticated endpoints. Include
    a Bearer token in the Authorization header and a Wallet Authentication JWT in
    the X-Wallet-Auth header. Environment variables JWT and WALLET_AUTH_JWT hold these
    token values respectively.
  - 'Use JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Generate a JWT with payload containing
    iat, nbf, jti, and uris fields, signed with the WALLET_SECRET environment variable.
    Include the token in requests via the Authorization header as a Bearer token.


    Environment variables required: WALLET_SECRET, REQUEST_METHOD, REQUEST_HOST, REQUEST_PATH,
    REQUEST_BODY. The JWT payload must include issued-at time (iat), not-before time
    (nbf), unique JWT ID (jti), and request URIs (uris). For requests with bodies,
    include a sorted JSON hash of the request body in the payload.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://coinbase-prod.mintlify.app/api-reference/rest-api/addresses/list-address-balances:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination for listing address balances. Request parameters
    include an optional page query parameter (passed as next_page from the previous
    response). The response includes has_more boolean to indicate if more results
    exist, next_page string for the subsequent request, and total_count for the total
    number of results.
  - The endpoint uses cursor-based pagination with a page query parameter (max 5000
    characters). The response includes has_more boolean, next_page cursor string for
    subsequent requests, and total_count. Pass the next_page value as the page parameter
    in the next request to retrieve more results; stop when has_more is false.
