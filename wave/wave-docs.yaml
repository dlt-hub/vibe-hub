  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" when making POST requests to the
    GraphQL endpoint.

  - OAuth2 token refresh flow is used to obtain a new access_token when the current
    one expires. POST to https://api.waveapps.com/oauth2/token/ with Content-Type
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded and include required parameters client_id, client_secret,
    refresh_token, grant_type set to refresh_token, and redirect_uri. The response
    contains a new access_token in the same format as the initial token response.
    Note that a 403 Forbidden error occurs if the associated business subscription
    is no longer active.
  - Wave API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Redirect users to https://api.waveapps.com/oauth2/authorize/
    with GET parameters client_id, response_type set to "code", scope (space-delimited),
    and optional redirect_uri and state. After user authorization, Wave redirects
    to your redirect_uri with authorization code in the code query parameter (valid
    for 10 minutes, single use) and the state value you provided. Exchange the code
    for tokens by POSTing to https://api.waveapps.com/oauth2/token/ with Content-Type
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded and parameters client_id and client_secret.
  - Wave uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Exchange authorization code for access
    token by POSTing client_id, client_secret, code, grant_type set to "authorization_code",
    and redirect_uri to the token endpoint, receiving access_token, refresh_token,
    expires_in, token_type, and scope. Include the access_token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" when making API requests to https://gql.waveapps.com/graphql/public.
  - Wave uses OAuth2 for authentication. Access tokens can be refreshed, but will
    fail with a 403 error if the business subscription is inactive. Redirect URIs
    must exactly match whitelisted entries (host, port, and path as subdirectory).
    To revoke tokens, POST to https://api.waveapps.com/oauth2/token-revoke/ with client_id,
    client_secret, and token as application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters. Multiple
    authorizations are supported, and the approval_prompt=force GET parameter forces
    re-authorization to access different businesses or upgrade scopes.
