auth_info:
- information_source; https://voodoorobotics.com/orders-api/:
  - All API requests require authentication headers. Include them in a headers dictionary
    as token auth, session cookies, or oauth. Exact header names and values depend
    on your specific authentication configuration and should be set based on your
    system's auth scheme.
- information_source; https://voodoorobotics.com/pick-light-integration/:
  - Authentication uses username and password credentials sent via POST request to
    a login endpoint, which returns a token that is then used for subsequent API calls.
    The login endpoint is at "https://www.voodoodevices.com/api/user/login/" and accepts
    form-encoded data with fields "username" and "password". The response contains
    a token that should be extracted and used in subsequent requests.
  - The API uses username/password credentials sent as form data to a login endpoint
    at user/login/. The login response contains a JSON token field. This token must
    then be included in subsequent requests via the x-csrf-token header, along with
    a referer header set to the base API URL.
  - The API uses username/password credentials submitted as form-encoded data to a
    login endpoint, which returns a JSON response containing a token field. The extracted
    token is then sent in the x-csrf-token header along with a referer header set
    to the base URL for subsequent authenticated requests.
- information_source; https://voodoorobotics.com/rest-api/:
  - API key authentication is required via the 'API-KEY' header. Include your API
    key in the headers dictionary with the key 'API-KEY' set to your API key value,
    and set 'Content-Type' to 'application/json'. Pass these headers in all requests
    to the API endpoint.
