- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You're permitted to use these web apps and APIs for free with the Free Edition in
  non-production environments.
- This version of Camunda 8 is no longer actively maintained.
- A core value of Camunda 8 lies in the combination of automation and human interaction.
- Uses REST Connector to get a random cat fact from the Cat Fact API
- Zeebe must show a status of Healthy to properly deploy your model in future guide
  steps.
- Requires setup of SendGrid account to obtain API key.
- The initial release of Camunda Forms includes a debut minimal feature set, which
  will be expanded with upcoming versions.
- If using with Camunda 7, note that the Camunda Forms feature was added with the
  4.7.0 release of Desktop Modeler.
- Optimize requires no additional set up. You can immediately obtain process insights
  as Optimize already continuously collects data for analysis.
- Message correlation is a feature in Camunda 8 that allows targeting a running workflow
  with state updates from external systems.
- 'End of maintenance: 10th of April 2024'
- Do not update to Camunda 8.1.23
- Camunda 8.0.15 release is skipped
- If you are not running Tasklist or Operate, there is currently no way to retrieve
  usage metrics until future releases.
- There is no active load balancing across partitions.
- Leader election for any partition is autonomous and independent of leader elections
  for other partitions.
- Choosing the number of partitions depends on the use case, workload, and cluster
  setup.
- For testing and early development, start with a single partition.
- With a single Zeebe broker, a single partition is usually enough.
- Base your decisions on data. Simulate the expected workload, measure, and compare
  the performance of different partition setups.
- Manual rebalancing is done on a best-effort basis.
- Rebalancing request is successfully completed by the gateway, but leaders will ignore
  the request and no re-election is triggered if not supported.
- Free Trial clusters have the same functionality as a production cluster, but are
  size small and only available during your trial period.
- Development clusters are recommended for development, testing, proof of concepts,
  and demos.
- Clients may not get a response in case of connection timeout, network connection
  loss, failover, or gateway failure.
- Long polling is supported for job requests to better utilize resources.
- Incidents represent a problem in process execution.
- Incidents are created when a job fails and has no retries left.
- The compensation event is supported in Camunda 7, but not yet in Camunda 8.
- Incidents are created in different situations including job failures and variable
  mapping issues.
- It is recommended to complete operations in Operate.
- Use the process instance modification only in exceptional cases to repair the process
  instance. It is not recommended using it as a part of the regular flow of the process;
  find additional details here.
- The compensation event is supported in Camunda 7, but not yet in Camunda 8. It is
  on the roadmap and will eventually be available in Camunda 8.
- The process instance can't terminate the last active element instance of a child
  process instance. As a result, the process instance doesn't apply the termination
  instruction and rejects the command.
- Exporter-specific configuration is handled through the exporter's [exporters.args]
  nested map.
- Zeebe creates a single isolated class loader for every JAR referenced by exporter
  configurations.
- Different exporters can depend on the same third-party libraries without worrying
  about versions or class name collisions.
- Zeebe only guarantees at-least-once semantics.
- To reduce the amount of duplicate records an exporter processes, the stream processor
  keeps track of the position of the last successfully exported record for every single
  exporter.
- Export operations should be idempotent.
- Exporters should not perform any computationally heavy work during instantiation/configuration.
- It is necessary that export operations be idempotent.
- If you implement Camunda 8 with Elasticsearch as a service provider, you must configure
  Elasticsearch with the following privileges in mind.
- Requests and responses are in JSON notation.
- Some objects have additional endpoints.
- Access tokens have a validity period found in the access token.
- After client credentials are created, the Client Secret is only shown once.
- The auth service has built-in rate limiting.

- Can't activate the element if the subprocess has more than one active instance.

- The process instance can't terminate the last active element instance of a child
  process instance.
- The process instance can't apply the modification instructions and rejects the modification
  command.
- If an error occurs during the Exporter#open(Context) phase, the stream processor
  fails and is restarted.
- If an error occurs during the Exporter#close phase, it is logged, but will still
  allow other exporters to gracefully finish their work.
- If an error occurs during processing, we continuously retry the same record until
  no error is produced.
