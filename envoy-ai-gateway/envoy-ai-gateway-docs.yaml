notes:
- This allows the ai-gateway to understand the input and perform the necessary transformation
  depending on the API schema pair (input, output).
- Note that this is vendor specific, and the stability of the API schema is not guaranteed
  by the ai-gateway, but by the vendor via proper versioning.
- The Envoy AI Gateway addresses the growing demand for secure, scalable, and efficient
  AI/LLM traffic management.
- Complete integration with Gateway API Inference Extension v0.5.1, enabling intelligent
  endpoint selection based on real-time AI inference metrics like KV-cache usage,
  queue depth, and LoRA adapter information.
- Support for both HTTPRoute + InferencePool and AIGatewayRoute + InferencePool integration
  patterns, providing flexibility for different use cases from simple to advanced
  AI routing scenarios.
- The switch to sidecar + UDS model may require configuration updates for existing
  deployments.
- Routing to Kubernetes services is not supported in Envoy AI Gateway v0.2.0.
- Upstream Authentication secures the connectivity between the Gateway and the LLM
  Providers.
- It allows AI platform teams to handle the secure storage and management of credentials
  and use them in one place.
