auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hardcover.app/api/getting-started/:
  - Authentication uses an API token obtained from the account settings page at https://hardcover.app/account/api.
    The token must be sent as a header named `authorization` with the token value
    in each request to the GraphQL endpoint at https://api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql.
    Tokens are private credentials and should not be shared.
- information_source; https://docs.hardcover.app/api/getting-started:
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Obtain your API token from your account
    settings page at https://hardcover.app/account/api, then include it in the `authorization`
    header for all requests to the GraphQL endpoint at https://api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql.
    Keep tokens private as they grant full account access.

  - 'Authorization Token


    This API requires an Authorization Token to authenticate requests. The token should
    be sent in the Authorization header when making GraphQL queries. Replace ##USER_ID##
    with your account id obtained from the Getting Started guide. The token authenticates
    requests against your account, and you are responsible for the content of queries
    run on your account.'
- information_source; https://docs.hardcover.app/api/guides/gettingbookswithstatus/:
  - 'Authorization is required to query user books. An authorization token must be
    provided, and queries will execute against the authenticated user''s account.
    The documentation specifies replacing ##USER_ID## with your account id (obtainable
    from the Getting Started guide) and notes that you are responsible for the content
    of queries run on your account, but does not explicitly specify the header name,
    parameter name, or format for submitting the authorization token.'

  - Authorization Token is required to run queries against your account. Send the
    token in the Authorization header when making GraphQL requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hardcover.app/api/guides/gettingallbooksinlibrary/:
  - Use limit and offset parameters to paginate through user books. The limit parameter
    (default 5 in example) specifies how many results to return per page, and offset
    specifies the starting position. Increment offset by the limit value to fetch
    subsequent pages.
