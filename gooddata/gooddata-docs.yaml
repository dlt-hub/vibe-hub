auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gooddata.com/docs/cloud/api-and-sdk/api/api_reference_all/:
  - API tokens are created via POST request to /api/v1/entities/users/{userId}/apiTokens
    and returned with a bearerToken attribute in the response. The bearer token should
    be used in subsequent requests, typically in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}".
  - Authentication type for data sources is specified via the "authenticationType"
    field set to "USERNAME_PASSWORD", with credentials provided through "clientId"
    and "clientSecret" fields in the data source configuration object.
  - Client-based authentication for data sources is supported through multiple mechanisms
    sent in the request body. The authentication fields include username and password
    for basic database authentication, clientId and clientSecret for OAuth2 or similar
    client credential flows, token for token-based authentication, and privateKey
    with optional privateKeyPassphrase for key-pair authentication. All credentials
    are passed as string fields in the JSON request payload to the test endpoint.
  - OAuth2 and SAML authentication configuration is supported. OAuth2 requires oauthClientId,
    oauthClientSecret, oauthIssuerId, and oauthIssuerLocation parameters in the request
    body. SAML authentication uses samlMetadata parameter. Additional OAuth2 options
    include oauthCustomScopes (array of scope strings), oauthCustomAuthAttributes
    (custom attributes object), and oauthSubjectIdClaim (claim name for subject ID,
    default "oid"). Custom claim mapping is available via customClaimMapping parameter.
  - 'OAuth2 configuration is required for identity provider setup. Credentials are
    passed in the request body as JSON fields: oauthClientId, oauthClientSecret, oauthIssuerId,
    and oauthIssuerLocation. Additional OAuth parameters include oauthCustomScopes
    (array), oauthSubjectIdClaim, and oauthCustomAuthAttributes (object). SAML configuration
    via samlMetadata is also supported as an alternative auth method.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.gooddata.com/docs/cloud/api-and-sdk/api/api_reference_all/:
  - 'Pagination is controlled by query parameters: page (zero-based index, default
    0) and size (page size, default 20). The response includes data array with paginated
    results; continue requesting with incremented page values until fewer than size
    results are returned.'
  - Pagination is controlled via query parameters page[number] and page[size], with
    response metadata in meta.page containing number, size, totalElements, and totalPages.
    The links object provides a next URL for subsequent pages; stop paginating when
    next is absent or all totalElements are retrieved.
  - Pagination is implemented using query parameters page (zero-based index, default
    0) and size (page size, default 20). The response includes a data array containing
    the paginated results. Continue paginating by incrementing the page parameter
    until fewer than size results are returned.
  - Pagination is supported via offset and limit query parameters. offset (integer,
    optional) specifies the starting position, and limit (integer, optional) specifies
    the maximum number of items to return per request. The response does not include
    explicit pagination state fields; continue requesting with incremented offset
    values until fewer items than limit are returned.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters in the response: page.number (current
    page starting at 0), page.size (items per page), page.totalElements (total items),
    page.totalPages (total pages in meta object), and links.next (URL for next page).
    Construct subsequent requests using the next link or increment page.number until
    it reaches totalPages.'
