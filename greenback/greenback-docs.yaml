auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.greenback.com/:
  - 'All requests to the Greenback API require an access token (API key) sent as an
    HTTP Authorization header with Bearer scheme. Include the token in the header
    as "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" where {access_token} is your unique
    API key obtained from Greenback. API keys are organization-specific and should
    be kept secure.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" when making requests to the API.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where {token} is your API credential
    provided by the service.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where {token} is your API key.'
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" where {token} is your API key (e.g., "Bearer 1234567890").
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.greenback.com/:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with optional limit parameter (defaults to 100)
    controlling page size. Use the cursor value from the response to request the next
    page; see the Pagination section for details on how to construct subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with limit and cursor query parameters.
    The limit parameter controls page size (default and max values not specified in
    excerpt), and cursor from the response is used to fetch the next page of results.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination for listing transactions. Request parameters
    include a cursor passed via query string (construct next request using the "next"
    value from response). The response contains a "pagination" object with "count"
    (items in current page), "total_count" (total items available), and "next" (cursor
    for next page); stop paginating when "next" is absent.
  - The List Connects endpoint uses pagination with count and total_count fields in
    a pagination object within the response. The count field indicates the number
    of items returned in the current response, while total_count indicates the total
    number of connects available. No explicit page parameters or navigation fields
    like next or cursor are shown in the provided documentation.
  - 'Use cursor-based pagination with optional limit parameter. Request parameters:
    limit (integer, optional, defaults to 100) and cursor (string, optional, defaults
    to first page). Response returns paginated Account objects; use the cursor value
    from response for subsequent requests to fetch next page.'
