auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/1000.824.0/:
  - JIRA Cloud REST API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication when integrating
    via Atlassian Connect add-ons. The add-on exchanges a security context with the
    application to create and validate JWT tokens that are embedded in API calls.
    For details on implementation, refer to the Atlassian Connect authentication documentation.
  - JWT tokens embedded in API calls for Atlassian Connect authentication. For direct
    REST API integration, use OAuth 1.0a (recommended, token-based) or Basic HTTP
    authentication (username and password, less secure). Browser-based requests can
    use cookie-based authentication established by JIRA login. The `/auth/1/session`
    resource supports POST for session management.
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/:
  - 'Basic authentication is used for ad-hoc API calls. Send HTTP Basic Auth credentials
    (username and password encoded in Base64) in the Authorization header with the
    format "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>". Operations require
    specific permissions granted through groups, project roles, issue roles, or directly
    to users; common permissions include site administration, Jira administration,
    and project administration.'
  - Jira Cloud REST API supports three authentication approaches depending on app
    type. Forge apps use OAuth 2.0 scopes for REST API calls to /rest/api/3/<resource-name>.
    Connect apps use JWT-based authentication built into Connect libraries with authorization
    via scopes or user impersonation, calling https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>.
    Other integrations use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) with scopes,
    calling https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>.
    Specific scope requirements are indicated per operation as "App scope required"
    or "OAuth scopes required".
  - Jira Cloud REST API v3 uses OAuth2-based authentication for Forge apps. Credentials
    are managed through REST API scopes defined in your app configuration. For Forge
    apps, authentication is handled automatically by the Jira platform; you do not
    manually pass credentials in requests. Specific scope requirements depend on which
    API endpoints your app accesses.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/:
  - startAt and maxResults are query parameters for pagination, where startAt is the
    index of the first item (default 0) and maxResults is the maximum items per page
    with operation-specific limits. Responses include total (total item count across
    all pages, may change) and isLast (boolean indicating if current page is last),
    though these fields are not returned for all operations. Stop paginating when
    isLast is true or when the returned page is empty.
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/1000.1000.0/:
  - JIRA uses offset-based pagination with startAt and maxResults query parameters.
    The response includes startAt (current offset), maxResults (items per page), total
    (total count, may change or be omitted), and values (result array). Clients construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing startAt by maxResults; each API may have different
    limits on maxResults.
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/1000.1001.0/:
  - JIRA uses offset-based pagination with startAt (default 0, indicates first item
    position) and maxResults (controls results per page, API-specific limits) query
    parameters. Responses return a JSON object containing startAt, maxResults, total
    (total entities across all pages, may change or be omitted), and values array
    with results. Clients construct subsequent requests by incrementing startAt; stop
    when the values array is empty or startAt exceeds total.
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/1000.1003.0/:
  - JIRA uses offset-based pagination with startAt and maxResults query parameters.
    Responses include startAt, maxResults, total, and values array. startAt indicates
    the first item position, maxResults controls results per page (API-specific limits
    apply), and total shows total entities across all pages but may change between
    requests. Clients should paginate by incrementing startAt until the page is empty.
- information_source; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/1000.1005.0/:
  - JIRA uses offset-based pagination with startAt and maxResults query parameters.
    The response includes startAt (starting item index), maxResults (items per page),
    total (total count across all pages, may change and is optional), and values (array
    of results). Clients construct subsequent requests by incrementing startAt by
    maxResults to fetch the next page; stop when the values array is empty or startAt
    exceeds total.
