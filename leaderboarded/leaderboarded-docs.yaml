  - Each board has its own unique access token that must be included in the URL path
    of all API requests. The token is found in the board's control panel under the
    Share > Embed on a Website section and is used as {your_token} in the API endpoint
    URL format GET https://leaderboarded.com/api/{your_token}/board/. The token provides
    access to both read and write operations for that specific board.
