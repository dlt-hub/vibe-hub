auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.api.jobprogress.com/:
  - Access tokens are required to authenticate with the Leap API. Generate a token
    from your account's Settings > Developer page (admin users only), then pass it
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with each request.
  - This version of the API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. All requests must be sent
    via HTTPS and require an access token, which can be generated from the Leap dashboard.
    The access token should be included in requests to authenticate with the API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.api.jobprogress.com/:
  - Use the `limit` query parameter to control the number of items returned per request,
    with a default of 10 and maximum of 100 items. The documentation does not specify
    response fields or mechanisms for navigating between pages.
