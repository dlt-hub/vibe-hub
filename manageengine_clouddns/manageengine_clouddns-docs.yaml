  - 'Authorization header with a custom auth token. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: My Auth-token" where the token value is your API authentication
    credential for the ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus API.'
- information_source; https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/desktop-central-powershell-authentication:
  - The API uses basic authentication with query parameters. Send a GET request to
    the authentication endpoint with username and password (base64-encoded) as query
    parameters, and auth_type set to local_authentication. The response returns an
    auth_token that is used for subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/login-through-api:
  - Authentication requires sending username and password as HTTP query parameters
    to the auth endpoint, which returns an authtoken and permissions list. The endpoint
    format is /sdpapi/auth?username=<username>&password=<password>, and the returned
    authtoken should be used in subsequent requests.

    with form data containing client_id, client_secret, and grant_type set to client_credentials.
