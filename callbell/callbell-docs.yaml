notes:
- Ensure the recipient phone number has opted in and is within the 24-hour window
  allowed by the WhatsApp Business API.
- It’s necessary to specify an access token for every requests sent to the API
- Our API will start rejecting HTTP requests by returning 429 Too Many Requests in
  case that the RPS (Requests per Seconds) exceeds the limit of 300 RPS.
- You can use the same steps to update a contact when a user changes their profile.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Callbell
errors:
- '429 Too Many Requests: Exceeds the limit of 300 RPS'
- Responses in the 2xx range means that the request has been executed successfully
- Responses in the 4xx range means that the request has been not successful because
  of a client error like authentication, rate limit reached or wrong params
- Responses in the 5xx range means that the request hasn’t been successful because
  of an internal server error. It’s usually safe to retry those requests with a delay
  or at a later time
