auth_info:
- information_source; https://voipstudio.com/docs/administrator/integrations/webhooks/:
  - Authentication appending TOKEN parameter on query URL is supported. This means
    you can append a token as a query parameter to your webhook URL for authentication
    purposes, such as `https://your-url.com/webhook?token=YOUR_TOKEN`.
- information_source; https://voipstudio.com/docs/api/introduction/:
  - API requests require the X-Auth-Token header containing a user_token (API Key)
    obtained from a successful POST /login or POST /apitokens response. Include the
    token in the X-Auth-Token header for all authenticated requests.
  - Login credentials (email and password) are sent in the JSON request body to POST
    /v1.2/voipstudio/login, which returns a user_token that expires after 30 minutes
    of inactivity. The user_token is passed in the X-Auth-Token header for subsequent
    API requests. Longer-lived API tokens can be created via POST /apitokens using
    the user_token, specifying a name and expiry duration in seconds.
  - VoIPstudio API requires an API Key (user_token) for authorization. Obtain it either
    by sending a POST request to the /login endpoint with email and password credentials,
    or generate it via the VoIPstudio Web Dashboard. The user_token is then used to
    authorize all subsequent API requests.
- information_source; https://voipstudio.com/docs/api/resources/auth/:
  - API user token authentication is required. POST to /login with email and password
    in JSON body to obtain a token that expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. Include
    the token in the Authorization header (Basic auth scheme) for all API requests.
    Use GET /ping periodically to keep the token valid. Optional parameters include
    remember_me and device_fingerprint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://voipstudio.com/docs/api/introduction/:
  - For collection endpoints, use query parameters page (page number) and limit (records
    per page, maximum 5000) to paginate. Successful GET collection responses include
    data array and total field indicating total resource count.
