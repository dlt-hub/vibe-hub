notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- In lab and test environments, Basic Authentication over HTTPS is possible.
- Token based authentication requires a Token obtained via an external IdP.
- Nomad architecture is designed for efficient content distribution.
- Requires setup of connected app in Tachyon
- OAuth2 with refresh token requires setup of connected app in API
- Ensure proper authentication headers are included in all requests.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Handling errors returned by Tachyon
- 1E Client 23.11 and later will not install on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in 1E
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Some objects like Device may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires OAuth2 authentication with a connected app setup.
- Some experience metrics may not be available for certain devices
- Requires authentication via OAuth2.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for API access.
- Ensure to handle rate limits appropriately.
- Issue an instruction, track its progress and retrieve responses
- Ensure proper authentication setup for API access.
- This documentation refers to the Tachyon Agent, which is an old name for 1E Client.
- The NomadContent Distribution client module has some methods available for use in
  DEXCode.
- Some objects like Client Activity Record may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- VDX captures information from your Citrix virtualization infrastructure to provide
  monitoring and session experience scoring to speed up troubleshooting and help with
  root cause analysis.
- Known issues related to Nomad behavior in a simple environment
- Requires OAuth2 setup in the 1E portal
- Data may vary based on user permissions
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Ensure to follow the API testing tools for effective integration.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required for access
- API requires authentication setup.
- Known issues may affect integration or data quality
- Ensure all configurations are according to the latest standards
- API supports various operations for device management and event handling.
- Some objects like user engagement may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API provides various endpoints for interacting with devices and policies.
- Known issues may affect integration or data quality.
- Some endpoints may return limited data based on user permissions
- Tachyon deliberately does not work with self-signed certificates for security reasons.
- Earlier versions of Tachyon required the certificate to have a CN and used SAN fields
  differently.
- Option 2 type certificates required the CN to be the computername FQDN, and the
  list of Subject Alternate Names (SAN) to contain the DNS Alias.
- Option 1 type certificates required the CN to be the DNS Alias, and the list of
  Subject Alternate Names (SAN) to contain the computername FQDN.
- Tachyon 5.0 and later is able to use this type of certificate when upgrading from
  an earlier version of Tachyon.
- The certificate for the Root CA in the Certification Path must exist in the Trusted
  Root CA store of the client.
- Most organizations have automated distribution of these CA certificates to clients
  and servers, using Group Policy for example.
- Integrates with Tachyon API for various device and network operations.
- Requires OAuth2 tokens for authentication.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup
- Rate limits may apply
- The license must be activated. Once activated, it may be used only by the system
  that activated it.
- Licenses can be renewed or updated, but if allowed to expire, then the affected
  products or features will not be usable.
- Requires configuration of OAuth2 authentication for API access.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Tachyon
- Requires OAuth2 setup to access device and activity records
- Microsoft SQL Server Express is not supported for either Master or Responses databases,
  due to its limitations.
- There is no requirement to backup the Tachyon Responses database because it only
  contains transient data.
- You can backup and restore the Responses database if that is your organization's
  preference for recovery.
- There are no requirements to backup the ActiveEfficiency database, which you can
  delete.
- Make sure to set the correct client credentials in your environment.
- Uses Tachyon Setup for installation, upgrade, and patching in Failover Cluster Instance
  and AlwaysOn Availability Group.
- Web-Http-Redirect is only required to support legacy Nomad clients after an In-place
  upgrade of ActiveEfficiency Server for Nomad.
- Web-Basic-Auth is only required if you will be installing 1E ITSM Connect or 1E
  Core for integrating ServiceNow and Tachyon.
- OAuth2 is required for authentication
- All communication is encrypted, which requires a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
- Each server that has Tachyon Server components installed requires its own Web Server
  certificate.
- Tachyon web server deliberately does not work with self-signed certificates for
  security reasons.
- Each server that has Tachyon server components installed requires its own Web Server
  certificate.
- 'The Web Server certificate requires the minimum of the following: Issued by a trusted
  Certificate Authority (CA), Has at least the following Key Usage: Digital signature,
  Key encipherment, Has at least the following Enhanced Key Usages: Server Authentication,
  Revocation information is included.'

  the first time after a new installation of a Tachyon Server.
- Users do not receive emails about approvals or response expiry if the SMTP Email
  has been disabled or SMTP details in Tachyon.Coordinator.exe.config are incorrect
  or missing.
- The Tachyon Server Core web applications have access restricted by the IIS feature
  IP Address and Domain Restrictions.
- If the action was submitted by a user who has permissions to All devices or a parent
  level management group e.g. 'UK Servers' (to the approver's associated child management
  group 'UK Desktops') and the instruction was targeted to the approver's accessible
  management group 'UK Desktops', then the approver will not have access to approve
  it. This is due to the workflow looking at the user's permission and not the scope
  of the target devices which could potentially include devices that another user
  is not allowed to view or approve.
- While trying to create a Daily Instruction Schedule in the Instruction scheduler
  popup on clicking Save you are prompted to enter a value in the Repeat Every Hour
  field. If the field is left blank the text Must be a number is displayed. If you
  try to enter a number but set it to 0 the validation error Must be between 1 and
  23 is displayed. The field is not actually mandatory but the validation will not
  allow the schedule to be created unless a value has been set.
- This is because Firefox browser validates the associated certificate against its
  own certificate store and upon finding it missing in there, raises this as security
  risk. Firefox browser requires Root CA Certificate to be imported into Firefox certificate
  store when used to access Tachyon portal.
- When using Firefox browser, the Explorer page may not get rendered properly and
  displays some content as blank areas. This has been seen most often with Firefox
  version 61.
- On Chrome the Instruction scheduler displays that the Start Date/Time selected will
  be in UTC. However, on other browsers (e.g. Firefox and Microsoft Edge) the UTC
  text is missing and it may appear that the Date/Time selected is the current local
  time even though it uses UTC.
- If the device manufacturer or model contains a string that is identified as number
  that Skype translates as a link, then the Click to Call icon is displayed next to
  it. This could be seen when clicking on the information icon next to any Tachyon
  client devices in the Explorer > Devices > Table or Response pages.
- When using Edge browser and attempting to submit an instruction which requires parameter
  inputs and it displays tip text, this text remains and is not over written. The
  light grey tip text is only displayed in the Explorer page of the Edge browser and
  does not get submitted as part of the instruction so it can be ignored.
- Scheduled instruction workflow is not displaying the appropriate warnings when multiple
  users have updated a scheduled instruction or when there are multiple updates on
  one that is pending approval or waiting for the authentication code to be applied.
- TachyonMaster Switch table may contain multiple entries if the IP address of the
  server running the Switch Host service has changed and this will cause the sent
  count to go up for any instruction submitted.

  method returns an incomplete process list since an Android applications are now
  sandboxed to enhanced security by application isolation.
- Post clean install of Tachyon server, when user logs in for the first time to Explorer,
  the Explorer lands on error page complaining about lack of permissions.
- If the specified filename uses non-ascii characters, the FileSystem module may not
  be able to find the file and therefore it will not be able to retrieve further information
  about it and report it's size as -1 and that the hash is 'invalid hash'.
- This can happen when an extra space exists in the search string or in responses.
- If a client on a laptop has been processing instructions and the WiFi connection
  is lost, it does not recognise the connection is no longer available and continues
  to send responses.
- This can occur if the SQL instance and the TachyonResponses database are unreachable.
- If the client is restarted whilst it's attempting to download a resource script,
  it logs ERROR - [Seq=<id>] Error processing instruction (InstructionId=<id>) On
  restart the client will not re-process the instruction so the error is not sent
  up to the server.
- If the client service is terminated abruptly while processing an instruction, the
  client will re-request the instruction when it next starts up. This causes the Switch
  to re-send the same instruction to the client, which in turn will cause the statistics
  to show an increased Sent Count.
- If the client is in the middle of an upload at the point that the instruction is
  cancelled, the Switch will cancel the upload if the size of the response exceeds
  4K.
- When the Coordinator service goes into faulted state (e.g. as the result of an internal

  Management Center to track which subnet the client device is on when it powers down.
  The WakeUp module reports back subnet changes more frequently than the NightWatchman
  Agent.
- WakeUp Server must be installed before installation of the WakeUp client. If WakeUp
  client is installed first the WakeUp Server installer only provides the WakeUp Administration
  console installation option.
- When installing on a WakeUp Server, do not enable HTTP or HTTPS reporting, because

- Some endpoints may require additional permissions.
- Requires connected app setup in Tachyon.
- The account used to run the Tachyon.ProductPackDeploymentTool.exe must have local
  administrator rights on the computer it is running on
- You would not normally perform a cleanup on a production server. This option is
  intended mainly for use in lab environments where you want to delete and re-upload
  the content in order to test different Product Packs.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Nomad
- Explorer prompts for credentials based on browser security settings.

- Full Administrator role is required for managing Device tags.
- Supports various built-in functions and commands.
- Exporting responses can be done in CSV or TSV format depending on the method chosen.
- Quarantine is available only on Windows, but not available on Windows XP.
- Quarantine requires that at least one switch URI and one background channel URI
  each resolve to IPv4 addresses.
- Quarantine will only work if a device's connection to the switch is over IPv4.
- The CRLChecks setting in the 1E Client configuration file should be set to soft.
- Quarantine will persist until the Release selected devices from quarantine instruction
  is received.
- If a Tachyon client cannot be connect to the Tachyon Server, it will not be possible
  to issue this command.
- Any changes to the routing tables, IPv6 bindings or the hosts file made during quarantine
  will be reverted when the Release selected devices from quarantine instruction is
  received.
- If the persistent storage of the client is deleted or modified by anything other
  than Tachyon whilst in quarantine, the client will not be able to release the device
  from quarantine properly.
- Upgrading, uninstalling, installing or modifying the client installation during
  quarantine is not supported.
- After a release from quarantine the IPv4 loopback address will not be resolvable.
- Quarantining a device will also stop it from being able to see Domain Controllers.
- Requires setup of connected app in Tachyon platform.
- This API requires authentication.
- API requires authentication for access.
- Various endpoints available for device and network information.
- Some installers do not support the LOGPATH property and the logs folder is not configurable
  during installation.
- Some objects may return incomplete data
- Some API responses may include nested data structures
- Some metrics may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Handling errors returned by Tachyon may require specific error handling strategies.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 connected application.
- Please ensure you complete all verification tests. They not only confirm your system
  is operational, but they also introduce you to concepts and tasks that you will
  use later when using Tachyon.
- 'To run these tests, you need: Tachyon Server installed with Tachyon Experience
  configured, At least one test device on which the 1E Client has been installed,
  The Tachyon platform has already been verified following the Verifying page which
  requires a Tachyon User with various administration rights, Access to the SQL Server
  database instance and SQL Server Analysis Services instance to check the Experience
  database, To complete the test below requires a Tachyon User assigned to Experience
  Administrators role.'
- Integration may require additional setup for specific features
- Survey description is limited to 512 characters.
- It's good practice to test the survey on a few machines first before deploying to
  All Devices.
- The Assign Mgmt Grp button can be used to limit the survey's targeted devices to
  a specific Management Group.
- Refer to the API documentation for detailed integration guidance.
- Requires OAuth2 setup
- Check API limits for data extraction
- Some data may be subject to API call limits
- Some objects like User may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Announcements are only sent out once
- New engagements are not enabled by default
- Investigating Boot and Login Performance
- Before saving the dashboard you may want to choose which metrics to show in your
  custom Preset view.
- The way you choose metrics differs depending on the page you're customizing.
- Some objects like activity_record may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Refer to 1E platform - Known issues for other applications.
- Try searching the 1E Support Portal for issues that have hotfixes.
- Ensure proper scope is set for data access.
- Use OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires OAuth2 authentication
- Requires setup of API credentials in Tachyon portal
- Only the current gradings can be seen here, there is no ability to look at the history
  information in this panel.
- Some objects like ActivityRecord may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- User Engagement requires deployment to apply changes.
- API testing tools available for integration
- Some devices may not return complete information.
- Requires authentication setup in Tachyon.
- Data may not be available if not properly authenticated.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required for API access.
- To use Dashboards, you must have a suitable license included as a consumer in your
  platform license, which you can obtain from your 1E Account Team.
- You do not need the license to install the app, but you do need the license to see
  the app in the Tachyon portal and in the Switch app menu.
- Some devices may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ensure you complete all verification tests.
- To run these tests, you need a valid license that includes Dashboards.
