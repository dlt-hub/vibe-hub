notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is supported.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- A field that relies upon a constantly increasing tag value. When a production record
  is captured, you do not want the actual value for the tag but the difference between
  the current value of the tag and the value of the last created record for the tag.
- Auxiliary Control Network, a second network that is not part of the control network.
- Once an OTS Activity is started, the Initial Timeout is extended relative to the
  defined duration of the Activity.
- A one-off material movement that is created manually by the operator, instead of
  being created automatically by AVEVA Production Management.
- AVEVA Production Management stores all original adjustment requests, which are later
  processed into adjustment records.
- The result of an adjustment event after processing has occurred.
- An adjustment changes the balance of the current quantity of material at an equipment
  item.
- An optional application used to create, edit, and manage PI AF collectives.
- The Microsoft SQL Server database that contains the configuration information and
  databases for a specific AF server.
- The acronym for the AF SQL Server database is PIFD.
- Alarms warn run-time operators about process conditions that could potentially cause
  problems.
- Typically, you set up an alarm to trigger when a process value exceeds a defined
  limit.
- Warns an operator about a process condition that could potentially cause a problem.
- Typically an alarm is set up to be triggered when a process value exceeds a defined
  limit.
- Alarms are detected by InTouch or AVEVA Application Server and recorded by AVEVA
  Historian's Alarm & Event History system.
- The date in an open period where the Prior Period Adjustment (PPA) for a closed
  period will be billed.
- A directory on a computer that is used to store files that have been moved out of
  the circular storage location.
- Produces summary statistics for analog tags for a recorded interval.

  logic, graphics, or other templates.
- A finite time range between the end time of one Archive file and the start time
  of the next chronological Archive file.
- Archive gaps are not desirable because Archive events with a timestamp during the
  gap cannot be stored on disk in an Archive file and will be discarded.
- To avoid Archive gaps, create Archive files such that the end time of one Archive
  equals the start time of the next Archive.
- The process of writing all the primary records, one for each existing point, to
  an archive file and cleaning and preparing overflow records in order to receive
  data.
- Contains the list of archive files known (registered) to Data Archive. The file
  name is piarstat.dat.
- The process of making a different archive file the primary archive. An archive shift
  typically occurs automatically when the primary archive becomes full.
- A flag that controls whether or not a specific Archive file is able to participate
  in Archive shifts.
- If the flag is disabled, that is, set to zero, then the Archive file does not participate
  in Archive shifts.
- Unlike a fixed Archive, once a dynamic Archive receives any data, the shift flag
  is automatically and permanently disabled.
- A database stored in the AF SQL Server database (PIFD). Asset Framework databases
  contain asset model data. Each PIFD database can contain multiple AF databases.
- An AVEVA Mobile Operator application in the Content Management group in the Management
  Center that facilitates the import, export, and manual addition and deletion of
  Assets.
- Automated rules that utilize stream data, such as identifiers, names, tags and metadata,
  to build assets and augment existing assets.
- The auto forecast allows the user to set up rules to automatically generate a daily
  forecast up to 10 days into the future.
- The auto forecast requires configuration of certain criteria, and using that criteria,
  the sendout could be forecasted automatically.
- When a Trainee enters a Course with OTS Activities, an OTS session is immediately
  auto-launched. This feature aims to reduce any wait times while the OTS session
  is being provisioned.
- A material movement that AVEVA Production Management records automatically.
- A process in which the resources in a project register the number of worked hours.

  and may be defined by a scan class or a time rule.
- Defines a format to build a commodity code from a combination of elements such as
  component type attribute and text.
- Provides useful information in troubleshooting problems.
- A base PI point attribute that specifies the compression deviation in engineering
  units. This value represents the maximum error when historical data values need
  to be interpolated, and should typically be set to the error of the underlying instrument.
- A base PI point attribute that specifies compression deviation as a percentage of
  span, another base attribute.
- A base PI point attribute that specifies the maximum compression setting and maximum
  amount of time in seconds that can elapse between values sent to the archive (overriding
  compression).
- Compression maximum and minimum time attributes. The compression process does not
  include events within the minimum time. Events will be included that occur before
  the maximum time.
- The compression process sends one event within each CompMin time.
- Another event is not sent until the CompMin has passed.
- The time is expressed in seconds.
- A collection of pure components, petrocomponents, and assay pseudocomponents that
  defines the components that are available in your fluid.
- You can use different component slates for your streams and unit operations to limit
  the components to only those that are present in the fluid instead of using all
  the components that are available in the simulation.
- The smaller number of components reduces the number of thermodynamic calculations
  that must be performed and therefore may improve performance.
- Addresses problems in feedstock composition tracking in chemical plants and oil
  refineries.
- A base PI point attribute that controls whether or not compression is performed
  for a particular point. If compressing is disabled, then compression for events
  will be skipped.

  versus supply in situations where there is an excess or a lack of supply.

- A degree day, also known as a heating degree day, is the number of degrees that
  the average daily temperature is below a specified reference (usually 65ºF). If
  the temperature is above the reference, the degree day is zero.

  to a work center as a destination or a source, depends on its role in the material
  movement.
- A material lot that is on the receiving end of a material movement. Whether you
  refer to a lot as a destination lot or a source lot depends on its role in the material
