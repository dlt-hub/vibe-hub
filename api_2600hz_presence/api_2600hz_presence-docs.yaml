auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.2600hz.com/developers/rest/account-actions-and-permissions/apps-store/:
  - 'Authentication is required via the X-Auth-Token header. Include the header "X-Auth-Token:
    {AUTH_TOKEN}" in all requests to authenticate. The token value should be obtained
    from the authentication system and passed as the header value in each API call.'
  - Authentication is required via the X-Auth-Token header. Send the auth token in
    the X-Auth-Token request header for all API calls. Some endpoints require specific
    account roles, such as reseller status for accessing the blacklist endpoint.
  - 'Authentication uses a bearer token passed via the X-Auth-Token header. Include
    the header "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" in requests, where {AUTH_TOKEN} is replaced
    with the actual authentication token value.'
  - Authentication uses a custom header X-Auth-Token that must be included in all
    requests. The token value is passed as {AUTH_TOKEN} in the X-Auth-Token header.
  - Authentication uses a custom header-based token scheme. The X-Auth-Token header
    must be included in requests with a valid auth token value. Access is restricted
    to Super Duper admin users who own the cluster.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.2600hz.com/developers/rest/authentication/multi-factor-auth/:
  - Use offset-based pagination with page_size (optional, default 1) and start_key
    (optional) query parameters. Response includes page_size, start_key, and data
    array; use the start_key value from response in next request to retrieve additional
    pages.
- information_source; https://docs.2600hz.com/developers/rest/sys-admin/system-configs/:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with next_start_key returned in responses.
    Use the next_start_key value as the start_key query parameter in subsequent requests.
    The page_size field indicates the number of items returned per page (default 50).
    Stop paginating when next_start_key is not present in the response.
