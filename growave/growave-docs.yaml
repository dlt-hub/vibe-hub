pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.growave.io/v2/docs:
  - Pagination for the "Get reviews" endpoint uses offset-based pagination. The offset
    query parameter (number, >= 0) specifies the starting position for results. The
    response structure and stopping condition are not provided in the documentation
    excerpt.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (number >= 1, default 1) and perPage (number
    between 1 and 250) to control results per request and navigate through multiple
    galleries or product media. Response includes galleries or productMedia arrays;
    construct next request by incrementing page parameter until desired results are
    retrieved.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (number, >= 1, default 1) and perPage (number,
    1-250, default 10). Response includes totalCount, currentPage, and perPage fields
    to track pagination state; construct next request by incrementing page parameter
    until currentPage reaches the final page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (number, >= 1, default 1) and perPage (number,
    range 1-250) to request specific pages. The response contains wishlistItems array
    but does not include next page indicators or total count fields, so pagination
    state must be inferred by comparing returned items count against perPage value.
  - Query parameters page (number, >= 1, default 1) and perPage (number) control pagination.
    Use page to navigate between result sets and perPage to set results per request.
