  - The CipherTrust Manager REST API uses token-based authentication. To authenticate,
    send a POST request to the /api/v1/auth/tokens/ endpoint with a JSON body containing
    "name" and "password" fields. The response provides an API token that can be used
    for subsequent requests. Optionally, include a "domain" field in the request body
    to authenticate to a specific child domain instead of the root domain.
