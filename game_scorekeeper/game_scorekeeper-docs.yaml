auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gamescorekeeper.com/:
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the header Authorization:
    Bearer <Your Token> in all REST API requests to https://api.gamescorekeeper.com.
    Missing or invalid authorization headers will result in a 401 status code.'
  - Connecting to the APIs requires an authentication token, which is obtained by
    creating an account with GameScorekeeper. Contact sales@gamescorekeeper.com to
    create an account and receive your authentication token. The token must be provided
    when connecting to both the REST API and Live Data API, though the specific header
    or parameter name for sending the token is not detailed in this excerpt.
  - Send a JSON object with a bearer token in the "token" field to authenticate. The
    bearer token is the same as used for the REST API. The server responds with a
    message of type "auth" upon successful authentication.
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication for WebSocket connections. Send a JSON
    message with type "auth" and your bearer token in the format {"token": "<your
    bearer token>"}, which is the same token used for REST API authentication. The
    server responds with {"type": "auth"} to confirm successful authentication.'

    authorization header will result in a 401 status code.'
