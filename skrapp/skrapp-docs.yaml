auth_info:
- information_source; https://skrapp.io/api:
  - API authentication requires the X-Access-Key header with your API key value. This
    header must be included in all requests to access the Email Finder and Bulk Email
    Finder endpoints. API features are only available to paid accounts.
  - API key authentication is required, passed via the X-Access-Key header in each
    request. Include your API key in the X-Access-Key header with the value set to
    your actual API key string.
  - API key authentication is required. Include your API key in the HTTP request header
    with the exact header name "X-Access-Key". The API key serves for both authentication
    and identification, so it must be kept confidential. API features are only available
    to paid accounts.
  - API key authentication via HTTP header. Include the X-Access-Key header with your
    API key in all requests to the Skrapp API. The API key is required and only available
    to paid accounts.
  - 'The API requires an X-Access-Key header containing your API key, sent with each
    request. This key is only available to paid accounts and must be included in the
    HTTP headers as "X-Access-Key: Your API Key".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://skrapp.io/api:
  - The List Leads endpoint uses offset-based pagination with start and size query
    parameters. The start parameter specifies the offset (default 0), size specifies
    results per page (default/example 100), and the response includes count_results
    for total results and next_start indicating the offset for the next page request.
  - Use the nextId query parameter (optional, returned in response) to paginate through
    results. Include nextId from the previous response in the next request to retrieve
    the next set of results. The size parameter (optional, max 150) controls results
    per request.
  - Use the size query parameter to control page size (default appears to be 10).
    Use next_results_id from the meta object in the response to fetch the next page
    by passing it as a parameter in the subsequent request. Stop pagination when next_results_id
    is not returned.
  - start query parameter controls pagination by specifying the maximum lead ID value
    (not inclusive), with optional size parameter defaulting to 25 leads per query
    (max 500). Response includes next_start field to use as start value in the next
    request, and count_results for total results.
