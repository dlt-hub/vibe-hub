notes:
- Add .env to .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing the API key to version
  control.
- Do not pass the API key directly to the code, because others could see and use your
  API key.
- 'If using a .env file: Add .env to .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing
  the API key to version control.'
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Users on the Team, Visionary, and Enterprise plans can turn on zero data retention
  (ZDR) directly in the user interface.
- Agentic Document Extraction is now available in Europe.
- For EU users, use the endpoint https://api.va.eu-west-1.landing.ai/v1/ade/parse
- The file can be a PDF (50 pages max) or an image (50MB)
- 'Get your API key here: https://va.landing.ai/settings/api-key'
- The Playground is not intended for production use. It has certain limitations and
  is best suited for small-scale testing and exploration.
- Uses API Key for authentication.
- Uses API Key for authentication
- Configurable through connectors for various sources.
- Deprecated chunk types should be updated in the code to use the new types.
- Markdown representation of the document is provided in the response.
- Chunking improves retrieval granularity and maintains human readability.
- Extracted data is returned in a hierarchical JSON format.
- Images are saved with a specific structure based on the timestamp and page number.
- Visualization shows bounding boxes around each extracted chunk
- Custom colors for different chunk types available
- Uses ParseConfig to group multiple parsing options.
- The parsing functions below were deprecated in v0.2.3 of the library.
- Deprecated functions will continue to work in later versions, but we recommend implementing
  the parse function instead.
- The parsing functions were deprecated in v0.2.3 of the library.
- Use parse function for document parsing.
- The parsing functions are deprecated in v0.2.3 of the library.
- Visual groundings can be saved to a directory.
- Field extraction costs 3 credits per page.
- For optimal performance, include no more than 30 properties in your extraction schema.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Use the parse_documents function for immediate processing.
- Use the parse_and_save_documents function for persistence and auditing.
- Requires API key for authentication.
- Schemas created in the Playground are saved to chat history.
- Confidence score feature is experimental and may not return accurate results.
- Data extracted from tables will have a null confidence score.
- Only JSON schema version 2020-12 is supported.
- The top-level element of the schema must be 'object'.
- Rate limits help ensure that the API stays fast and available for everyone.
- Rate limits prevent any single user or accidental spike in traffic from slowing
  things down for others.
- The library automatically handles the rate limit error or other intermittent HTTP
  errors with retries.
- The maximum parallelism allowed by the library is 100.
- Maximum parallelism allowed by the library is 100
- The maximum file size is 50MB.
- Doesn’t support parsing password-protected PDFs.
- Extraction accuracy influenced by script type, image clarity, and formatting.
- API keys are deployment-specific. An API key created in the US will not work for
  the EU, and vice versa.
- Submit a support ticket by emailing support@landing.ai
- If you experience an issue, send an email to support@landing.ai
- Committed to protecting your data and maintaining the highest security standards.
- ZDR is applicable when parsing documents with the agentic-doc library and when calling
  the ADE API directly.
- Zero Data Retention (ZDR) option provides the highest level of data privacy and
  control for sensitive documents.

- Standard processing (3-5 business days acceptable)
- parses and extracts structured data from unstructured documents like PDFs and images.
- The app creates an X-Small warehouse called LANDING_DOC_EXTRACTION_APP.
- The app automatically updates when a new version is released.
- These processes require you to grant permission to run Cortex functions.
- Default app name is LANDINGAI_AGENTIC_DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION.
- Local Processing maintains zero data retention (ZDR).
- Local Processing can parse up to 20 pages per minute.
- Uses API key for authentication — ensure it's entered in Snowsight
- Cloud Processing uses your LandingAI account.
- If you want Zero Data Retention (ZDR) with Cloud Processing, you must first enable
  ZDR in your LandingAI account.
- Uses Python-compatible regular expressions for filtering files.
- To reduce credit usage, you can suspend the app when it’s not in use.
- Grant the app access to run Cortex.
- This error may occur when you try to run Cloud Processing and the database for the
  Snowsight Worksheet doesn’t match the database defined in your code. To resolve
  this issue, update the database to match the database that has the files you want
  to process.
- 'You might get an error similar to the following when you try to run Local Processing:
