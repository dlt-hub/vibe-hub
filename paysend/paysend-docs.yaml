notes:
- Asynchronous flow is the main flow to interact with API.
- Synchronous flow is not available for the Enterprise product.
- All API requests must include a digital signature in the X-OPP-Signature header.
- Idempotency is implemented using a unique idempotency key and request timestamp.
- The Sandbox Mock Service is intended for testing purposes only and does not perform
  actual payment processing.
- The service provides consistent, static responses to simplify integration testing.
- Our system processes payouts asynchronously across multiple services.
- When your payout request receives an initial 'accepted' status, there is a brief
  propagation delay while the transaction details are synchronized internally.
- You must wait at least 3 minutes after receiving the 'accepted' status before using
  the task.statusGet method.
