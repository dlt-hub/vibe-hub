auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.phrase.com/en/api/strings/getting-started:
  - The API requires HTTP Basic Authentication using either an email address or an
    access token. Credentials are passed via the -u flag (which sets the Authorization
    header with Base64-encoded credentials). Additionally, a User-Agent header with
    contact information is mandatory; requests without it will receive a 400 Bad Request
    response. The User-Agent format should be "Application Name (contact@example.com)"
    or "Company Name Python Client (http://example.com/contact)".
  - To authenticate a JSONP request to the Phrase API, send a valid access token as
    the access_token query parameter in the request URL. For example, append ?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN
    to your request alongside other parameters like callback.
- information_source; https://developers.phrase.com/en/api/strings/authentication:
  - Phrase Platform API supports three authentication methods. First, Phrase Platform
    JWT tokens generated via the platform authentication endpoint. Second, HTTP Basic
    authentication using email and password credentials sent as username:password.
    Third, OAuth access tokens that can be passed as the username in Basic auth format
    (ACCESS_TOKEN:), sent via the Authorization header as "token ACCESS_TOKEN", or
    sent as a query parameter named access_token. The query parameter method should
    only be used when header or Basic auth is not possible.
  - 'Phrase Platform API supports three authentication methods: Phrase Platform API
    tokens (preferred), email and password, and OAuth access tokens. API tokens should
    be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Email/password authentication
    and OAuth token details are referenced but not fully detailed in this excerpt.
    Consult the full Authentication documentation page for complete implementation
    specifics on each method.'
  - 'Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) tokens must be sent via the X-PhraseApp-OTP header
    when required by the API response. The API indicates 2FA is required by returning
    an X-PhraseApp-OTP: required; :MFA-type header, where :MFA-type specifies the
    token source (e.g., app for Authenticator applications). Include the 2FA token
    in requests using the X-PhraseApp-OTP header with the token value, for example:
    X-PhraseApp-OTP: MFA-TOKEN. Some endpoints also require an eight-digit account
    ID parameter if the authenticated user belongs to multiple accounts, which can
    be found in Translation Center.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.phrase.com/en/api/strings/pagination:
  - Endpoints returning lists use the query parameter page (starting from page 1)
    to access further pages, with a default of 25 items per page. Some endpoints support
    the per_page query parameter to customize page size.
  - Use query parameter `page` (required, defaults to 1) to navigate pages, with optional
    `per_page` parameter (max 100 items, default unspecified) to set page size. Response
    includes Link header with rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next", and rel="last"
    containing full pagination URLs for each direction; construct next request by
    following the appropriate rel link URL.
