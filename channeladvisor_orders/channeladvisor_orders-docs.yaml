auth_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.channeladvisor.com/kc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0017869:
  - 'All requests to the REST API endpoints (except /oauth2) require a valid access
    token provided via one of two methods: as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header, or as an access_token query string parameter. OAuth 2.0 Authorization,
    Developer Console, and SOAP API Credentials are supported authentication types
    for obtaining access tokens.


    Bearer Authorization Header (preferred): Include Authorization: Bearer [access
    token] in request headers.


    Query String Authorization: Include access_token=[access token] as a query parameter
    in the request URL.'
  - Refresh tokens must be used every 29 days to maintain active integration. Register
    applications through the developer console at https://api.channeladvisor.com/developerconsole
    to obtain an application ID and shared secret. OAuth 2.0 authorization is required
    with a Brands Platform User account that has Group Admin permissions. A Developer
    Key and Password are also required to complete the authorization process.
- information_source; https://knowledge.channeladvisor.com/kc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0017870:
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication with authorization scopes controlling access
    levels. Refresh tokens must be used every 29 days to prevent expiration and "Invalid
    Grant" errors; access tokens are obtained via the token endpoint at https://api.channeladvisor.com/oauth2/token.
    Available scopes are orders, orders.readonly, inventory, and inventory.readonly,
    which can be combined with spaces. The authorization endpoint is https://api.channeladvisor.com/oauth2/authorize,
    the identity endpoint is https://api.channeladvisor.com/oauth2/identity, and the
    revoke endpoint is https://api.channeladvisor.com/oauth2/revoke. Required OAuth
    2.0 parameters include application ID, shared secret (client secret), redirect
    URI, response type, authorization code, and grant type. Refresh tokens expire
    30 days after the last access token generation.
- information_source; https://knowledge.channeladvisor.com/kc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0017947:
  - The API requires an access token passed as a query parameter named access_token
    in the request URL. Include access_token=xxxxxxxxxx in the query string when making
    requests to the endpoint.
  - The API uses access token-based authentication passed as a query parameter. Include
    `access_token=<your_token>` in the query string of API requests, as shown in the
    @odata.nextLink example URL.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.channeladvisor.com/kc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0017947:
  - The API uses OData-style pagination with a $skip parameter for offset-based navigation.
    The response includes an @odata.nextLink field containing the complete URL for
    the next page of results, which should be used to fetch subsequent pages until
    @odata.nextLink is absent.
- information_source; https://knowledge.channeladvisor.com/kc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0018050:
  - The API uses OData-style pagination with a $skip parameter for offset-based navigation.
    The response includes an @odata.nextLink field containing the full URL for the
    next page of results, which increments the $skip parameter by 100 to retrieve
    the next batch of orders.
