- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Moving away from API and application keys to OAuth 2.0 authorization standard.
- We’re moving away from using API and application keys to the OAuth 2.0 authorization
  standard to provide a more secure, streamlined and efficient developer journey.
- In future, we're aiming to move to OAuth 2.0 for all Celonis use cases.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication with refresh token.
- Ensure all required permissions are granted for API access.
- No specific changes or features mentioned for the year 2025.
- Following the update, delta loads may fail if the 'Include metadata changes' option
  is not enabled in the extraction settings.
- To avoid issues, we recommend running a full extraction once the new version is
  available.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits or require special permissions
- Refer to the API documentation for detailed endpoint usage.
- The Issue table’s column structure will be altered.
- Delta loads may fail if the 'Include metadata changes' option is not enabled in
  the extraction settings.
- Ensure proper setup of connected app in SAP for OAuth2
- Monitor data connections regularly for performance issues
- The Standard Data Ingestion API is now accessible to all Celonis clients in General
  Availability.
- It is recommended that users utilize the Standard Data Ingestion API in new implementations
  instead of the Data Push API.
- New features introduced in the September 2025 Release Notes
- This API requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Ensure correct permissions are set for accessing the data.
- This feature is currently available as a Private Preview only
- New endpoints resolve issues from URL length limitations by sending query parameters
  in the request body
- Some API responses may vary based on user permissions
- Some API calls may require specific permissions

- Extraction preview is available only for JDBC connections.
- The statement that no additional configuration has to be added is not 100% correct
  as of today
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions set up for data access.
- Some objects like BlockedInvoice may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The number of parallel running jobs does not increase the limit of parallel running
  table extractions but only generates a queue.
- Always check the extraction times, CPU load and memory usage on the source system
  and on the extractor server.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 application in Celonis.
- Be aware of API rate limits.
- This extractor is currently in limited availability mode and can be added to your
  Celonis Platform environment by request only.
- You should use Java 21 exclusively.
- Replacing BSEG with its corresponding secondary index tables
- BSEG is a cluster table, which means it does not actually store real values but
  simply references other tables' values.
- The replacement tables (BSIK, BSAK, BSID, BSAK) contain less columns than BSEG.
  Hence, the replacement could lead to missing fields.
- Partitioning of extractions is supported only when the extraction mode is set to
  'Full Load'.
- The more equal the data is distributed across partitions, the more effective the
  extractions will be.
- Requires setting up OAuth2 credentials in Celonis.
- API limits may apply depending on the account level.
- Activating the live extraction mode in the Celonis Platform is required.
- Creating changelog tables to store the changes in the source system is necessary.
- Installing triggers to monitor the changes in the source systems is needed.
- Connection between on-premise extractors and the Celonis Platform is always established
  by the extractor.
- Only a one-way connection is required.
- Some endpoints may return paginated responses
- The Extractions Editor is designed for read-only access and supporting queries intended
  to retrieve data without modification.
- Debug mode provides detailed log information for the data extraction job and will
  be displayed in the execution logs.
- Ensure that the API is properly authenticated before making requests.
- You need to sign a consent form to use the Extractions Editor and AI Assistant during
  the Limited Availability phase.
- Some endpoints may require additional permissions
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in material allocation
- Transformation tasks are used to create event logs from your extracted data.
- Transformations from the Celonis Marketplace can't be renamed or copied to a regular
  task.
- API may have specific permissions required for different endpoints
- Date null checks work differently compared to HANA.
- Inserting multiple rows at once works differently in Vertica.
- API may require specific permissions for data access.
- Rate limits are enforced on API calls.
- For a stable and optimized data pipeline, we recommend executing delta transformations
  in your data model.
- Delta transformations process only the new or updated records from your data, rather
  than the full load each time.
- Setup for OAuth2 is required
- Delta transformations focus on updating only newly extracted or changed data instead
  of updating the entire data set.
- Using delta transformations can significantly improve performance, especially with
  large datasets.
- The _CELONIS_CHANGE_DATE automatically gets added to each record when written into
  the Celonis Data Storage.
- OAuth authentication provides a securer authentication method compared to the legacy
  custom client_id/client_secret approach.
- Private keys are securely stored, preventing unauthorized extraction or exposure.
- Regularly rotating your encryption keys enhances security by limiting the amount
  of data exposed if a key is compromised.
- Values in the Secret must be base64 encoded.
- Ensure correct sizing requirements in the Deployment.
- 'Complete reload: All tables are completely reloaded as part of an execution.'
- 'Partial reload: Only the selected tables are reloaded as part of an execution.'
- Setup of connected app is required for OAuth2.
- Requires setup of a Kubernetes cluster and RBAC.
- Make sure to encode sensitive information in base64.
- If your environment requires proxy access, uncomment the proxy-related sections
  in both the Secret and Deployment.
- If you need to connect to internal databases, modify the NetworkPolicy.
- When executing your data jobs, you can choose between full and delta loads.
- 'Full load: You extract and transform all of the table’s data.'
- 'Delta load: You extract and transform only new data that has been added to a table
  since the last load.'
- The values here are base64 encoded. You must encode your actual secrets.
- Adjust accordingly per your sizing requirements.
- Some objects may have specific configurations or attributes based on their types
- For a stable and optimized data pipeline, we recommend executing delta extractions
  from your source system using SQL upserts.
- Delta extractions refer to the process of identifying and extracting only the data
  that has changed (added or updated) since the last extraction or data refresh.
- All view-based tables in the data model need to have an epoch column for delta data
  model load to work.
- Schedules run sequentially, meaning that they attempt to successfully execute each
  task before moving on to the next.
- The upper limit of the maximum retry attempts is 10 to avoid endless retries.
- Java 17 is the minimum required version.
- Ensure compatibility and leverage the latest enhancements and security features.
- The following file names refer to the SAP extractor. The exact same steps can be
  performed for other on-premise extractor types. Simply replace 'Sap' with the name
  of the connection type.
- Currently Replication Cockpit can be used only for pipelines running on SAP ECC
  extractor.
- The Replication Cockpit will function properly only if the real time extractor has
  been enabled in the source SAP system.
- Ensure to handle token expiration properly.
- RC supports real-time extractions and transformations for Transactional and Metadata
  tables.
- Initialization functionality allows execution of full loads in the RC.
- Requires configuration settings specific to the Payment Term Checker app.
- Some objects may return null values in nested fields
- Integration requires setup of connected app in API
- SAP User should have minimum rights to create the tables and add triggers, usually
  performed by SAP BASIS.
- Triggers cannot be transported and should be installed in QA and then PRD.
- Ensure proper setup for the Payment Term Checker app.
- When you migrate from case-centric process mining to object-centric process mining,
  you will need to revise your transformations to reflect the changes in the data
  model.
- Ensure to configure the data pool correctly to avoid missing data.
- Celonis does not recommend using IP allowlisting for Celonis IPs as destination.
  Instead, if your firewall allows filtering rules, Celonis recommends allowlisting
  fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
- If you do not add these domains, some Celonis Platform features may not be available.
- Requires setup of OAuth application in the API platform
- Ensure correct permissions are granted for data access
- Requires setup of OAuth2 client in Celonis.
- Data jobs allow extraction, transformation, and loading of data into models.
- Note that you should add ONLY the tables for which the triggers have been activated
  in SAP.
- While CDPOS and CDHDR are exceptions and you can use them without change logs, we
  strongly recommend to create a change log for them too.
- Change Logs for these tables are supported for S/4 HANA systems, and also SAP ECC
  on MS SQL and Oracle databases (with the latest RFC Module).
- In Replication Cockpit, there is no concept of delta filters anymore. The SAP real
  time extractor ensures that replications capture the delta automatically.
- Make sure to remove the tables added to the Replication Cockpit tables in the Delta
  Data Jobs. There should be no conflict between Replication Cockpit and data jobs,
  i.e. the same table should not be replicated via Replication Cockpit and delta loaded
  via data jobs. Otherwise, execution conflicts may occur if these two tools try to
  write data to the same Celonis Platform table concurrently.
- Requires API key for authentication
- Rate limits apply
- The times are in UTC timezone. Make sure to account for the difference to your timezone.
- Requires setup for OAuth2 authentication.
- Ensure correct scopes are included in OAuth settings.
- Cluster tables should be excluded/replaced if possible.
- Alerts are sent out to the user who activated the toggle via e-mail.
- Every user can activate the toggle separately in order to receive notifications.
- It may take up to five minutes before you receive the email.
- Ensure to configure OAuth2 settings correctly for access
- Rate limits may apply to API requests
- BSEG is a cluster table which means it does not actually store real values but simply
  references other tables' values.
- Installing the Sustainable Spend Management app in Studio
- The number of concurrently running extractions will be limited by the limit of parallel
  executions in your Data Connection settings.
- Some objects like Data Pool may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Monitor data jobs for performance and errors
- Users need to execute the trigger code that is supplied with the table in the Replication
  Cockpit.
- 'Trigger code will have two separate statements: ''Create Table'' and ''Trigger
  Table''.'
- Some attributes may return nulls in certain conditions
- Extraction setup is easy but requires new extraction logic.
- Transformation scripts should be re-written to adapt to the Replication Cockpit
  requirements.
- Some data may return nulls in nested fields
- Ensure that the API token is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- Delta load will include metadata changes (i.e. new columns) and run through with
  a warning.
- Real Time Transformations can be seen as the corresponding equivalent for transformation
  purposes.
- Transformations are always defined at table-level.
- Staging tables are cleaned up after each successful transformation.
- During the Limited Availability phase, you do need to sign a consent form to use
  the Extractions Editor and AI Assistant.
- Some actions may require specific permissions to access.
- Some endpoints may have limitations on data retrieval.
- Only select from raw tables (the tables that are extracted via the Replication Cockpit).
  Do not use tables that are created within other transformations!
- OAuth2 authentication is required to access the API.
- Ensure your account has the necessary permissions to access the endpoints.
- The identification of the trigger table for activities is probably the most important
  but at the same time also a very difficult step.
- To prevent this, each trigger table should have its own dedicated activity table.
- Parameters of the COALESCE function need to have the same data type in Vertica.
- All steps that are described in this section require changes only in the Data Job
  that contains the Full Transformations.
- Before the first execution of the new statement, the existing view needs to be dropped
  manually.
- In case an activity was not converted to the Delta Transformation logic, we recommend
  using the specific table "CEL_O2C_DJ_ACTIVITIES" (DJ = Data Job).
- Before the first execution of the new statement, the existing Activity table (_CEL_O2C_ACTIVITIES)
  needs to be dropped manually.
- API requires OAuth2 authentication and setup of connected app.
- When configuring delta transformations, you need to set the primary keys for each
  table.
- Real-Time Transformations are part of the Replication Cockpit.
- Some scripts for which it doesn't make sense like the creation of the currency conversion
  tables should still remain in Data Jobs.
- Replications may require specific configurations.
- For scenarios requiring low latency, the full transformation approach proves highly
  inefficient, resulting in long transformation times, particularly as data volume
  expands.
- The _CELONIS_CHANGE_DATE automatically gets added by the Celonis system to each
  and every record as an additional column.
- Data models can be created using the Celonis Platform to define and map business
  process data.
- Ensure to follow the API rate limits to avoid throttling.
- Some endpoints may have specific query parameters for filtering data.
- You can access your Monitoring overview page from your data pool overview page.
- Whenever a data job begins to execute, a log is created and added to the Execution
  History dashboard.
- We recommend setting up custom monitoring for longer execution history.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required for access.
- You can execute data jobs manually or based on an automated schedule, with both
  delta and full load executions possible.
- By default, data jobs run in sequential order.
- Real-time data integration with SAP requires correct setup of the API connection.
- Some endpoints may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- SQL upserts eliminate the need for multiple checks and separate insert or update
  operations, making your code more concise and efficient.
- Delta extractions refer to the process of identifying and extracting only the data
  that has changed since the last extraction or data refresh. This is particularly
  useful in ETL processes and in scenarios where real-time or near-real-time data
  updates are required.
- The monitoring data pool doesn't allow any data intake.
- Data consumption in the monitoring data pool is excluded from utilization storage
  and data model license calculations.
- The monitoring data pool can't be copied or exported.
- The data consumption_updated_events table is created with the first APC calculation
  for the team, which can take several days.
- The replication_execution_finished_events table is created with your first Replication
  Cockpit Execution.
- The update frequency may vary from team to team.
- Some objects may have specific configuration requirements.
- If a task fails to execute, all remaining tasks are canceled.
- Requires setup of connected app in PQL API
- Ensure to set up OAuth2 for API access
- API limits may apply depending on usage
- RC does not support all of the ETL use cases yet, and it has to co-exist with the
  DJs to enable a fully functional data pipeline.
- The executions of Full Extractions (in Data Jobs) and Replications (in Replication
  Cockpit) should be coordinated to avoid conflicts.
- We recommend using the Initialization functionality in Replication Cockpit for Full
  Loads instead of doing it in the Data Jobs.
- There can be only one Data Push Job per table at the same time; otherwise it can
  lead to data loss.
- You can monitor your data consumption across all data pools in your Celonis Platform
  team.
- The data you're consuming across your data pools is displayed in your license monitoring
  page.
- Ensure to configure the OAuth2 settings before integration.
- Requires setup of a connected app in Celonis Platform
- The SAP User should have minimum the following rights to be able to create the tables
  and add triggers.
- Triggers cannot be transported. They should be installed in QA (for testing) and
  then subsequently in PRD (for productive use).
- The clean up background job is an important element to control the size of the Log
  tables.
- Only add tables for which the triggers have been activated in SAP.
- CDPOS and CDHDR can be used without change logs, but it's recommended to create
  a change log for them too.
- Replications capture the delta automatically.
- Some objects may have limitations in real-time data processing.
- Alerts are sent out to the user who activated the toggle via e-mail. Every user
  can activate the toggle separately in order to receive notifications.
- Requires authentication setup in the API
- Some fields may return null values
- This setup checklist can be used to track the implementation status of Real-Time
  Connectivity to SAP.
- Extraction setup is pretty easy, still some effort is required to define the new
  extraction logic.
- Prerequisites for the object-centric Procurement Starter Kit
- Ensure proper user roles are assigned for API access.
- API rate limits apply.
- Each trigger table should have its own dedicated activity table.
- Ensure proper permissions are set in the Celonis platform
- In case an activity was not converted to the Delta Transformation logic, we recommend
  using the specific table **"CEL_O2C_DJ_ACTIVITIES"** (DJ = Data Job).
- Full Load is currently not supported in the Replication Cockpit.
- Data models can be created and configured through the Celonis Platform.
- Requires setup of connected app in the Payment Term Checker API
- Name mapping lets you translate technical and language specific data model terms
  to a user friendly format.
- The monitoring data pool doesn't allow any data intake, meaning that data connections,
  file uploads, data transfer imports, replication cockpit, streaming cockpit, and
  extractor builder are all disabled for this data pool.
- The data consumption listed in your monitoring data pool is not included in your
  utilization storage and is excluded from your data model license calculations.
- You aren't able to copy versions into the monitoring data pool or from the monitoring
  data pool to another.
- The tables of the custom data pipeline monitoring are created with the first events
  captured after enabling this feature. As such, no past data integration events are
  captured.
- Data consumption metrics displayed in the Data Integration section.
- License consumption consistent across dashboards.
