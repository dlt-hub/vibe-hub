auth_info:
- information_source; https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-registry-docs/rest-api/index.html:
  - API Key authentication is required, passed in the Authorization header. HTTP Basic
    Authentication is also supported as an alternative authentication method.
  - Client authentication is required to access this endpoint. The API returns 401
    if the client cannot be authenticated and 403 if the client is not authorized
    to make the request. The specific authentication mechanism and credential format
    are not documented in this excerpt.
  - Client authentication is required; the API returns 401 if the client cannot be
    authenticated and 403 if the client is not authorized to make the request. However,
    the specific authentication mechanism (headers, parameters, scheme) is not documented
    in the provided text.
  - 'Create tokens for REST API access using either auto-detected client identity
    verification or HTTP Basic Auth. Tokens are returned as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
    and must be sent in the Authorization header as ''Authorization: Bearer <token>''.
    Basic Auth requires the Authorization header in format ''Authorization: Basic
    <base64(username:password)>''.'
  - OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication is used. The flow involves initiating a login
    request at GET /access/oidc/request, exchanging credentials for a JWT via POST
    /access/oidc/exchange, and using callback URIs at GET /access/oidc/callback and
    GET /access/oidc/logout/callback for the OIDC provider's redirect responses. The
    JWT returned from the exchange endpoint is then used for subsequent authenticated
    API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://nifi.apache.org/nifi-docs/rest-api.html:
  - 'The GET /flow/bulletin-board endpoint uses optional query parameters for filtering
    and limiting results: after (includes bulletins with id after this value), sourceName,
    message, sourceId, groupId (all support regex matching), and limit (controls number
    of bulletins returned). No explicit pagination mechanism like page numbers, cursors,
    or next/previous tokens is described.'
