auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.xink.io/support/solutions/articles/1000224599-xink-api-reference:
  - There is no dedicated authorization scope for image access. It is enough to provide
    a token generated for valid client account. The documentation does not specify
    the exact mechanism for how this token should be transmitted (header name, parameter
    name, or format), so a complete auth implementation cannot be determined from
    this excerpt.
  - 'Xink uses OAuth2 with the ClientCredentialsGrant flow. Clients must obtain an
    access token from the authorization server at https://auth.xink.io/OAuth/Token
    by sending a POST request with grant_type set to "client_credentials", along with
    client_id, client_secret, and desired scopes. The returned access token must then
    be included in all subsequent API requests.


    To set up credentials, create an API user in the Xink admin portal under Preferences
    -> Admins with appropriate permissions and password. Required token request parameters
    are: grant_type (must be "client_credentials"), client_id, client_secret, and
    scope (space-separated list of required scopes, such as "employeeread"). The authorization
    server URI is https://auth.xink.io and the token endpoint is /OAuth/Token.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.xink.io/support/solutions/articles/1000224599-xink-api-reference:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit path parameters, both optional with defaults
    of offset=0 and limit=500. Response includes Limit and Offset fields; iterate
    by incrementing offset by the limit value until fewer items than limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses path parameters offset (default 0) and limit (default 500) to
    control results. The response includes Limit, Offset, and Items array fields.
    Use the returned Offset and Limit values to construct subsequent requests until
    fewer items than the limit are returned.
  - Request uses path parameters offset (default 0) and limit (default 500) to paginate
    through employees. Response returns Offset, Limit, and Items array; construct
    next request by incrementing offset by the limit value to retrieve subsequent
    pages.
  - Use offset and limit path parameters for pagination. offset (default 0) specifies
    the starting position, and limit (default 500) specifies the number of items per
    page. This applies to employee/list, image/list, and signature/list endpoints.
