auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.whatfix.com:
  - API authentication token is required; contact your administrator for token configuration
    and TTL details. The token should be sent as an authentication credential with
    requests to the audit log endpoint. API rate limiting is enforced.
  - To get authenticated you need to create a user API token from the Whatfix dashboard
    and pass it as the header x-whatfix-integration-key. Additionally, pass the email
    address of the user as the x-whatfix-user header. Both headers are required for
    most endpoints.
- information_source; https://developer.whatfix.com/:
  - API authentication token with configurable TTL is required; contact your administrator
    for setup. The token should be sent in the request headers (exact header name
    not specified in documentation). API rate limiting is enforced.
  - 'To authenticate with the Whatfix API, pass two required headers with each request:
    x-whatfix-integration-key (the user API token obtained from the Whatfix dashboard)
    and x-whatfix-user (the email address of the user). The API is stateless and validates
    all requests against the provided token.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.whatfix.com:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with query parameters cursor (optional, for navigating
    to next page) and limit (optional, default value not specified). The response
    includes a cursor field to retrieve the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with query parameters cursor (string,
    optional), limit (integer, optional with default), and fromTime (integer, optional
    with default). Use the cursor value from the response to fetch the next page by
    passing it in the subsequent request.
  - Pagination uses query parameters cursor (string, for cursor position) and limit
    (integer with default value) in the request, with a cursor value returned in the
    response to construct subsequent requests for fetching additional audit log pages.
  - The "Get all tags" endpoint uses cursor-based pagination with query parameters
    cursor (string) and limit (integer, default value not fully specified). The response
    structure for pagination fields is not provided in the documentation.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with query parameters cursor (string, cursor
    value) and limit (integer with default value, exact default not fully specified
    in excerpt). The cursor parameter is used to navigate through paginated results.
