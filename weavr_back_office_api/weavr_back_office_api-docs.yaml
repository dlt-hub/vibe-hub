auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.weavr.io/start/backoffice/multi-backoffice-api/:
  - Weavr uses token-based authentication for Back-Office API calls. Obtain an access
    token by calling POST /backoffice/access_token, then use this token in subsequent
    API requests. The API keys and endpoints differ between Sandbox (https://sandbox.weav...)
    and Live environments, which are provided upon business review.
- information_source; https://docs.weavr.io/start/backoffice/multi-backoffice-authentication/:
  - Obtain an access token via POST /backoffice/access_token using your credentials,
    then include this token in subsequent Back-Office API calls for authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.weavr.io/start/multi-authentication-overview/:
  - Auth Token is provided after successful login and identifies the user and authentication
    method (password, passcode, biometrics). For use-cases involving root users linked
    to multiple identities or biometrics, the Auth Token must be exchanged for an
    Access Token, which contains the additional identity information needed to grant
    proper access. The Access Token is the primary credential used in API requests.
  - The API uses three layers of authentication. Account authentication identifies
    application requests and is required for all API calls. End-user authentication
    uses an Auth Token to authenticate Admin Users and Authorised Users, required
    for most API requests. End-user step-up authentication requires a stepped-up Auth
    Token obtained after passing SCA-compliant multifactor authentication for certain
    PSD2-regulated operations. Depending on the operation, provide either account
    authentication alone, or account plus end-user authentication via Auth Token,
    or account plus step-up end-user authentication. The documentation mentions exchanging
    an Auth Token for an Access Token in certain use cases.
- information_source; https://docs.weavr.io/start/quick-start-15-minutes/:
  - API authentication uses a programme key sent as a custom header. Include the header
    "programme-key" with your API key value in all requests to authenticate. The API
    key should be populated from your credential form.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.weavr.io/blog/tags/multi-api/:
  - Use the `limit` query parameter in GET requests to `/multi/managed_accounts/{id}/statement`
    and `/multi/managed_cards/{id}/statement` to specify desired items per page, with
    a maximum of 500 (default 100, or configured limit up to 500). Requests including
    periods before April 1, 2025 are capped at 100 items maximum.
