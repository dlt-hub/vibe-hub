pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.iva-api.com/guides/entertainment-api-guide:
  - Pagination uses Skip and Take query parameters. Skip specifies the number of records
    to skip (default 0), and Take specifies the maximum number of records to return
    per request (default varies by endpoint). Continue paginating by incrementing
    Skip by the Take value until fewer than Take records are returned, indicating
    the last page.
  - 'Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme with two query parameters: Take (number
    of items per page, required) and NextPageToken (optional, passed in subsequent
    requests). The response includes a NextPageToken field; pass this value to the
    NextPageToken parameter in the next request to retrieve the following page, keeping
    all other parameters unchanged.'
  - Skip and Take are query parameters for pagination. Skip specifies the number of
    records to skip (default 0), and Take specifies the maximum number of records
    to return per request (default 50). To paginate, increment Skip by the Take value
    for each subsequent request until fewer than Take records are returned.
  - Use Skip (offset, starting at 0) and Take (page size) query parameters for pagination.
    Fetch results using Skip=0, Take=10, then increment Skip by Take value for subsequent
    pages. Continue paginating until the number of returned results is less than the
    Take value, indicating the final page.
