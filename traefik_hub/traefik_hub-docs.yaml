  - 'Microcks provider supports multiple authentication methods: clientId and clientSecret
    for OAuth2-style authentication, a direct token field for bearer token auth, and
    an auth.endpoint for token acquisition. TLS certificates can be configured via
    tls.ca and tls.cert fields. All auth credentials are specified as empty strings
    by default in hub.providers.microcks.auth configuration.'

  - 'The API key authentication requires sending a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The API key should be base64-encoded and passed as Authorization: Bearer
    <base64-encoded-key>. A 401 status is returned if the Authorization header is
    missing or invalid, and a 200 status is returned when valid credentials are provided.'

  - 'Auth information is present in this documentation chunk. Here is the summary:


    Traefik Hub API Management supports multiple authentication methods for managed
    applications. API consumers can authenticate using JWT tokens or API keys issued
    by publishers. The ManagedApplication resource stores and manages JWT and API
    key credentials, which can be provided inline or by reference. Publishers pre-provision
    appId, API keys, and quotas, allowing consumers to call APIs immediately without
    portal login using their assigned JWT or API key credentials.'
- information_source; https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-hub/authentication-authorization/key-authentication:
  - 'API Keys are used for authentication by including them in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token. Create API Keys in the Portal, then pass them as `Authorization:
    Bearer XXXX` in request headers.'
- information_source; https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-hub/authentication-authorization/oracle/oci-iam-identity-domain:
  - OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type is used for authentication. To obtain a token,
    make a POST request to your Oracle Identity Cloud Service domain URL with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id, client_secret, and scope parameters in the request body using application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    content type. The scope format is urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__. For JWT authentication,
    retrieve the JWKs URI from the .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint at your
    IDCS URL.
