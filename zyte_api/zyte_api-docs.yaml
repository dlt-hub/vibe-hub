notes:
- All requests require basic authentication.
- Use your Zyte API key as username, and no password.
- The request body size limit is 5MiB.
- Zyte API will use a geolocation that, for the target website, does not cause bans
  or unexpected locale changes in the response data.
- Get powerful browser automation with Zyte API.
- Ensure you have valid authentication tokens.
- Rate limits apply to API usage.
- Use the Zyte API key for authentication.
- Set httpResponseBody request field to true to get the Base64-encoded response body.
- Redirection works differently in browser requests.
- Uses Basic Auth with API key
- Supports both plain text and binary data
- Uses Basic Auth with API key.
- Browser requests do not support an HTTP request method, body, or header other than
  Referer.
- During a browser request, additional requests may be sent with no limitation on
  method, body or headers.
- Set the screenshot request field to true to get a webpage screenshot.
- Only the Referer header can be overridden this way.
- Total browser execution time is limited to 60 seconds.
- Selectors cannot interact with iframes or with the shadow DOM.
- Setting geolocation explicitly affects request cost.
- Setting ipType explicitly requires completing KYC procedure.
- Uses Basic Authentication with API key in the Authorization header.
- Uses a session ID for requests.
- Client-managed sessions offer a lower-level API that lets you do more but also requires
  you to do more.
- Requests that do not reuse a previous session count as browser requests.
- Proxy mode does not support server-managed sessions.
- This is a demo website for web scraping purposes.
- 'Requires JavaScript: false'
- Use your Zyte API key here, not a Scrapy Cloud API key. Make sure you get this from
  the Zyte API access page.
- Rate limits are based on requests per minute, not concurrent requests.
- The number of parallel requests can be set to optimize throughput based on rate
  limits.
- Ensure to handle pagination correctly for multiple pages.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The stats API has a rate limit of 20 requests per minute.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Install and configure code example requirements and the Zyte CA certificate to run
  the example.
- Uses Basic authentication with API key
- Install and configure code example requirements and the Zyte CA certificate to run
  the example below.
- A fictional bookstore that desperately wants to be scraped.
- Pagination is supported, with a maximum of 20 items per page.
- JavaScript is not required to access the data.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- May return responses in base64 encoding
- Pagination is handled through page numbers in the URL.
- Response headers are always included in the HTTP response in proxy mode.
- Requires setup of Zyte API key for authentication
- Use your Zyte API key here, not a Scrapy Cloud API key.
- Uses Basic Auth with API Key
- Use of session management for requests
- Responses are base64 encoded
- Use evaluate action to access shadow DOM content.
- You need to enable third-party cookies on the zyte.group domain.
- Volume discounts are applied to each request.
- Custom volume discount for Enterprise plans.
- Standard plans have a volume discount based on monthly commitment.
- You are only charged for successful responses.
- Rate-limiting and unsuccessful responses are free.
- The size limit of browserHtml and httpResponseBody (before base64-encoding) is 10
  MB. Longer responses are truncated.
- When using a stack, you can use Scrapy Cloud add-ons to extend your code
- Scrapy Cloud supports defining spider templates that can be customized to create
  new spiders.
- This function was introduced in scrapinghub-entrypoint-scrapy 0.12.
- A standard proxy API is used to access Smart Proxy Manager that is controlled using
  special HTTP headers prefixed by `X-Crawlera`.
- Returned errors are internal to Smart Proxy Manager and are subject to change at
  any time, so should not be relied on.
- To fetch HTTPS web pages you need to download and install the certificate file or
  disable SSL certificate verification.
- Proxy-Authorization header is required on 8010, 8011 and 8014 ports otherwise HTTP
  407 response is returned.
- Smart Proxy Manager does not provide raw IPs, delivers requests with artificial
  delays.
- The first page may take longer to load while warming up a pool of clean IPs.
- Field values should always be encoded.
- Pricing is per bandwidth (GB transferred) instead of successful requests
- No automatic retries by default when using Smart Proxy Manager Residential
- Region selection is not possible when using sessions API, therefore X-Crawlera-Region
  and X-Crawlera-Session headers are not compatible.
- Sessions expire 30 minutes after the last request sent through that session.
- The maximum number of sessions that can be created at any point in time is 5000.
- You must first install the Zyte CA certificate.
- Some HTTP client libraries, including Apache HttpComponents Client and .NET, don’t
  send authentication headers by default.
- Trust own CA and all self-signed certs
- Some HTTP client libraries including Apache HttpComponents Client and .NET don’t
  send authentication headers by default.
- To get zyte-ca.crt, see Installing the Zyte CA certificate
- Install the Zyte CA certificate for HTTPS request support.
- For the code below to work you must first install the Zyte CA certificate.
- Puppeteer requires Node.js and npm installed and an active Smart Proxy Manager account.
- For the code to work you must first install the Zyte CA certificate

- While using Smart Proxy Manager, users might face an issue with short download timeout
  in their web crawlers or scraping applications. This might result in a failed request
  to Smart Proxy Manager. This can be resolved by increasing the download timeout
  value in the application you’re using like Scrapy, 600 seconds is the recommended
  value.
- Even though Smart Proxy Manager should protect you against bans, sometimes it runs
  out of capacity and will return a 503 response. Because of this, we recommend you
  retry 503 responses up to 5 times.
- Zyte API is replacing Smart Proxy Manager. It is no longer possible to sign up to
  Smart Proxy Manager.
- Smart Proxy Manager automatically retries requests from another proxy IP up to 5
  times before generating a 503 status code.
- Responses with 503 codes will not be billed.
- Smart Proxy Manager offers regional IPS to achieve better success rates when accessing
  localized versions.
- Smart Proxy Manager works with data center IPs by default, but it also allow access
  to residential IPs.
- Smart Proxy Manager automatically rotates IPs and retries requests internally when
  it receives a blocked page.
- These mechanics often results in Smart Proxy Manager requests taking several seconds
  to be fulfilled, sometimes above a minute.
- We recommend increasing to 5 minutes (300 seconds) to be safe.
- To fetch HTTPS web pages through Smart Proxy Manager you may need to download and
  install the Zyte CA certificate.
- The header X-Crawlera-Profile:desktop is default even if you make a request with
  it.
- After the Installation you should have Splash and Zyte SmartProxy (formerly Crawlera)
  Headless Proxy both up and running.
- Changes to your billing address only affect future invoices. Existing invoices continue
  to have their original billing address.
- Please note that Cancellation is not immediate and scheduled at the end of billing

- The recent request currently has 14 days history.
- 'You can filter recent requests by Status: Clean/Banned/Failed or All.'
- The report is disabled by default. To enable it, open the Zyte dashboard, select
  Scrapy Cloud → Alerts, and under Smart Proxy Manager Weekly Digest Emails select
  the organizations for which you want to receive the weekly digest. The report will
  be sent on Monday mornings.
- Zyte Smart Proxy Manager is slow on standard web browsers.
- Smart Proxy Manager counts redirects as successful requests.
- Automatic extraction gets you structured data from web data.
- You can only enable 1 of these fields per Zyte API request.
- Extraction of custom attributes uses a Large Language Model (LLM) operated by Zyte.
- Custom Attributes don’t need to be restricted to extract data as it appears on the
  web site verbatim.
- When creating a schema with the extractive method, we recommend to start without
  attribute descriptions.
- Request body size limit is 5MiB.
- For some websites, you might want to set a custom geolocation.
- Response includes various data formats including JSON and HTML.
- Ensure that the filename case matches the URL and any file permissions.
- Root URLs must provide an index.html file.
