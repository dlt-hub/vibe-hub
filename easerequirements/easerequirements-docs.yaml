- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/R4JC/pages/2250506241:
  - 'Authorization requires a JWT token passed in the Authorization header with the
    format "JWT <easeRequirements-api-token>". The token should be obtained from the
    easeRequirements system and included in requests as: Authorization: JWT <token_value>.'
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/R4JC/pages/2250506241/REST+API:
  - JWT token authentication is required. Include the easeRequirements API token in
    the Authorization header as 'JWT <easeRequirements-api-token>'. The token should
    be obtained from the referenced Atlassian documentation page and passed directly
    in the header for all API requests.
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REQ4J/pages/1490616345/REST+API+2.0:
  - The REST API requires authentication through your Jira instance using the same
    methods Jira supports. The preferred authentication methods are OAuth and HTTP
    basic authentication when using SSL.
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REQ4J/pages/68197217/Endpoints:
  - The Requirements for JIRA REST API supports basic HTTP authentication, cookie-based
    authentication, and OAuth authentication, same as standard JIRA. Requests require
    valid user credentials and proper JIRA permissions; invalid credentials return
    401 status and missing permissions return 403 status.
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/T4J/pages/2243493889/REST+API+2.0:
  - To access the REST API, the application must be authenticated by the Jira instance.
    The preferred authentication methods are OAuth and HTTP basic authentication when
    using SSL. The API supports the same authentication methods as Jira itself.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/R4JC/pages/2250506241:
  - Pagination uses query parameters `startAt` (index of first item, optional) and
    `maxResults` (maximum items per page, optional) to control requests. Responses
    include `startAt`, `maxResults`, `total` (total items across all pages, may change),
    and `isLast` (indicates final page); both `total` and `isLast` may not be returned
    for all operations. Continue paginating by incrementing `startAt` by the returned
    `maxResults` value until `isLast` is true.
- information_source; https://easesolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/R4JC/pages/2250506241/REST+API:
  - '`startAt` (query parameter, optional) specifies the index of the first item returned
    in a page. `maxResults` (query parameter, optional) specifies the maximum number
    of items per page; set to a large value to discover the operation''s limit. Response
    includes `total` (total items across all pages, may change), and `isLast` (boolean
    indicating if the page is last); both may not be returned for all operations.
    Increment `startAt` by the returned `maxResults` to request the next page, and
    stop when `isLast` is true.'
