  of the payload.
- Burp Suite to enable BurpTrast integration. The free version is useful because it
  is easy for security staff to use it. Use the paid version if you previously purchased
  it.
- In-house penetration testers or security staff.
- Environments that use the free or paid version of Burp Suite. In most cases, the
  free version of Burp Suite is sufficient because security staff can use it directly.
  If you already purchased, use that version.
- The Contrast Agent Operator is an open-source project.
- Configuration changes are the primary drivers for pod restarts and affect the pod's
  runtime environment.
- Injection of the Node.js agent may result in a substantial increase in the startup
  time of the instrumented application. If startup time is unacceptable, injecting
  the agent during compilation may be desirable. If the application was injected by
  the Node.js agent during compilation then injection during runtime by the operator
  should be disabled.
- Use nodejs for NodeJS LTS >= 18.19.0 and nodejs-legacy for NodeJS LTS < 18.19.0.
- Injection of a PHP application is in beta. Beta status means the feature might change
  or act unexpectedly.
- Ensure to configure API keys in the settings before usage.
- Requires authentication to access data
- Burp Suite to enable BurpTrast integration. The free version is useful because it
  is easy for security staff to use it.
- Use the paid version if you previously purchased it.
- In-house penetration testers or security staff may use this method.
- Environments that use the free or paid version of Burp Suite.
- The default configuration from the YAML file creates ClusterAgentInjectors for the
  ‘default’ namespace.
- If you use other namespaces, you can either label the namespaces with 'agents.contrastsecurity.com/agent-injectors='true''
  or add them to the 'agentInjectors.namespaces' array in the YAML file.
- While the Contrast Agent Operator supports high-availability setups using multiple
  replicas and leader leases, Contrast only supports deployments where all operator
  instances are running the same version for extended periods.
- The option `imagePullPolicy` should not be relied on to keep multiple instances
  on the same version.
- Using an operator, such as Keel, to facilitate safe upgrades is recommended if automatic
  upgrades are desired.
- Use `nodejs` for NodeJS LTS >= 18.19.0 and `nodejs-legacy` for NodeJS LTS < 18.19.0.
- If the YAML file is edited any time after this setup, you will need to repeat all
  of the steps above to get the Operator properly running again.
- API supports retrieving attack events, vulnerabilities, and applications.
- Must use supported versions, frameworks, and tools.
- It is possible to install into a namespace other than the default contrast-agent-operator,
  although modifications to the deployment manifests will be required.
- The option imagePullPolicy should not be relied on to keep multiple instances on
  the same version.
- 'For major upgrades, you must also execute: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/agent-operator/releases/latest/download/crds.yaml.
  This extra step is required because of a limitation in how Helm processes CRDs.'
- While the Contrast Agent Operator supports high availability setups using multiple
  replicas and leader leases, Contrast only supports deployments where all operator
  instances are running the same version for extended periods of time. The option
  imagePullPolicy should not be relied on to keep multiple instances on the same version.
  Using an operator, such as Keel, to facilitate safe upgrades is recommended if automatic
  upgrades are desired.
- The name of the ClusterAgentConnection is not important and can be named anything.
- The operator is now configured and can inject agents into existing workloads.
- Some objects like Vulnerabilities may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This may cause substantial shifting of deployed pods as Kubernetes redeploys impacted
  workloads, depending on how many workloads were injected by the operator. Caution
  is advised in larger clusters.
- After the cluster settles, the operator is safe to remove.
- Future Dynatrace versions may break chaining.
- 'Chaining can introduce incompatibilities and can be disabled using the agent.dotnet.enable_chaining:
  false option.'
- Some API calls may return paginated results
- MAJOR versions may include breaking changes to the operator API.
- MINOR versions contain new features and are fully backwards compatible.
- Patch versions contain security and bug fixes.
- While the Contrast Agent Operator supports high availability setups using multiple
  replicas and leader leases, Contrast only supports deployments where all operator
  instances are running the same version for extended periods of time.
- The AgentInjector needs to be created in the same namespace as the Deployment.
- Any change to the pod's configuration, whether direct or indirect through related
  resources, necessitates a restart to guarantee that the pod reflects the latest
  defined state within the cluster.
- Only the pods affected explicitly by the configuration change will be restarted.
- The memory consumption is typically capped.
- It is essential to understand that only the pods affected explicitly by the configuration
  change will be restarted.
- Ensure to set up the OAuth2 application before accessing the API.
- Ensure proper setup for API access.
- Be aware of API rate limits.
- Supported languages for Contrast include Java, Kotlin, Scala, .NET Framework, .NET
  Core, C#, VB.NET, Node.js, Client-side JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Go, PHP.
- Additional languages for Contrast Scan include SAP ABAP, JavaScript/TypeScript,
  RPG IV, ActionScript, JCL, Swift, ASP.NET, JSP, Transact-SQL, C and C++, NATURAL,
  TypeScript, COBOL, Objective-C, Visual Basic, Hana SQL Script, Oracle Forms, XML,
  HTML, PS-SQL, Informix (SQL and 4GL), PowerScript.
- Create an API-only service user in Contrast with a role that has the View organization
  and Edit application actions.
- Store all sensitive values, such as API keys and authorization keys, as GitHub Secrets.
- SmartFix significantly reduces the manual effort and time that you typically require
  to fix vulnerabilities.
- The tool is designed with developers in mind.
- By using the runtime analysis from Contrast IAST technology (Assess), SmartFix can
  provide more accurate and relevant code fixes.
- OAuth2 requires setup of connected app in Contrast Security
- Some API responses may contain paginated data
- If your organization is using single sign-on (SSO), select the checkbox on the login
  page to disable the password input field.
- If you are using two-step authentication, your login process occurs after successful
  SSO authentication.
- Some API responses may include nested fields.
- Some API calls may have limitations on the number of requests per minute.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in the Contrast
  API
- The Attacks events view is for hosted customers.
- You can choose to stop saving data for attack events with a PROBED result to improve
  performance in the Contrast web interface.
- Ensure proper API keys are configured for each environment
- To use AVM, make sure Contrast Assess is turned on and the server environment is
  set to PRODUCTION.
- This feature is for hosted customers.
- Role-based access control is a preview feature and not available to all customers.
  Contact your Contrast representative to have role-based access control turned on.
- This topic is for on-premises customers.
- The displayed dates on the dashboard for attacks seen are based on the time when
  the Contrast task runs on the server, not your local timezone.
- To stop saving PROBED event data, use this JVM argument in the contrast-server.vmoptions
  file.
