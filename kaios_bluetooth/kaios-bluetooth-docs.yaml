notes:
- App developers who wish to send data to a Bluetooth device can use the share activity.
- The API is currently available for certified and privileged apps only.
- The simulator lets you run Gaia and Web apps in a Gecko-based environment somewhat
  similar to an actual device.
- Doesn't emulate device hardware, so it's not adequate for testing device APIs.
- A simple JSON structure for app manifest is required.
- The manifest must be served from the same origin that the app is served from.
- Manifests can be served over SSL to mitigate certain classes of attacks.
- The manifest should not be cached.
- The manifest must be in UTF-8 encoding in order for the app to be submitted to the
  KaiStore.
- Hosted apps can't be privileged — they must be packaged apps.
- Emulated cursor handled by system is strongly recommended.
- When focusing on an input element (IME is active), app should remember to turn cursor
  off by itself.
- KaiOS needs app developer’s support to follow the guideline below for better user
  experience.
- KaiOS system will block DB writing once remaining data storage size is lower than
  30MB, so each app must do error handling.
- App developer should handle the content carefully and set some limitation especially
  for low storage devices.
- KaiOS provides a preventive action to keep device working normal as usual when storage
  is full by large size of indexedDB.
- The storage type for these IDB is 'temporary' which will be all removed when available
  space is lower than a threshold.
- Packaged Apps are recommended for delivering KaiOS apps.
- Hosted Apps deliver assets on demand from a web server.
- Hosted apps are defined as web apps and cannot use privileged APIs.
- A PWA must be served on HTTPS.
- Service workers require HTTPS for registration.
- Make sure to configure your server to send the manifest file with the right Content-type
- Remember that the .appcache file has to be served as a text/cache-manifest file
- Phaser 2 and 3 versions work well within the KaiOS ecosystem.
- If you want to run your game on both 256MB and 512MB devices, we suggest lowering
  the heap size as much as possible.
- If you are targeting 256MB KaiOS devices, we recommend that you don’t have sound
  files in the app.
- KaiOS 2.5 can ONLY support Construct 2 Runtime and KaiOS 3.0 can ONLY support Construct
  3 Runtime.
- There is a minor bug when the user presses the UP key. The screen will scroll down
  around 2px and a black bar at the bottom.
- 'Banner Image Requirements: JPG format, non alpha, Dimensions: Portrait/Landscape:
  240 x 130 pixels, Maximum file size: 100 KB'
- 'Background Color Requirements: Pick one color with Hex color codes, or choose one
  from below color palettes. The purple is the default option.'
- 'Cursor behaviors are similar to Browser app: Press D-Pad to move the cursor. Press
  CSK to perform mouse click.'
- A hosted app can hide the status bar by setting fullscreen as true.
- By default OS doesn’t show loading progress bar for hosted app. Developers can make
  loading progress bar for a hosted app by themselves, or set loading progress bar
  as true to show OS provided loading progress bar.
- No OS provided software key bar for hosted app. Developers can make it by themselves.
- Shortcut keys are not available in hosted app. Developers can make it by themselves.
- When entering text edit mode, focus on the input and show OS-provided software key
  bar for text inputting.
- When entering full-screen video mode, hide cursor and show OS-provided softkey bar.
- When trying to change pages without internet connection, show this error message
  with 3 buttons.
- App has ability to call vol up/down api to change system volume.
- pattern is required
- timeout must be greater than 10 seconds and less than 3 minutes (default to 30 seconds)
- All Applications must be signed with an KAI-issued certificate in order to be installed
  on KaiOS Devices.
- The QA time is 2-3 business days.
- The KaiStore team reserves the right to reject your app under certain circumstances.
- Applications must comply with the Documentation provided by KAI.
- Licensee must accept and agree to the new Developer Requirements.
- This property can be changed with the BluetoothAdapter.setDiscoverable() method.
- The name of the device's adapter can be changed with the BluetoothAdapter.setName()
  method.
- The discoverable property can be changed with the BluetoothAdapter.setDiscoverable()
  method.
- Provides access to an updated BluetoothGattCharacteristic object.
- Provides Bluetooth GATT server functionality to allow creation of Bluetooth Smart/LE
  services and characteristics.
- Returns a Boolean indicating whether this is a primary or secondary service.
- The value would be null if the device doesn't have any Bluetooth chip.
- 'A status change occurs when one of the following events is triggered: a2dpstatuschange,
  hfpstatuschange, scostatuschange.'
errors:
- Error title and message change according to different errors.
- 'NO_PROVIDER: Device did not install Auth Assistant'
- 'NO_PROVIDER: activity error: NO_PROVIDER'
