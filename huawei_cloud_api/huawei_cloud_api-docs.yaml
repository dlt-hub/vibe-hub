auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/ae-ad-1-api-apig/apig-api-190529268.html:
  - AK/SK-based authentication encrypts the request body using an Access Key and Secret
    Key pair, which is the recommended method for higher security. Alternatively,
    token-based authentication uses a token to authenticate requests. Both methods
    are supported for calling the API.
  - To obtain a user token via the IAM API, send a POST request with a JSON body containing
    auth.identity (with methods set to "password" and user credentials including name,
    password, and domain name) and auth.scope.project (with the project name). Once
    obtained, include the token in subsequent API requests using the X-Auth-Token
    header.

  - Huawei Cloud uses token-based authentication. To obtain a user token, send a POST
    request to the IAM endpoint with a JSON body containing username, domain name,
    password, and project ID in the scope field. The returned token is then used in
    subsequent API requests, typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
- information_source; https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/api-ecs/ecs_01_0011.html:
  - APIs support two authentication methods. First, token-based authentication using
    the X-Auth-Token header with a mandatory user token field. Second, AK/SK authentication
    using SDKs to sign requests, which automatically adds Authorization (signature
    authentication) and X-Sdk-Date headers. For AK/SK, the Authorization header uses
    SDK-HMAC-SHA256 format with Access, SignedHeaders, and Signature components. The
    X-Sdk-Date header contains the request timestamp in format like 20240416T095341Z.
  - 'Huawei Cloud APIs use SDK-HMAC-SHA256 authentication. Requests require three
    headers: Authorization (with Access key, SignedHeaders, and Signature), X-Sdk-Date
    (timestamp in YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ format), and Content-Type set to application/json.
    The Authorization header follows the format "SDK-HMAC-SHA256 Access=<access_key>,
    SignedHeaders=<signed_headers>, Signature=<signature>" where SignedHeaders typically
    includes content-type, host, and x-sdk-date.'

- information_source; https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/api-iam/iam_16_0004.html:
  - The response includes a links object with next and previous fields containing
    resource URLs for pagination navigation. When next is null, there are no additional
    pages to retrieve.
- information_source; https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/eu-west-0-api-apig/apig-en-api-180713204.html:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page_size (optional, default 20, max 500) and
    page_no (required) appended to the URL to control which page of results to retrieve,
    such as GET /v1.0/apigw/apis?page_size=10&page_no=5.
