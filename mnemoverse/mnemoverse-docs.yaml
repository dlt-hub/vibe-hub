  - OAuth implementation uses client_secret for token exchange. The flow involves
    authorization, token acquisition, and then resource access using the obtained
    token.
- information_source; http://mnemoverse.com/docs/architecture/orchestration/implementation/auth-patterns:
  - API key authentication is used for development, scripts, and simple integrations.
    Send the API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with format mnv_dev_[32
    chars] for development, mnv_stg_[32 chars] for staging, or mnv_live_[32 chars]
    for production. The header name is Authorization and the value format is Bearer
    mnv_{environment}_{random_chars}.
