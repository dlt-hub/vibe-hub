notes:
- API supports various endpoints for retrieving rates, currencies, and wallets.
- Each API call must be accompanied by an API Token which grants access to the requested
  capability.
- API calls using the merchant facade must be cryptographically signed.
- Transactions must be over $1 USD.
- Create an API token from your BitPay merchant dashboard
- Require Authentication is unchecked when creating the token
- The minimum invoice amount is $1 USD.
- BitPay maintains server-side API libraries in various programming languages which
  are available via popular package managers.
- BitPay strongly advises using a secrets manager or other encryption mechanism such
  as Mozilla SOPS.
- Settlement payments for BitPay merchants happen automatically, every business day.
- BitPay protects merchants on our platform by maintaining enterprise-level legal
  and compliance standards.
- Invoices expire after 15 minutes by default.
- BitPay's API has a unique protocol called Bitauth.
- BitPay uses webhooks for notifications regarding invoice and refund status.
- BitPay requires a one-time compliance check for individuals before they can interact
  with certain BitPay services.
- Make sure your account name reflects the name of your entity.
- Proper marketing is critical to the success of your partnership with BitPay.
- Achieving benefits requires a customer base that is well aware of your acceptance
  of BitPay as a payment option.
- All development and testing should occur in BitPay's test environment before switching
  to product endpoints.
- Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible once 'Complete' so caution should be
  exercised when securing applications.
- BitPay provides Instant Payment Notifications so API polling is not required nor
  is it advised.
- BitPay invoice requires buyer's email for refund processing.
- A merchant is restricted to creating no more than 100 invoices per hour.
- The response to a create invoice request and the response to a get invoice request
  are all identical JSON representations of the invoice object.
- Be sure that you have also set the redirectURL when generating the invoice, which
  will ensure that the user gets redirected to the appropriate confirmation page following
  payment.
- IPNs are sent to the notificationURL provided by merchants when creating the invoice.
- BitPay does not sign IPNs, so the information in the payload should not be trusted
  outright.
- It is important for merchants to wait until a payment is marked as 'Complete' before
  transferring ownership of goods or delivering services to the customer.
- If goods or services are delivered before the payment is marked as 'Complete', there
  is a risk that the payment may be invalid or cancelled.
- Payouts can be initiated for recipients of any status.
- You can manually create payouts using the BitPay merchant dashboard.
- If your account is charged a flat fee on each transaction, it is always calculated
  in USD, typically measured in cents.
- Simply adding the fee (2%+25¢) to an invoice will not cover the fee entirely, as
  increasing the invoice also increases the fee collected.
- Your BitPay ledger must hold funds in excess of the refund amount before you can
  create the refund request.
- Blockchain payments were made for online transactions.
- A 200 return code means that the transaction is valid.
- 400 Read a detailed problem description from the http error stream.
- Use the Test Environment to implement the BitPay payment method on your website
  and perform end-to-end transactions with testnet coins. Once the implementation
  is completed, go live with the production URLs and API credentials.
- Pairing codes will expire after 24 hours, however once a token is approved or claimed
  the expiration is cleared.
- For e-commerce implementation, we advise merchants to generate a standard pos facade
  token directly from the BitPay dashboard (make sure 'Require Authentication' is
  disabled) and use the 'Tokens' API endpoint only to request higher privilege tokens
  (typically merchant facade). Merchants only need to use this endpoint once, depending
  on the number of facades they want to have access to.
- Merchants need to save the API tokens generated with the POST /tokens and not have
  an automatic call to this endpoint to retrieve approved API tokens prior to other
  calls, like creating an invoice.
- Invoice status can be 'new', 'paid', 'confirmed', 'complete', 'expired', 'invalid',
  'declined'.
- The miner fees are detailed per currency type.
- The shopper object will only be available if the shopper signs in using BitPay ID.
- Updating an invoice will require EITHER an SMS or E-mail.
- HVT invoices cannot have their contact information updated after it is initially
  set.
- Cancellation will require EITHER an SMS or E-mail to have already been set if the
  invoice has proceeded to the point where it may have been paid, unless using forceCancel
  parameter.
- Invoices will require buyer contact information, either an Email (recommended) or
  SMS, to be refunded.
- On confirmed invoices, the refund is worked out between BitPay and buyer as no funds
  have been credited to merchant ledger.
- Refund is already processing.
- Refund was performed on a confirmed invoice.
- For merchants who need to invite multiple recipients in a short period of time,
  make sure to send batch of invites e.g. use this endpoint to invite an array []
  of recipients (up to 1000 in a single API call)
- By default a merchant can invite a maximum of 1000 distinct recipients via the business
  account. Reach out to your account manager at BitPay in order to increase this limit.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The X-Identity header is optional for this endpoint when using the public facade,
  and required when using a merchant facade token.
- The X-Signature header is optional for this endpoint when using the public facade,
  and required when using a merchant facade token.
- Ensure to handle OAuth2 setup correctly.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires initial setup with BitPay
- Some endpoints may have specific permissions required
- Uses webhook notifications for payout status changes.
- Requires API key for access
- Rate limiting applies
- OAuth2 authentication required for all endpoints
- The id of the payout you want to retrieve is required as a path parameter.
- Defaults to 0 for amount in response data
- Must set Content-Type to application/json for requests to the BitPay API
- Must set X-Accept-Version to 2.0.0 for requests to the BitPay API
- X-Accept-Version must be set to 2.0.0 for requests to the BitPay API
- X-Identity header is required when using a merchant facade token.
- X-Signature header is required when using a merchant facade token.
- API sessions are an optional feature of our API which can be utilized to provide
  even greater security and reliability.
- An API session can be created by issuing a POST to /sessions.
- The BitPay server expects an HTTP 200 response with an empty body for IPNs.
- 'BitPay strongly advise merchants to use instead the extended format for the invoice
  resource by passing the parameter "extendedNotifications": true in the body of the
  invoice request.'
- This is the recommended IPN format that BitPay advises for all new implementations.
- 'Webhook notification codes: 1003 - invoice_paidInFull, 1004 - invoice_expired,
  1005 - invoice_confirmed, 1006 - invoice_completed, 1012 - invoice_manuallyNotified,
  1013 - invoice_failedToConfirm, 1016 - invoice_refundComplete, 1019 - invoice_declined'
- Fields containing * are only sent on webhooks that occur AFTER refund_created
- Webhook notifications for recipient events include various codes indicating the
  status of the recipient.
- Webhook notifications are sent for payout events.
- Webhook notification codes available for various invoice events
- Webhooks now carry a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) header called
  `x-signature`, which contains a base64 SHA256 hash that can be used to verify the
  validity of webhooks.
- Webhooks are sent to the `notificationURL` of the resource.
- The examples below are simplified to show the logic for verifying a webhook.
- The BitPay payout service is only API based. Merchants will need to build their
  own implementation as there are currently no dashboard functionalities to submit
  payout requests.
- Merchants will need to keep an operational reserve on their BitPay account to ensure
  the batches are executed on the same day they are requested.
- This setup is required for using the merchant and payout facades.
- You can skip this section if If you will only be using the pos facade.
- It is not recommended to transmit the private key over any public or unsecure networks.
- You must have a BitPay merchant account to use this SDK. It's free to sign-up for
  a BitPay merchant account.
- The private key should be stored securely and not transmitted over unsecure networks.
- The pairing code is entered into the BitPay merchant dashboard for activation.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in bitpay
- You can add optional attributes to the invoice. Attributes that are not set are
  ignored or given default values.
- Requires a valid token for access.
- Always use the included InvoiceStatus model to avoid typos
- Updating the invoice will require EITHER an SMS or E-mail, but not both.
- smsCode required only when verifying SMS.
- Email address is mandatory for creating a bill
- HTTPS is mandatory for notificationURL
- BitPay does not sign webhooks, so the information in the payload should never be
  trusted outright
- Merchants must use HTTPS for the notificationURL
- The minimum amount per instruction is $5 USD equivalent.
- HTTPS is mandatory for the notification URL.
- HTTP response includes fields such as id, recipientId, shopperId, amount, currency,
  and status.
- It is very important that merchants implement this endpoint as it is the only way
  for them to cancel a batch prior to execution. Once a payout has been executed,
  the funds cannot be recovered.
- Refund lifecycle status includes preview, created, pending, cancelled, success,
  and failure.
- No special parameters, if successful will return refund request with updated status
  ('cancelled')
- This page is for the Java SDK version 9.0.0 or higher. Earlier versions had a slightly
  different client instantiation process.
- Each client paired with the BitPay server requires a ECDSA key.
- The private key should be stored in the client environment such that it cannot be
  compromised.
- The private key should be stored securely and not transmitted over insecure networks.
- In this example, we assume that a Client has already been initialized and assigned
  to the `bitpay` variable.
- autoVerify is only available in Sandbox environment.
- Cancellation will require either an SMS or E-mail to have already been set if the
  invoice has proceeded to the point where it may have been paid.
- PayInvoice is only available in the test environment.
- Webhooks are not signed, payload information should not be trusted outright.
- Merchants must use HTTPS for the notificationURL.
- It is very important that merchants implement this endpoint as it is the only way
  for them to cancel a payout prior to execution. Once a payout has been executed,
  the funds cannot be recovered.
- BitPay does not sign webhooks, so the information in the payload should never be
  trusted outright.
- Requires an ECDSA key for client interaction with the BitPay server
- Private key should be stored securely and not transmitted over public networks
- 'If you get the following error when initiating the client for first time: ''500
  Internal Server Error'' response: {"error":"Account not setup completely yet."}
  Please, go back to your BitPay account and complete the required steps.'
- An aged list of invoices can be retrieved using method parameters that map to URL
  parameters on the API.
- Creates a new refund request.
- This API allows updating and retrieving refunds by their GUID.
- Allows a merchant to invite clients to sign up for a BitPay personal account.
- Updates a bill.
- If your private key is compromised you should revoke the compromised client identity
  from the BitPay server and re-pair your client.
- 'If you get the following error when initiating the client for first time: 500 Internal
  Server Error, {''error'':''Account not setup completely yet.''}. Please, go back
  to your BitPay account and complete the required steps.'
- It is very important that merchants implement this endpoint as it is the only way
  for them to cancel a payout prior to execution.
