  - 'Authentication uses a session-based approach. First, call the authentication/getServerDefinition
    endpoint with userName and password to get your data center URL. Then call authentication/login
    on that server with the same credentials to receive a sessionId. For all subsequent
    requests, pass the sessionId in the Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    Session {sessionId}". The API also supports API Keys as an alternative authentication
    method.'
  - REST API access is enabled for all Enterprise organizations and does not require
    a special key to access the API. Certified partners can request a partner ID to
    access the API for Professional edition organizations. The base URL for all REST
    API calls is https://api.clarizen.com/v2.0/services/ with core services including
    Authentication, Metadata, Data and Bulk. Requests and responses use JSON format,
    and compression is supported with the Accept-Encoding gzip header.
  - 'The API uses session-based authentication. First, call the Authentication service
    to determine your organization''s data center and perform a login operation to
    receive a Session ID. Include the Session ID in the Authorization header with
    "Session" prefix format (Authorization: Session <session_id>) on all subsequent
    requests. API Keys are also supported; see the API Keys Support documentation
    for details.'
