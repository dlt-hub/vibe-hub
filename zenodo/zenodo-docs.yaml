auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.zenodo.org/:
  - 'All API access requires an access token passed in the Authorization header using
    Bearer token scheme. Create a token at https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
    and include it as Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN} in request headers.'
  - All API requests require OAuth 2.0 authentication over HTTPS. Authentication is
    done by including a personal access token either as an HTTP Authorization header
    using Bearer scheme or as a URL query parameter named access_token. The token
    must be created in your Zenodo account settings and scoped with appropriate permissions
    such as deposit:write for write access to depositions or deposit:actions for publishing
    and editing operations.
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" when making requests to upload files. The token
    should be passed as an environment variable or obtained from the API provider
    and included in the headers dictionary with key "Authorization".
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" where $ACCESS_TOKEN is your access
    token obtained from Zenodo. This token is required for all API requests to deposit
    and upload files.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. The ACCESS_TOKEN
    must be included as "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" in request headers. The
    operation requires the "deposit:write" scope.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.zenodo.org/:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (page number) and size (results
    per page). Response is an array of deposition resources. Stop pagination when
    the array is empty or fewer results than size are returned.'
  - The `/api/licenses/` endpoint uses optional query parameters `page` (integer,
    page number) and `size` (integer, results per page) for pagination. The response
    returns an array of license resources, but no explicit pagination metadata fields
    or navigation instructions are documented.
- information_source; http://developers.zenodo.org:
  - The API uses optional query parameters `page` (page number) and `size` (results
    per page) for pagination. The success response returns an array of deposition
    resources. Stop paginating when the response array is empty or contains fewer
    results than the requested page size.
  - 'The `/api/licenses/` endpoint uses offset-based pagination with optional query
    parameters: `page` (integer, optional, page number) and `size` (integer, optional,
    results per page). The response returns an array of license resources; response
    fields indicating pagination state or next page navigation are not documented.'
- information_source; http://developers.zenodo.org/:
  - The List endpoint uses query parameter pagination with `page` (optional, page
    number) and `size` (optional, results per page). The response is an array of license
    resources; no explicit next/previous fields or stopping conditions are documented.
