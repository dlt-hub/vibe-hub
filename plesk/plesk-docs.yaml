- Plesk only supports LTS (Long-Term Support) releases of MariaDB.
- The latest TLS release is version 11.8, which is supported by Plesk.
- One issue with the SSL extension persists through all versions. I brought this up
  since years, but never put it into a bug report. But it is clearly a bug.
- 'Previously, one argued that when you turn on ''keep websites secured'', this leads
  to this behavior. But: Once an SSL certificate is removed, it is not possible to
  turn that setting off. It needs to be turned off automatically when an SSL certificate
  is removed.'
- One issue with the SSL extension persists through all versions.

- SELinux is disabled on AlmaLinux 10.

  and it will not be valid for later versions like 18.0.59+).
- In Plesk, Mailman3 web UI was not tested yet.

  work correctly, it is known limitation for now.
- Backups are not supported yet, it is known limitation for now.

  are known limitations of implementation for now (as well as supporting mailman3

- Dist-upgrade in Plesk does not support updating/migration from mailman2 to mailman3.
- Mailman3 has limited built-in support for HTTPS certificates and ARC headers.
- Current set of limitations for mailman3 is the same as it was in the past for mailman2.
