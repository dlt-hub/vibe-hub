auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.weaveapi.com:
  - 'The Weave API uses header-based authentication with two required headers: X-WEAVE-APIKEY
    for the Weave API access token, and X-WEAVE-PROXY-ACCESS-TOKEN for the proxied
    PMS/OTA access token. Additionally, X-WEAVE-PROXY-DESTINATION header specifies
    which PMS/OTA system to proxy requests to (e.g., hostaway).'
- information_source; https://docs.weaveapi.com/:
  - The Weave API requires SSL connections and uses header-based authentication. Requests
    must include the X-WEAVE-APIKEY header with your Weave API access token. For proxied
    requests to integrated PMS/OTA systems, also include X-WEAVE-PROXY-DESTINATION
    (the system name like "hostaway") and X-WEAVE-PROXY-ACCESS-TOKEN (the access token
    for that system).
