auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.skritter.com/api/v0/docs/authentication:
  - Authorization code OAuth2 flow is used. The access token is obtained from the
    response JSON and should be kept secure on the server side only. Client secret
    must be protected and not exposed to user devices. Use authorization code grant
    to keep the access token server-side. If handling user passwords to obtain tokens,
    remove them from your system immediately after token acquisition and refresh as
    needed.
  - 'OAuth2 authentication with multiple grant types. Send grant_type (required, one
    of: ''authorization_code'', ''refresh_token'', ''password'', ''client_credentials''),
    client_id (required), and client_secret (required for ''password'' grant type,
    optional for others; send via POST parameter or HTTP header). For ''authorization_code''
    grant type, also send redirect_uri and code. For ''refresh_token'' grant type,
    send refresh_token. For ''password'' grant type, send username and always provide
    client_secret via HTTP header. POST to http://legacy.skritter.com/api/v0/oauth2/token.
    Response includes access_token, token_type (always ''bearer''), state (if provided
    in request), and user_id.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used for websites. Redirect users to https://legacy.skritter.com/api/v0/oauth2/authorize,
    then exchange the returned authorization code for an access token by POSTing to
    https://legacy.skritter.com/api/v0/oauth2/token with grant_type set to 'authorization_code',
    client_id (OAUTH_CLIENT_NAME), client_secret (OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET from https://www.skritter.com/api/client/home),
    redirect_uri (must match the initial redirect), and code (the authorization code
    from the callback). The response contains an access_token field.
  - 'OAuth2 token-based authentication with multiple grant types. Clients obtain access
    tokens via POST to /token endpoint using grant_type parameter (password, refresh_token,
    or client_credentials). Username and password are required for password grant
    type. Client credentials (client-name and client-secret) must be provided either
    as POST parameters or Base64-encoded in HTTP Authorization header with format
    "basic: base64(client-name:client-secret)". Response includes access_token (bearer
    type), refresh_token, expires_in (seconds), and token_type. Use the access_token
    in subsequent API requests to fetch results.'
  - 'Skritter uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Clients obtain tokens through
    one of three methods: OAuth2 redirect flow (user redirected back with token),
    password grant flow (submit user credentials directly to Skritter), or client
    credentials flow (no specific user authorization). Once obtained, include the
    token as the "bearer_token" parameter in requests or in an HTTP header. Tokens
    should be refreshed periodically to maintain active authentication.'
