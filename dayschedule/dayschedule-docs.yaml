    Exchange the returned authorization code for a Bearer token by POSTing to https://api.dayschedule.com/v1/oauth2/token
    with Content-Type application/json and JSON body containing grant_type=authorization_code,
    code, client_id, and client_secret. Use the Bearer token in subsequent API requests.

    token, send a POST request with grant_type set to authorization_code, along with
    code, client_id, and client_secret in the JSON body. The response includes an
    access_token with token_type Bearer that expires in 3600 seconds. When expired,

    with grant_type set to refresh_token, client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token
    in the JSON body. Use the returned access_token in subsequent API requests as
