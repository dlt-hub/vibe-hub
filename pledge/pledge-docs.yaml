notes:
- Pledge sends a header named Pledge-Signature along with webhooks, which allows you
  to verify that the webhook event is coming from us.
- Do not embed our widgets in an iframe directly. The embed script is crucial for
  your page and our widgets to communicate.
- Requires setup of partner key for embedding donation forms
