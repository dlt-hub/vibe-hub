pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dragonsdata.com/how-to-automate-power-bi-work/:
  - Use $top=5000 and $skip=5000 query parameters to paginate through results. For
    example, $top=5000 limits results to 5000 per request, and $skip=5000 skips the
    first 5000 records. Increment $skip by 5000 in each subsequent request to retrieve
    additional pages until fewer than 5000 results are returned.
