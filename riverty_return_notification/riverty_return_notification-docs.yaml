auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.riverty.com/back_in_flow/getting_started/authentication:
  - The API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication. Send a POST request
    to the Auth0 token endpoint with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, client_secret,
    and audience parameters in the request body (application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    format). The response includes an access_token with token_type Bearer and expires_in
    of 86400 seconds. Use the access_token in subsequent API requests as a Bearer
    token in the Authorization header.
- information_source; https://docs.riverty.com/bnpl/documentation/api_authentication:
  - Each merchant receives a dedicated X-Auth-Key per webshop and per country that
    must be included with all API requests. The X-Auth-Key header is required for
    authentication and should be sent with every request, including the GetVersion
    endpoint used for testing authentication setup.
