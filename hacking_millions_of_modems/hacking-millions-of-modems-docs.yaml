notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Cox
- Potential vulnerabilities in TR-069 protocol for managing devices
- The API has extensive device management functionality.
- Static resources may trigger routing issues due to proxy rules.
- Intermittent authorization errors observed when replaying requests.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- API calls to update device configuration worked.
- An attacker could have accessed this API to overwrite configuration settings.
- This API does not require authentication.
- The production environment uses Cloudflare Zero Trust.
- API provides vehicle control features remotely.
- The API allows updating device settings without proper authentication.
- Findings document vulnerabilities in automotive APIs and telematics systems.
- The API key is required for authentication.
- Some API endpoints may leak sensitive information.
- Session token required for accessing dealer APIs
- Endpoints may require specific headers for vehicle access
- Authorization token can be leaked using only a surname and rewards number.
- The API allows directory traversal vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access
  to customer order records.
- Certain endpoints may expose sensitive customer data.
- API key is required for authentication.
- Uses Flask session cookies for authentication
- Administration panel built for points.com employees to manage rewards programs at
  the tenant level
- Multiple vulnerabilities found across automotive APIs leading to account takeover
  and data exposure.
- Authorization tokens can be leaked using only surname and rewards number.
- Multiple vulnerabilities reported have been remediated.
- The API can return sensitive customer data if exploited.
- Administration panel built for points.com employees to manage rewards programs at
  the tenant level.
- An attacker with access could revoke the credentials used by airlines to provide
  service, shutting down global rewards travel.
- The vulnerability was fixed on August 26th, 2022.
- The findings summarize vulnerabilities identified in various automotive companies.
- Authentication may allow access to sensitive internal resources.
- Allows external HTTP requests as an intended functionality
- Exposed route on the site which would proxy and try to optimize all images
- Mail service hosted on www.icloud.com alongside other services.
- No server side processing of emails for content sanitation.
- Apple has had an interesting history working with security researchers, but it appears
  that their vulnerability disclosure program is a massive step in the right direction
  to working with hackers in securing assets and allowing those interested to find
  and report vulnerabilities.
- Authentication bypass discovered in multiple applications
- Vulnerabilities included SQL injection and remote code execution
- The internal API had an exposed Microsoft Graph instance which would've allowed
  an attacker to exfiltrate nearly 100 million user records.
- The mail application is hosted on www.icloud.com alongside all other services.
- The service allows for interaction with a JSON blob processed by JavaScript.
- Multiple endpoints are vulnerable to IDOR attacks.
- Some endpoints expose sensitive metadata about support cases.
- Apple was very responsive to our reports. The turn around for our more critical
  reports was only four hours between time of submission and time of remediation.
- Apple does payments in batches and will likely pay for more of the issues in the
  following months.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Tesla
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ASP.NET can't access source files? Read from /bin/className.dll.
- Want to see some awesome secrets? Read from web.config.
- The application had limited interaction and specific functionalities.
- 'This isn''t something Valve normally pays for. The reason for receiving a bounty
  is as follows: ''Thanks for the report. While this report doesn''t involve assets
  we have control over we have taken action on the effected user accounts so they
  suffer as little harm as possible. Normally a report on something we don''t control
  would not be eligible for a bounty, but in this case the level of detail in the
  report warrants a payout.'''
- If the directory exists then you'll be redirected to a login portal.
- The login portal may have a 'Sign up' button.
- The API does not require authentication.
- The API allows directory traversal, which can lead to exposing sensitive information.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Tesla API
- Some endpoints may return data specific to vehicle ID
- Requires setup of connected app in Yahoo Small Business
- The endpoint for invoices is exploitable via directory traversal.
- The unique user ID is tied to the victims account.
- The unique user ID can be paired with the 'password reset' function to create new
  passwords.
- Permanent account takeover on Yahoo's Small Business platform
- File getImg.php requires multiple HTTP GET parameters to return content.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Yahoo
