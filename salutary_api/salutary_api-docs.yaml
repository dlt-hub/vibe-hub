  - Bearer Token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" for API requests.
  - Most API requests require Bearer Token authentication sent in the Authorization
    header. Tokens have a 30-minute lifetime and can be refreshed using POST /user/refresh_token.
    For higher rate limits and longer token lifetime, use an automation token instead
    of the regular token.

  - OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required. Obtain an access_token by POSTing
    to /auth/connect/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, including
    client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to vendor_data_access, username, integration_group_id,
    and scope (must include openid plus API scopes like ApplicantApi, RatingApi, QAS,
    Data_Enrichment_Auto). Send the returned access_token in the Authorization header
    as a bearer token for all subsequent requests. Tokens expire and require re-authentication
    when a 401 Unauthorized is received.
  - This API uses OAuth2 with a custom grant type for authentication. To obtain an
    access token, POST to {{url}}/auth/connect/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
    including client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "vendor_data_access", scope
    (space-separated values like "ApplicantApi RatingApi openid QAS"), username, and
    integration_group_id. The response contains access_token (use as Bearer token
    in Authorization header), expires_in (3600 seconds), token_type ("Bearer"), and
    scope. Available scopes include ApplicantApi, RatingApi, openid, QAS, and Data_Enrichment_Auto.
