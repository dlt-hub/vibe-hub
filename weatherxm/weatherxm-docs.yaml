auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.weatherxm.com/api/v1/docs/openapi.json:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all protected endpoints.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    using the "Bearer" scheme. The security requirement is specified as "bearerAuth"
    with an empty scope array, indicating a simple bearer token without additional
    scopes.
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests marked with the bearerAuth
    security scheme. A 401 Unauthorized response indicates missing or invalid credentials.'
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header for requests to protected endpoints. The security scheme is named "bearerAuth"
    and is required for operations like creating presigned metadata and deleting photos.
  - The WeatherXM API uses a login-based authentication flow where users submit credentials
    to the /api/v1/auth/login endpoint and receive access tokens in the response.
    The access tokens are then used in subsequent requests to authenticate, likely
    via the Authorization header with a Bearer token scheme.
