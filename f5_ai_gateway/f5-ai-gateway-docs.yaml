notes:
- A few notable OpenAI features which are not yet supported include streaming, tool
  calling, and multi-modal input/output; only Text.
- AI Gateway is deployed on Kubernetes.
- We recommend using NGINX Ingress Controller in front of AI Gateway to expose it
  to your clients.
- Services like OpenAI require an API key.
- Use a Kubernetes secret to store the OpenAI API key.
