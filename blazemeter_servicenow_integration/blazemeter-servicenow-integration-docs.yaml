notes:
- The integration is complete. Remember to adjust the Advanced Webhooks thresholds
  so alerts are only sent when you want them to.
- Functional tests don’t run on Private Locations that have more than one agent. To
  run Functional tests, ensure you have only a single agent assigned.
- By default, video recording is enabled.
- You can run tests from the cloud or from behind your firewall against any public
  or private API.
- JMeter Properties can be used to parameterize your test.
- One version of your script can then be used in several different test configurations.
- JMeter properties also allow you to make mid-test changes to script behavior.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Use only anonymized or synthetic data for testing.
- Don't use production data in your tests, or anything that contains confidential
  information or personally identifiable information (PII).
- Think Time option introduces a delay that can be used as a factor to simulate slow
  human responses or network latency.
- Advanced webhooks are a team-level feature.
- Contact BlazeMeter Support to enable advanced webhooks for your team.
- 'On a free plan, only the following locations are available: US California, Hong
  Kong, Japan, Brazil, India, US Iowa, Finland, and US South Carolina.'
- Tests can be scheduled to run on frequencies up to every minute.
- You can create up to 10 schedules per test.
- Use of the agent requires a trial or paid subscription.
- The API Monitoring feature typically requires a token be associated with an application
  for general use cases.
- Local client authentication configuration options will only be used if there is
  no client authentication enabled on the environment or request.
