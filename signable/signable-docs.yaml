auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.signable.app/_bundle/openapi.json?download:
  - API keys are used for authentication. Include the API key in the `Authorization`
    header as a bearer token, or pass it as the `company_api_key` or `api_key` parameter
    in requests. The key is returned in API responses and should be stored securely
    for subsequent API calls.
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required for all API requests. Credentials must
    be sent in the Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
    where credentials are username:password encoded in base64.'
- information_source; https://developers.signable.app/openapi/templates:
  - Basic authentication is required for this endpoint. Send credentials using HTTP
    Basic Auth with username and password in the format -u <username>:<password> in
    the Authorization header (automatically handled by curl -u flag or equivalent
    in other HTTP clients).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.signable.app/_bundle/openapi.json?download:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. The response includes offset (index
    of first result), limit (number of results per page), and total_envelopes (total
    count). Use offset and limit as query parameters to navigate pages; increment
    offset by limit to get the next page until offset plus limit exceeds total_envelopes.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter (integer,
    example 10) controls page size. The response includes total_webhooks (total count)
    and next (URI for the next page with offset and limit parameters). Continue paginating
    by following the next URI until it is no longer present.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes offset,
    limit, total_webhooks fields, and a next URL for retrieving subsequent pages.
    Continue paginating while the next field is present in the response.
- information_source; https://developers.signable.app/openapi/templates:
  - The endpoint uses offset and limit query parameters for pagination. offset is
    an integer starting at 0 (default 0) specifying the first result index, and limit
    is an integer between 1 and 50 (default 10) specifying maximum results per request.
    The response includes offset and limit fields. Requesting more than 50 results
    returns 10 instead.
