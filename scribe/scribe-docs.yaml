notes:
- Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel codebase.
- PHP 8.1 and Laravel 9 or higher are required.
- The .scribe folder contains intermediate output—information about your API that
  Scribe has extracted.
- Scribe regenerates the .scribe folder on every run, while preserving any changes
  you've made to endpoints or Markdown files.
- 'Scribe uses the auth information you specify for four things: generating an ''Authentication''
  section in your docs, adding auth information to the Postman collection and OpenAPI
  spec, adding authentication parameters to your example requests for endpoints that
  use authentication, and adding the necessary auth parameters with the specified
  value to response calls for endpoints that use authentication.'
- You can edit the contents of Camel files to override Scribe and pass in external
  information.
- To discard changes, run `scribe:generate --force`.
