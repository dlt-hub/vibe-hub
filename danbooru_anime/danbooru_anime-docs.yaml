auth_info:
- information_source; https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:api:
  - The Danbooru API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. You must pass your login and
    API key using the -u flag in curl (or equivalent in your HTTP client), formatted
    as login:api_key. This applies to all state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)
    and any requests that require authentication. The credentials are sent in the
    Authorization header as base64-encoded "login:api_key".
