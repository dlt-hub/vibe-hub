notes:
- Developers can store OAuth application keys centrally in a Token Store database
  as well as the so called end points of services.
- If 'Save my credentials and keep me signed in across sessions' is checked, no login
  page will appear again in future sessions.
- The sample application demonstrates several scenarios and benefits of reactive applications.
- Agents can share tool calling details with other agents using Agent Connect events.
- Agents can stream their intermediate thinking steps.
- Uses REST API for creating articles and Kafka for messaging
- Asynchronous messaging provides better user experience
- User authentication and secure traffic
- The watsonx.ai as a Service API requires a bearer token which needs to be refreshed
  every hour. You can get it via API key.
- AI services offer a secure solution to deploy your code functions. Credentials such
  as bearer tokens that are required for authentication are generated from task credentials
  by the service.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
