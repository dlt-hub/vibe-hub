notes:
- API keys with a sensible ACL can provide enough security without adding too much
  overhead.
- Client-side apps should connect to the cloud search engine directly for performance
  reasons.
- A well-thought-out data strategy for faceting ensures effective filtering and high-speed
  performance.
- Uses JSON for flexible data representation.
- Facets are crucial for creating a quality search experience.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 'Pagination is zero-based: the first page is page: 0.'
- All requests must use HTTPS.
- Access to the A/B Testing API is available as part of the Premium or Elevate plans.
- 'Required ACL: addObject, deleteIndex, editSettings'
- Access to the Infrastructure endpoints is available as part of the Premium or Elevate
  plans.
- 'Required ACL: search'
