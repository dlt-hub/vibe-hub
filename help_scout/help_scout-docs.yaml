  explain the specific error and pinpoint wrong query parameters it is not always
  possible. Please check documentation for the endpoint you were calling.'

  doesn’t conform to the endpoint’s specification - number is used instead of object

  of values, separated by comma. The error message provides a list of the allowed
  values.'
- 'Rejected request: The request was rejected because the URI did not conform to the
  rules. Please consult the documentation for the particular endpoint.'
- 'Cannot Run Workflow: Only manual workflows can be executed via the API and all
  conversation IDs must belong to existing conversations from the workflow’s inbox.'
