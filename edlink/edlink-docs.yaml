notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Edlink's onboarding flow is simple, taking less than 5 minutes for most setups.
- Edlink is a technology company first. Our product is our API and we have put a lot
  of effort into designing it to be clear and easy to implement.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- All systems operational with 100% uptime over the past 90 days
- Out of the box support for LTI, Clever, and Classlink.
- Edlink can handle complex SSO requirements from districts.
- OAuth2 authentication required for access.
- Data may vary based on the permissions set for the authenticated user.
- Requires setup of connected app in Edlink
- Eliminate copy and pasting. Sync coursework and grades directly to the LMS or SIS.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Deliver better student experiences and save teachers tons of manual effort by syncing
  coursework and grades directly to the LMS or SIS.
- Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using advanced standards like AES-256.
- Meets SOC 2 standards and international regulations.
- Links for partners to get more information on how we can work better together.
- Edlink API requires OAuth2 authentication
- We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose
  other than to provide the services on the School's behalf.
- We do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes and we will never share
  or sell Student Data with third parties for marketing purposes.
- Edlink extracts data from a school's data platform on a regular basis. By default
  updates occur multiple times per day, although the schedule can be tailored to the
  schools requirements.
- Edlink only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances.
- Schools are responsible for determining whether data is ever shared with applications
  through Edlink.
- Edlink retains data backups for 7 days, and retains audit logs for up to 30 days.
- Schools can revoke access to a third-party with immediate effect.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Edlink
- API endpoints for accessing LMS files are new and under development.
- Rubrics support will be added before the back-to-school season.
- Uses OAuth 2.0
- Edlink connects your product to trusted authentication providers like Google, Microsoft,
  Clever, and ClassLink.
- API supports OAuth2 authentication.
- Requires setup of connected app in Schoology
- Some objects may return nulls in certain fields
- Some endpoints may require additional permissions.
- Rate limits apply to API usage.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of application in Schoology
- Some endpoints may return paginated data
- Developers integrating with Infinite Campus must understand OneRoster 1.1, 1.2,
  OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, and JSON.
- Scaling integrations across institutions means understanding multiple OneRoster
  versions.
- The user will have to signed in via Edlink at least once before.
- Most developers will have to work within the constraints of OneRoster - the only
  integration option that doesn’t require a commitment.
- Scaling integrations requires adapting to different versions and requirements.
- The widget uses a cookie that is set during the SSO process.
- Always implement proper error handling in the onError callback or via events to
  provide feedback to users when something goes wrong.
- Call destroy() when the onboarding component is no longer needed to prevent memory
  leaks.
- The Authentication plugin supports any SSO provider in Edlink.
- The Assignment Builder plugin will only work with systems that Edlink can create/modify
  assignments in.
- Schools may use the Services to authorize you and other third-party Developers to
  securely access Student Data.
- Edlink abstracts complexities and inconsistencies inherent in different educational
  platforms.
- Not all SIS platforms support grade passback, and not all LMS platforms expose detailed
  attendance data.
- You may designate one or more third-party Developers to securely access or modify
  Student Data via our API.
- SOC 2 compliant
- Aligns with GDPR and FERPA
- Edlink is SOC-2 compliant, which means we follow strict controls to keep your data
  secure, available, and confidential.
- We use AES-256 encryption—the gold standard—for all data, whether it's at rest or
  in transit.
- Ensure your application layout accommodates the onboarding modal appropriately.
- Consider pre-filling the email field when the user's information is already known
  to reduce friction.
- Only specify a provider parameter when you want to skip the provider selection screen
  and direct users to a specific integration.
- Use the theme option to match the onboarding flow to your brand colors for a consistent
  user experience.
- You authorize us to access Student Data and will provide a way for us to access
  the information stored in your SIS, LMS, or other Data Source.
