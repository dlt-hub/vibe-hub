auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.open-xchange.com/7.10.5/middleware/:
  - OAuth 2.0 is supported as an authorization mechanism. The OX App Suite can act
    as an OAuth 2.0 provider (since v7.8.0) and also supports external authorization
    servers that issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or opaque access tokens. OAuth 2.0 provider
    functionality is enabled via the `com.openexchange.oauth.provider.enabled` property,
    and the provider mode is configured through `com.openexchange.oauth.provider.mode`.
    Specific endpoints and required permission scopes for OAuth-protected API calls
    are documented in the current API documentation. External Identity & Access management
    systems like Keycloak are supported for token validation.
- information_source; https://documentation.open-xchange.com/8/middleware/calendar/iTip.html:
  - Authentication is done via basic auth, as configured via the com.openexchange.rest.services.basic-auth.login
    configuration parameter. Credentials are sent in the Authorization header using
    the standard HTTP Basic Authentication scheme (base64-encoded username:password).
- information_source; https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/releases/8.34/helmdocs/switchboard.html:
  - The switchboard service authenticates with App Suite using token-based authentication
    via the redeemToken API. A secret must be created at `/opt/open-xchange/etc/tokenlogin-secrets`
    and made available to the switchboard pod; the service injects brand information
    into a JWT token, which is only included if the `io.ox/core//brand` setting is
    configured as a protected setting by the administrator.
- information_source; https://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/http/7.10.0/index.html:
  - A system must register itself at the server and identify using a key configured
    at the Open-Xchange server for internal communication. Sessions can be acquired
    via token exchange (acquireToken action) and redeemed on another system (redeemToken
    action), with the session optionally containing the user's password. The system
    must provide its configured key to authenticate itself during token redemption
    and secret refresh operations.
  - 'All three requests require a session parameter passed as a query parameter: `session=...`.
    This session token must be obtained through prior authentication (typically via
    login) and included in every API call to maintain the authenticated state.'
