  - Authentication uses username and password credentials passed via a DSCredentials
    object to a login endpoint, which returns a session identifier (SID) string used
    for subsequent API calls. The credentials are set using setUserName() and setPassword()
    methods on the DSCredentials object, then submitted to authClient.login(credentials).
