auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.iswigo.com/doc/current/api/reference:
  - 'All API requests require three authentication headers: X-Iswigo-App (application
    identifier), X-Iswigo-Signature (request signature), and Authorization with a
    Bearer token (user access token). Send credentials via these three required headers
    in every request.'
  - 'All endpoints require two headers for request signing: X-Iswigo-App (application
    identifier, value {{APP_NAME}}) and X-Iswigo-Signature (request signature, value
    {{SIGNATURE}}). The POST /providers/suggestion endpoint additionally requires
    a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}"
    for user authentication.'
  - Authentication uses custom headers with an app identifier and request signature.
    Send X-Iswigo-App header with your application name and X-Iswigo-Signature header
    with the request signature. For token-based authentication, POST to https://api.iswigo.com/v1/authenticate
    with email and password in the JSON body to receive a JWT token in the response.
  - 'Authentication uses three required headers: X-Iswigo-App containing the app name,
    X-Iswigo-Signature containing a signature value, and Authorization header with
    Bearer token scheme using an ACCESS_TOKEN value.'
  - 'Authentication uses two required headers: X-Iswigo-App (containing the application
    identifier {{APP_NAME}}) and X-Iswigo-Signature (containing the request signature
    {{SIGNATURE}}). Both headers must be included in every request.'
