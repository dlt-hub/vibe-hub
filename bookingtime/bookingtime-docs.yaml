- information_source; https://developer.bookingtime.com/hc/en-us/articles/11064077333276-How-to-use-the-module-API:
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Send requests
    with the header Authorization: Bearer <JWT_token>, where the JWT token is obtained
    from the authentication service and includes claims like aud, iat, and sub.'
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the token as "Authorization: Bearer
    <token_value>" in the request headers when making API calls to book appointments
    and access protected endpoints.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where {token} is a JWT-like credential
    (e.g., eyJhbGc...). The token must be included with each request to the API endpoints.'
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with refresh token support. Obtain initial access
    token by POSTing to https://auth.bookingtime.com/oauth/token with grant_type "client_credentials"
    and client_id in the request body. Exchange refresh tokens for organization-specific
    access tokens by POSTing grant_type "refresh_token", client_id, refresh_token,
    and organization_id. Use the returned access token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" for API requests to https://api.bookingtime.com/app/v3/. Tokens
    expire after 1800 seconds.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow is used for authentication. To refresh an access token,
    send a POST request to https://auth.bookingtime.com/oauth/token with grant_type
    set to refresh_token, client_id, refresh_token, and organization_id as body parameters.
    The response includes an access_token with token_type Bearer and expires_in of
    300 seconds. Use the access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}"
    for subsequent API requests to https://api.bookingtime.com/app/v3/.
