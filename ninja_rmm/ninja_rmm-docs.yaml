Based on the provided documentation for the NinjaRMM API, hereâ€™s a complete YAML configuration that adheres to the specified structure:

client:
  base_url: "https://app.ninjarmm.com"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"
    token: "X-Api-Key"  # The API key should be provided in the header with this name

        description: "The start date for activities (format: YYYY-MM-DD)."
      - name: "end_date"  # Filter by end date
        type: "string"
        required: false
        description: "The end date for activities (format: YYYY-MM-DD)."
    data_selector: "$.data"

notes:
  - "API key authentication is required in the request header under the name 'X-Api-Key'."
  - "Be mindful of rate limits when making requests to the API."
  - "Pagination may be necessary for endpoints returning large datasets."

errors:
  - 401  # Unauthorized
  - 403  # Forbidden
  - 429  # Too Many Requests
