auth_info:
- information_source; https://roxy-wi.org/description/api:
  - You should always include an access token in the request headers. The token is
    generated through a login process (instructions provided in the documentation).
    Access tokens are required in request headers for all API calls to Roxy-WI.
- information_source; https://roxy-wi.org/description/new-api:
  - 'Authorization is required via Bearer token in the Authorization header. The token
    is a JWT that includes user_id, group, and expiration (exp) claims. Send the token
    as "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_token>" in the request header.'
  - To use the API, you must obtain an authorization token by making a POST request
    to the /api/login endpoint with Content-Type application/json header and credentials
    in the request body. The token is then used in subsequent API requests for authorization.
