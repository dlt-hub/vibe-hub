    parameter, integer >= 0) to control page size and starting position. Response
    includes count (total items), next (URL for next page), previous (URL for previous
    page), and results (data array). Stop paginating when next is null.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer >= 1, default 10) to set maximum

    until fewer items than limit are returned.
