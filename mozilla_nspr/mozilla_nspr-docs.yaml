notes:
- WebRTC is responsible for realtime audio and video communication.
- Includes issues like low-level camera and microphone access.
- Pref names are 8-bit strings, and ASCII in practice.
- There is a 1 MiB length limit on string values; longer strings are rejected outright.
- Each pref consists of a default value and/or a user value.
- 'Prefs are Firefox’s equivalent of the Windows Registry: a dumping ground for anything
  and everything.'
- Tips on generating valid performance metrics by benchmarking
- GPU Performance Tips for reducing impacts on browser performance in front-end code
- NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License v2 (MPLv2).
- You need an account on Mozilla’s Auth0 instance in order to authenticate when submitting
  via Lando.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Tests can run on local builds.
- Most mobile tests run on emulators, but some run on hardware devices.
- Most test jobs now expose an environment variable named MOZ_UPLOAD_DIR.
- Passing MOZ_RECORD_TEST=1 as an environment variable when running some tests will
  trigger a recording of the desktop with GNOME Screencast.
- For browser chrome mochitests, passing MOZ_DEVTOOLS_TEST_SCOPES=1 as an environment
  variable will record all variables and arguments available in the scope of the test
  when any assert fails.
- It is typically to see 3-10% of the jobs fail, although the majority of the failures
  are intermittent.
- Sheriffs annotate intermittent failures in Treeherder.
- If you are running this manually or on configs/tests that are not supported with
  ./mach try –new-test-config, then please follow the steps here.
- Intermittent oranges are test failures which happen intermittently, in a seemingly
  random way.
- They are also called flaky tests in other projects.
- When doing time differences the operating system timers resolution should be taken
  into account.
- Tests that remove the original tab from the browser chrome test window can cause
  intermittent oranges.
- Intermittents are test failures which happen intermittently, in a seemingly random
  way.
- These intermittent failures are tracked in Bugzilla.
- Sometimes tests start failing more frequently and these reports are then posted
  daily.
- These tests do not run on Android.
- Please use this document as a reference for existing chrome tests as you do not
  want to create new chrome tests.
- If you’re trying to test privileged browser code, write a browser mochitest instead;
  if you are testing web platform code, use a wpt test, or a 'plain' mochitest if
  you are unable to use a wpt test.
- This program provides the HTTP API described by the WebDriver protocol to communicate
  with Gecko browsers.
- TV only applies to mochitests (all flavors and subsuites), reftests (including crashtests
  and js-reftests) and xpcshell tests; a separate job, TVw, handles web-platform tests.
- Only some of the test chaos mode features are enabled.
- Generally these test jobs are only run if code inside the gfx/wr subtree are touched.
- Mochitest is an automated testing framework built on top of the MochiKit JavaScript
  libraries.
- Tests must run in a focused window, which effectively prevents any other user activity
  on the engaged computer.
- xpcshell test filenames must start with test_
- xpcshell tests are quick-to-run tests, generally used to write unit tests.
- xpcshell test filenames must start with 'test_'.
- xpcshell tests are quick-to-run tests, that are generally used to write unit tests.
- Tests can be filtered by tags when running multiple tests.
- The head JavaScript file is run once before a test suite is run.
- TPS runs against the real Mozilla Accounts server and Sync servers.
- Most of the time, browsing to http://localhost:8000 will allow running the test,
  although some tests have special requirements, such as running on a specific domain
  or running using https.
- GTest will run tests in parallel. Don’t add unit tests that are not threadsafe.
- Gtests currently run from the test package under the GTest symbol on Treeherder
  if you want to verify that your test is working.
- Performance tests are designed to catch performance regressions before they reach
  our end users.
- There is no unified approach for performance tests at this time.
- Generated reports can be filtered by platform and/or test suite.
- Use of one-click loaner for generating reports.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Some tasks are not permitted to use external resources
- Gecko is Mozilla’s rendering engine for the web.
- Visual Studio Code is the recommended editor for Firefox development.
- Submitting untested patches wastes the committer’s time, and may burn the release
  tree.
- Minidumps contain complete contents of program memory, potentially private information.
- Most of our crash-reporting infrastructure is based on rust-minidump.
- Uses GDB for debugging Firefox processes.
- Attaching gdb to Firefox might fail on Linux distributions that enable common kernel
  hardening features.
- On Fedora, you need to enable the debuginfo repositories, as the packages are in
  separate repositories.
- Enable them permanently, so when you get updates you also get security updates for
  these packages.
- Mozilla employees have a paid subscription to Pernosco, and are encouraged to use
  it.
- Contributors can use Pernosco as well. A free account comes with 5 uploads to see
  if it is suitable for your workflow.
- rr requires a VM hypervisor that virtualizes CPU performance counters.
- There’s a 20% or so performance hit from running in a VM.
- Expect lower performance and a somewhat higher false positive error rate than on
  Linux.
- Valgrind’s handling of malloc zones on Yosemite is imperfect. Regard leak reports
  with caution.
- Valgrind has been known to cause kernel panics, for unknown reasons.
- Official builds of Firefox 69 and later are Notarized.
- It is recommended to debug with try builds or local builds.
- Firefox does not start the main process directly, it starts it via a Launcher Process.
- When printing to STDOUT from a content process, the console message will not appear
  on Windows.
- Not all web conferencing software makes extensive use of WebRTC.
- Currently, one must refer to the SDP in order to interpret the RTP packets.
- Running ./mach <verb> --help is an indispensable tool for discovering options that
  can streamline your testing process.
- Using about:webrtc to Diagnose Delay
- Locally running the WebRTC mochitests should be done in a Firefox dev environment
  using `mach`.
- For simple issues, check the web developer console for error messages related to
  media format issues.
- Running WPT tests locally can be very disruptive to one’s working desktop environment,
  as windows will frequently appear and grab focus.
- These instructions are for a Linux TreeHerder build for MacOS, so they might require
  some modifications for other combinations of platforms.
- Note that these files are very large so you’ll want to delete them and the extracted
  files when you are done.
- The memory dump contains URLs of active tabs, history information, and possibly
  even passwords.
- When filing a crash report, it is important to know whether the crash occurs with
  Firefox safe mode.
- This page is an import from MDN and the contents might be outdated
- Most crash reports lack sufficient data for a developer to understand why the crash
  occurred.
- Some fields are privacy-sensitive and are only visible to users with minidump access.
- To locally test macOS builds that are signed like production builds and can use
  restricted entitlements, you need a valid development signing certificate and provisioning
  profile from Mozilla’s Apple Developer account.
- You’ll also need to have Xcode installed and be signed in to your Apple ID within
  Xcode.
- Local builds are not signed automatically and mach doesn’t include support for running
  tests on signed builds.
- On Apple Silicon Macs, Firefox binaries will be “ad-hoc” self-signed automatically
  by the linker during compilation.
- Artifact builds are supported for users of Mercurial and Git.
- 'Artifact builds are rather delicate: any mismatch between your local source directory
  and the downloaded binary artifacts can result in difficult to diagnose incompatibilities.'
- It is recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM for building Firefox.
- Building on a machine with an SSD is strongly preferred.
- If you build Firefox often, add ac_add_options --with-ccache=sccache to .mozconfig.
- The default build is a compiled build with optimizations.
- The view shows a maximum of 10 results by default.
- The user can opt out of showing search suggestions in the address bar by unchecking
  'Provide search suggestions' or 'Show search suggestions in address bar results'.
- The UrlbarQueryContext object describes a single instance of a search.
- This document only covers Legacy telemetry, not Glean telemetry.
- Data is sent with every user keystroke in the address bar when enabled.
- Frecency is a term derived from frequency and recency, its scope is to provide a
  ranking algorithm that gives importance both to how often a page is accessed and
  when it was last visited.
- Records information about browser usage interactions and UI customizations.
- A review is required before code or tests are added to Mozilla’s repository.
- Once approved, code is merged to autoland and once tests pass, sheriffs will merge
  it with other commits to mozilla-central.
- Publishers use the BrowserUtils.callModulesFromCategory to invoke consumers.
- Consumers are registered using a category manager mechanism.
- This document describes the implementation of the Firefox Places component.
- It is a robust system to manage History and Bookmarks through a database on the
  backend side and a model-view-controller system that connects frontend UI user manipulation.
- Do not create a new input that would have the same identifier as any other input.
  All identifiers must be unique.
- JSProcessActors are the replacement for e10s-era process scripts.
- JSWindowActors replace framescripts and are structured in pairs.
- Actors are instantiated lazily to save processing time.
- State should ideally be stored in the parent process.
- Gecko's security model is based on the same-origin policy.
- JavaScript code runs with system privileges, posing security risks.
- Xray vision helps JavaScript running in a privileged security context safely access
  objects created by less privileged code.
- Generates storage structure for maplike and setlike interfaces.
- Implementing Web IDL using Javascript is deprecated. New interfaces should always
  be implemented in C++!
- IOUtils is a privileged JavaScript API for performing file I/O in the Firefox frontend.
- '`IOUtils` is mostly async-only.'
- Use Counters are collected using Glean as counter metrics on the use-counters ping.
- The editor module has not been maintained aggressively about a decade.
- This module needs to be treated as a young module or in a transition period to align
  the behavior to the other browsers and take modern C++ style.
- This module does really complicated things which may cause security issues.
- This test manifest format could be used by other harnesses, such as ones that do
  not depend on XUL, or even ones testing other layout engines.
- Some tests may require synthesized user input events or other functions that normally
  cannot be run from a typical script.
- Use a debug build or add `ac_add_options --enable-layout-debugger` to your mozconfig.
- Run with `./mach run --layoutdebug [filename]`
- Enabled on Firefox with touch-event support since 51.
- Defaults off, but it can be turned on to force enable AccessibleCaret.
- This document is an overview of the steps to render a webpage, and how HTML gets
  transformed and broken down, step by step, into commands that can execute on the
  GPU.
- If you’re coming into the graphics team with not a lot of background in browsers,
  start here.
- Top-level actors are harder to create and destroy than normal actors.
- Background actors can only be used in limited circumstances.
- Creating background actors is done a bit differently than normal managees.
- Firefox has, to date, undergone exactly one occurrence of the removal of a process
  type.
- The choice of process type may affect browser stability.
- Debugging a child process at the start of its life is tricky.
- Windows users have options that work with both the Visual Studio and WinDbg debuggers.
- Linux and mac users should reference gdb’s detach-on-fork.
- Processes can be killed anytime for reasons that are out of our control.
- Shutdown is managed via notification observers.
- In opt builds, the shutdown sequence can finish earlier depending on the toolkit.shutdown.fastShutdownStage
  preference.
- Be aware that not all test harnesses leverage all shutdown phases.
- Due to this many shutdown code paths are rarely tested intentionally and problems
  pop up randomly.
- IPDL communications take place between parent and child objects called actors.
- An actor is explicitly bound to its endpoint.
- The messages are grouped into blocks by parent, child, and both.
- The async actor will not wait for a response.
- Top-level actors previously required a dedicated message channel, which are limited
  OS resources.
- Includes a built-in Hunspell dictionary based on the SCOWL dataset.
- This guide shows you how to build SpiderMonkey using mach
- Use the environment variable USE_DEBUGGER=1 to set a breakpoint in the simulator
  for arm64
- Use ARM_SIM_DEBUGGER=1 for arm32 debugging
- Some pieces can happen in parallel, so it’s not necessary to work directly top-down.
- Use Counters are used to collect data about the execution of Firefox.
- Telemetry reports only if a feature was used, not how many times.
- If you are on Mac and baldrdash fails to compile with something similar to 'inttypes.h'
  file not found, this is because, starting from Mojave, headers are no longer installed
  in '/usr/include'.
- The release notes also states that this compatibility package will no longer be
  provided in the near future, so the build system on macOS will have to be adapted
  to look for headers in the SDK.
- Top-level await is not supported in the system module, due to the requirement for
  synchronous loading.
- Gecko provides multiple ways to load/evaluate JS files from JS files.
- The system module uses the .sys.mjs filename extension.
- By default, if .get() is called before the local database had the chance to be synchronized,
  and if no initial data was provided, then the settings will be pulled from the server
  in order to avoid returning an empty list.
- Uses Remote Settings for synchronization.
- Polling for changes can be triggered manually with pollChanges().
- The permission manager offers a way to store user preferences on a per-origin basis.
- Permission values can be '0' (Undefined), '1' (Allow), '2' (Deny), or '3' (Prompt
  the user).
- Firefox runs on 10.15 and above.
- The minimum supported SDK version for local builds is 13.3.
- Blocking a DLL with the static blocklist should be our last resort to fix a problem
  because doing it normally breaks functionality of an application which installed
  the DLL.
- It is possible that users can get Firefox into a bad state by putting a DLL on the
  dynamic blocklist.
- By launching Firefox with `--disableDynamicBlocklist`, the dynamic blocklist will
  be loaded but not used to block DLLs.
- Limited Access Features require a special token and attestation to unlock them before
  their corresponding APIs can be called.
- 'FF HCM only affects web content, so changing the option in this select will only
  alter color usage for web pages. It will not change FF chrome. Current behaviour
  on chrome pages (ie. about: pages) is undefined.'
- By default, browser.display.document_color_use is set to 2 on Windows. If a user
  turns on the OS HCM Firefox will automatically go into HCM mode as well.
- Firefox supports both the prefers-contrast and forced-colors media queries.
- These queries detect a user’s display settings and allow authors to adjust content
  styling accordingly.
- prefers-contrast and forced-colors are not mutually exclusive.
- prefers-contrast requires specific, case-by-case overriding, whereas forced-colors
  is largely about inheritance.
- Attempts to use `ccache` will likely result in failure to compile.
- It is also necessary to avoid optimized builds, as these will modify macros which
  will result in many false positives.
- We document here the decision making and planning around when we update the Rust
  toolchains used and required to build Firefox.
- This allows contributors to know when new features will be usable, and downstream
  packagers to know what toolchain will be required for each Firefox release.
- The API for the Remote Settings can be found in the Mozilla Rust components Kotlin
  API Reference and Swift API Reference.
- RemoteSettingsClient instances can be used to fetch remote settings records.
- The API for the SuggestStore can be found in the MozillaComponents Kotlin documentation.
- The Suggest API is synchronous, which means calling it directly will block the current
  thread.
- The profiler code constantly evolves to respond to bugs or to provide new exciting
  features.
- Native stack sampling includes Rust frames without special handling.
- The profiler Rust API needs to be included in the project dependencies.
- Native Allocations feature is only available in Nightly
- The overhead is quite high, especially on systems with more expensive stack walking,
  like Linux
- Locale sensitive operations are always considered 'best-effort'.
- It is always better to use a locale fallback chain over a single locale.
- By default, Gecko will only look into OS Preferences if the language portion of
  the locale of the OS and Firefox match.
- If Windows is in 'en-AU' and Firefox is in 'en-US' Gecko will look into Windows
  Regional Preferences, but if Windows is in 'de-CH' and Firefox is in 'fr-FR' it
  won’t.
- To force Gecko to look into OS preferences irrelevant of the language match, set
  the flag 'intl.regional_prefs.use_os_locales' to 'true'.
- Gecko supports the limitation by accepting the 3-letter variants in our APIs and
  also provides a special 'appLocalesAsLangTags' method which returns this locale
  in that form.
- Most of the APIs are backed by the Unicode projects CLDR and ICU and are focused
  on enabling front-end code internationalization.
- ICU includes functionality we never use, so we don’t naively compile all of it.
- Locale data is precompiled into a large, endian-specific file.
- Updating ICU will also update the language tag registry (which records language
  tag semantics needed to correctly implement Intl functionality).
- Make sure you have a usable icupkg on your system.
- ICU4X data is bundled directly as a rust crate with `compiled_data` feature.
- Updating ICU4X crate into Gecko requires checking `Cargo.toml` in Gecko’s root directory.
- Localizers maintain a single source of truth. They can translate Nightly, while
  updating Beta, Developer Edition or even Release and ESR.
- It extends the window of time localizers can work on strings before deadlines.
- Uplifting string changes has less of an impact on the localization toolchain, and
  their impact can be evaluated case by case.
- This tutorial is intended for Firefox engineers already familiar with the previous
  localization systems offered by Gecko - DTD and StringBundle - and assumes prior
  experience with those systems.
- Fluent is a modern localization system introduced into the Gecko platform with a
  focus on quality, performance, maintenance and completeness.
- On debug builds if the Fluent arguments are not provided, then Firefox will crash.
- Various interest attributes available for querying.
