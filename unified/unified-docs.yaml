notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Different from Unified.to's synthetic data sandbox environment; these sandbox accounts
  are for testing with real integration endpoints in production.
- Most current LLM models have severe limits on how many tools they can handle.
- Token must be provided as a URL parameter or in the Authorization header.
- Unified API simplifies and streamlines interactions for developers.
- Standardization means consistent methods for data requests.
- The API provides mock candidates in the Sandbox environment.
- This directory provides guidance for obtaining sandbox accounts for integrations
  supported by Unified.to.
- You must provide a `token` to the MCP server either as a `token` URL parameter or
  in the Authorization header as a `bearer token`.
- The authorization flow is simplified in the Sandbox environment.
- negative for CREDIT, positive for DEBIT
- External identifier for this invoice
- 'Valid values for status: DRAFT, VOIDED, AUTHORIZED, PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID'
- 'Valid values for payment_collection_method: send_invoice, charge_automatically'
- 'Valid status values: DRAFT, VOIDED, AUTHORIZED, PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID'
- View field support, webhooks, and list parameters for each integration on the Supported
  Integrations page.
- 'Valid values for status include: SCHEDULED, AWAITING_FEEDBACK, COMPLETE, CANCELED,
  NEEDS_SCHEDULING'
- Authentication-only integrations should not be used to create connections.
- A contact represents a person that optionally is associated with a call
- Verify the JWT with your workspace secret on your server.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in unified.to
- 'Valid values for status include: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, SPAM'
- A company represents an organization that optionally is associated with a deal and/or
  contacts
- A deal represents an opportunity with companies and/or contacts
- An event represents an event, activity, or engagement and is always associated with
  a deal, contact, or company
- A person object from an enrichment integration
- The maximum number of tokens that the model can process in a single response is
  limited to ensure computational efficiency and resource management.
- A lower temperature leads to more predictable outputs while a higher temperature
  results in more varied and sometimes more creative outputs.
- A contact represents a person that optionally is associated with a deal and/or a
  company
- Valid values for status are 'SUCCEEDED', 'PENDING', 'FAILED', 'CANCELED'
- Passthrough API responses contain raw data
- Response formats will vary between platforms
- 'Valid values for status: SUCCEEDED, PENDING, FAILED, CANCELED'
- Use the SCIM API to manage user provisioning, deprovisioning, and attribute updates
  in an employee directory.
- Our SCIM API is based on the RFC 7644 standard with extensions in the User schema.
- Valid values for status include 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED'.
- Background checks and compliance checks return CLEARFLAGGED or PASS/FAIL or YES/NO
- Most modern IDV providers (like Onfido, Veriff, Jumio, ID.me).
- By default, most list endpoints return a maximum of 100 records per page.
- You can change the number of records on a per-request basis by passing a limit parameter.
- You can't exceed 100 records per page on most endpoints.
- The offset parameter specifies the position of the first result and is zero-based.
- All dates are in a YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.
- Use URL IDs and payload data that are properly formatted (e.g. ID=5de520f96e439b002043d8dc).
- Rate limiting is an important aspect of working with APIs that helps maintain system
  stability and ensure fair usage across all users.
- When you hit a rate limit, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.
- Connection health is dynamic and can change with each API call.
- Not all errors indicate a broken connection, and some error types are treated as
  successful responses in certain contexts.
- Webhooks allow servers to send real-time notifications to other servers when a specific
  event occurs.
- Webhooks enable instant communication between different systems, making them crucial
  for maintaining data synchronization and triggering automated workflows.
- Default limit is 100
- Default offset is 0
- Always request the minimum set of scopes required for your application to function.
- If you do not specify any scopes at all, then Unified.to will attempt to request
  all the scopes available for the integration.
- Requires setup of connected app in Unified API
- Webhooks can only be created from existing connections.
- The 'updated' event will also be sent when the data object is first created.
- Default parameters include limit=100 and offset=0
- If you delete a connection, any webhooks that are associated with it will also be
  deleted.
errors:
- '400 Bad Request: Verify the request parameters and payload.'

- '404 Not Found: Ensure the endpoint is correct.'
- '400: Bad Request: Required parameters are missing or in the wrong format. Check
  the request payload against the API documentation.'
- '401: Unauthorized: The connection is likely broken and requires recreation. This
  typically occurs when app access has been revoked or authentication credentials
  are invalid.'

  indicates a mismatch between the scopes configured in your provider''s developer
  account and what Unified.to is requesting.'
