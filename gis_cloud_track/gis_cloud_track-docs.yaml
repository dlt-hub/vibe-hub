pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.giscloud.com/rest:
  - Pagination information is present. The endpoint supports a page parameter as a
    query parameter to specify which page number to display, though the documentation
    does not explicitly state whether it is required or optional, or provide details
    about page size, total pages, or navigation fields in the response.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters to control page size and starting
    position. The response includes total (total result count), page (current page
    number), and data array with results. Use offset to navigate through pages until
    all results are retrieved.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (default 1) and returns total count
    and current page number in the response. Stop when all items across pages are
    retrieved based on the total field.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (page number to display) and perpage
    (number of results per page). The documentation does not specify response fields
    indicating pagination state or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses perpage query parameter to specify results per page and page query
    parameter to specify which page to display. The example shows perpage=10 for 10
    records per page.
