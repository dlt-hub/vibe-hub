auth_info:

  - 'Basic authentication uses a username and password that are base64 encoded and
    sent in an Authorization header. OAuth 2.0 uses token-based authorization where
    tokens are generated during connection setup and stored for reuse. The "Other"
    method involves a separate login call on each request that returns a token passed
    as a header, POST payload, or URL parameter.


    For Basic auth, provide User ID and Password for Basic Authentication fields,
    which are combined as username:password, base64 encoded, and appended to request
    headers as an Authorization header. For OAuth 2.0, tokens are generated and managed
    by the platform during the connection workflow. For the "Other" type, implement
    a login endpoint call that returns a token to be passed in subsequent requests
    via headers, POST body, or URL parameters as required by the API.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication is used for REST API datasources. Auth tokens obtained
    from the datasource auth request are passed in HTTP headers using the syntax {tokenName},
    typically as Authorization: Bearer {access_token}. Additional optional headers
    can be specified one per line, and URL parameters can be added separately.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication is used with client credentials (OAuth Client ID and
    OAuth Client Secret) obtained during application registration. The flow involves
    exchanging an authorization code for an access token via the OAuth Access Token
    URL, with user permissions defined by OAuth Scope, and requires registering the
    OAuth callback URL with the provider in advance.


    Required fields: OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret, OAuth Scope (space-separated),
    OAuth callback URL, OAuth Authorization URL (with tokens for clientId, callbackURL:url,
    scope, response_type=code, and state), OAuth Access Token URL, and OAuth Access
    Token Header. The authorization URL opens a browser popup where users sign in
    and grant permissions, then the provider redirects to the callback URL with an
    authorization code that is exchanged for an access token at the Access Token URL.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with support for refresh tokens. Required parameters
    include client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri (callbackURL), and scope. The flow
    uses authorization code exchange for access tokens, with refresh_token for token
    renewal. Optional state parameter (knowiSessionToken) maintains request state.
    Connection properties like readTimeout and connectTimeout can be configured via
    URL parameters.
  - 'OAuth2 refresh token flow is supported. Access tokens expire and are refreshed
    by POSTing to an OAuth Refresh Access Token URL with refresh token credentials.
    The refresh request requires: OAuth Refresh Token Header (e.g., Content-Type and
    Authorization headers), OAuth Post Data containing grant_type=refresh_token and
    {refresh_token} placeholder (may also include client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri
    depending on provider), and optionally OAuth Refresh Token Type set to "Limited-Use
    Refresh Token" to store updated refresh tokens. New access tokens are extracted
    from the response and used in subsequent REST calls; new refresh tokens are stored
    if the refresh token type supports it.'

  - Pagination information can be accessed via response headers using the "HTTP response
    headers pagination" checkbox. The pagination start value defaults to 0 for POST
    payload with $C9_POST_PAGE_INDEX token, or 1 for sequential page numbers, and
    is offset by array element count.
