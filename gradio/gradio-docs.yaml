auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface:
  - A custom authentication dependency function can be provided via the auth_dependency
    parameter, which accepts a Callable that takes a FastAPI Request object and returns
    either a string user ID or None. If None is returned, the user receives a 401
    Unauthorized response. This integrates with external authentication systems like
    OAuth and cannot be used together with the auth parameter.

  - 'To query private Spaces on Hugging Face, include a Hugging Face token in the
    Authorization header. Pass the token as a Bearer token in the format "Authorization:
    Bearer $HF_TOKEN", where $HF_TOKEN is obtained from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.
    This header must be included in requests to private Spaces for authentication.'
