notes:
- Google authentication flow is a bit different from the other standard authentication
  flows.
- In some versions of Unity when running on Android, the player view is brought to
  front when switching back from a pause state, which causes the web view to be invisible
  when the app is resumed. It requires an additional step to bring the web view to
  front to make the web view visible. Set RestoreViewHierarchyOnResume to true to
  apply this workaround.
- Android did not provide a way to get the HTTP status code until API Level 23 (Android
  6). The statusCode is not trustable and will be always 200 on Android devices running
  a system before Android 6.
- This event is deprecated. Use OnLoadingErrorReceived instead.
- This method does not affect the ReferenceRectTransform or Unity's transform component.
- By setting to true, access to file URLs inside the web view will be enabled and
  you could access sub-resources or make cross origin requests from local HTML files.
- By setting to false, any load from a file URL file:// for Load method will be rejected.
- This method only works on iOS and macOS Editor.
- Most of the OAuth flows now support refresh token.
- 4.0.0 is a major update of UniWebView. Although most of APIs in UniWebView 4 are
  compatible with UniWebView 3 and it should be easy enough to migrate, there are
  still a few breaking changes.
- The minimum deploy target of UniWebView 6 is iOS 12.0 and Android 5.0 (API Level
  21).
- For Unity, we recommend using Unity 2021.3.37 LTS, 2022.3.23 LTS, or any Unity 6
  (6000.x) version.
- If Unity reports any error when you play the scene, try to restart your Unity Editor
  and give it a chance to load the plugin at launch.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses URL scheme `uniwebview://` for messaging.
- Game will restart when an obstacle is hit.
- Safe Browsing Mode is a simpler and out-of-the-box solution to show the web page
  as it is in the browser.
- You can only use the Safe Browsing Mode when the property is true.
- Frame property will be ignored if you use the method described in 'Using Reference
  UI Element' (or say, if the ReferenceRectTransform property is not null).
- If you do not set the Frame again in the OnOrientationChanged event, the web view
  size will keep what it is initially set and your layout will be broken.
- When applying rotation and scale, the toolbar height will be still calculated by
  the original frame size.
- To manage memory effectively with UniWebView, destroy unused web views promptly,
  reset references when closed, and clear caches when not needed.
- Memory is a key limitation on mobile platforms.
- The Channel Messaging System is available starting from UniWebView v6.
- A safe length is ~16KB for a URL.
- Security is a multi-layered approach. Implement appropriate measures based on your
  application's security requirements and threat model.
- UniWebView allows adding and executing JavaScript functions on web pages, with options
  to disable JavaScript for performance or security.
- Supports OAuth 2.0 for multiple providers, offering customizable flows and secure
  authentication methods.
- The system will remember the session for a certain service unless the user logs
  out.
- The values here are only for demonstration purpose. In your implementation, replace
  them to the actual values of your app.
- Requires setup of OAuth Client ID in Google Cloud Console
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- UniWebView supports file uploads from the disk of your device or from a cloud service
  to your website.
- On iOS, if you just want your user upload images from the photo library, it should
  already work without any effort.
- File download should work correctly without any additional configuration.
- On iOS, there is no system-level web view downloading support.
- UniWebView supports HTML5 video playback with options for auto play and inline play,
  but does not support Flash-based videos.
- UniWebView supports HTTP Basic and Digest authentication, prompting users for credentials
  and storing them permanently.
- On macOS, the credentials are stored in system Keychain.
- To get full support for a new window or new tab, we suggest you choose to use the
  Safe Browsing Mode.
- UniWebView enables clicking through transparent web pages to interact with Unity
  scenes behind.
- UniWebView allows rendering web content as a non-interactive texture in Unity, suitable
  for 3D integration but with performance and feature limitations.
- The rendered texture is not interactive. You cannot click any link or button on
  the texture, or scroll the web view by gesture.
- Any hardware-accelerated content, such as video or WebGL elements, cannot be rendered.
- WebRTC is supported from iOS 14.3 and all Android versions.
- Due to a memory bug under WebKit and Unity, it might crash your macOS Editor when
  you stop playing with an inspector showing embedded in a web view.
- UniWebView build errors and runtime crashes can be resolved by adjusting settings
  in Unity Preferences and performing a clean build.
- UniWebView 6 focuses on high-performance bidirectional messaging, reliability on
  new iOS versions, build automation for Android large app scenarios, and modernization
  of iOS distribution.
- To migrate from UniWebView 5 to 6, remove old files, install the new version, and
  explore the new Channel Messaging System for enhanced bidirectional communication.
- Before you start the migration, we strongly suggest that you should backup your
  project.
- Upgrade from UniWebView 5 to 6 requires removal of old files and installation of
  the new version.
- Consider upgrading existing URL scheme messaging to Channel Messages for better
  performance and reliability.
- The new toolbar works for both iOS and Android, and is more flexible and customizable.
- UniWebView provides the out-of-box level support for most popular OAuth 2.0 providers.
- The most noticeable change in UniWebView 5 is the new built-in OAuth 2.0 support.
- UniWebView follows ToS of Unity Asset Store.
- UniWebView prioritizes privacy, collecting minimal data, using it only for order
  processing, and ensuring secure transmission with encryption.
- On some certain Android customized builds, the manufacturer prefers not containing
  the web view package in the system or blocks the web view package from being installed.
- In some versions of Unity when running on Android, the player view is brought to
  front when switching back from a pause state, which causes the web view is invisible
  when the app is resumed.
- In some versions of Unity when running on Android, the player view is brought to
  front when switching back from a pause state, which causes the web view to be invisible
  when the app is resumed.
- You need to call this method as soon as you create a web view, before you call any
  other methods related to web view layout.
- By setting this to `false`, any load from a file URL `file://` for `Load` method
  will be rejected and trigger an `OnLoadingErrorReceived` event.
- By default, it is `true` and the local file URL loading is allowed.
- On iOS, this method does nothing because WKWebView fundamentally does not support
  third party cookies.
- Starting from iOS 18, the default SameSite cookie attribute changed from 'None'
  to 'Lax'.
- You need to set it before creating a web view. Existing web views are not affected.
- This only works on Android.
- Deprecated methods should not be used anymore.
- On iOS and Android, the web view does not support JavaScript (window.print()), you
  can only initialize a print job from Unity by the Print method.
- Upgrade from UniWebView 5 to 6 requires minimal effort.
- Backup your project before migration.
- Browsing web content in UniWebViewSafeBrowsing is only supported on iOS and Android.
- Creating and showing a UniWebViewSafeBrowsing on Unity Editor will fall back to
  open the URL in external browser.
- On iOS, it uses some "hidden" way by setting `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` in config
  preferences for WebKit.
- On Android, it sets the `WebSettings.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` for the current
  web view.
- This method only works for Android. On iOS, this method does nothing because WKWebView
  fundamentally does not support third party cookies.
- This requires additional setup in `WKAppBoundDomains` key in the Info.plist file.
- This method only works on Android.
- Facebook suggests to use the Facebook SDKs for mobile apps.
- LINE authentication flow is a bit different from the other standard authentication
  flows.
- UniWebView 6 is mostly compatible with UniWebView 5.
- Setting this value may leak the client secret and cause security issue. Prefer to
  setting the PKCESupport to `S256` in the option instead.
- Requires setting Client Id, Client Secret, and Callback Url in the UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowGitHub
  inspector.
- Requires setting Client Id, Redirect Uri, and Scope in the inspector.
- Facebook suggests to use the Facebook SDKs for iOS and Android for mobile apps.
- Most of the built-in authentication flows in UniWebView are using the same model
  of this standard token.
- Usually this session processes an OAuth 2 flow.
- The client secret should not be stored on the client side.
- GitHub’s OAuth does not currently support PKCE.
- Supports customizable authentication flows
- An authentication flow usually a "code" based OAuth 2.0 flow
- Whether to start authentication as soon as the script Start.
- Whether to use private mode to authenticate the user.
- The default level is Critical, which means the logger only prints errors and exceptions.
- The default logging level is Critical, which means the logger only prints errors
  and exceptions.
