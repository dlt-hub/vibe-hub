Based on the provided documentation for the Genesys Cloud API, here is the complete YAML configuration for the REST API source:

client:
  base_url: "https://api.mypurecloud.com/"
  auth:
    type: "bearer"  # Authentication method is Bearer token

resources:
  - name: "telephony"
    endpoint: "/telephony"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters (if any, not explicitly listed in the documentation)
      location: "location_id"  # Placeholder for potential query parameters
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

  - name: "routing"
    endpoint: "/routing"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters (if any, not explicitly listed in the documentation)
      configuration_id: "config_id"  # Placeholder for potential query parameters
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

  - name: "users"
    endpoint: "/users"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters (if any, not explicitly listed in the documentation)
      user_id: "user_id"  # Placeholder for potential query parameters
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

  - "Endpoints can be combined for more complex data extraction."

  - 401  # Unauthorized
  - 403  # Forbidden
  - 429  # Too Many Requests

auth_info:
  mentioned_objects:
    - "API key or OAuth2 token is required for access."
    - "Follow the OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication."

source_metadata:
  description: "The Genesys Cloud API provides access to telephony operations, routing configurations, and user information management."
