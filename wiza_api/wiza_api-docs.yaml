    be included as a mandatory header in every request to the service. The exact header
    name for the API key is not explicitly specified in the provided documentation,
    but it is referred to as "the header of the API KEY".
  - API uses bearer token authentication via the bearer_auth security scheme. Include
    the bearer token in the Authorization header when making requests to authenticate
    API calls.
