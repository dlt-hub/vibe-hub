auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.filestack.com/sdks/:
  - The Filestack API requires an API key for authentication. Pass your API key to
    the filestack.init() method as a string parameter (e.g., filestack.init('YOUR_API_KEY')).
    The API key is used to initialize the client and authenticate requests to Filestack
    services.
- information_source; https://www.filestack.com/docs/uploads/uploading/:
  - Filestack API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named key in the
    upload endpoint URL. The key must be appended to the request as ?key=MY_API_KEY
    when making POST requests to upload files.
  - 'The authentication information from this documentation chunk is:


    API key authentication is required and must be passed as a query parameter named
    key. Include key=MY_API_KEY in the request URL when making POST requests to the
    Filestack API store endpoint, for example https://www.filestackapi.com/api/store/S3?key=MY_API_KEY.'
- information_source; https://www.filestack.com/docs/security/policies/:
  - A secret is automatically generated for each application and used to sign policies.
    The secret must be protected and never exposed client-side. Policies are JSON
    objects sent as part of the request (path, query parameters, or body) and must
    contain an "expiry" Unix timestamp field; the secret is used to cryptographically
    sign these policies, and the signature should be included in requests. Backend
    code should generate short-lived, limited-scope policies for clients. The secret
    can be regenerated but will invalidate existing signatures.
- information_source; https://www.filestack.com/docs/api/file/:
  - API key authentication is required and passed as a query parameter named key.
    For operations requiring security, policy and signature query parameters must
    be provided instead, which are HMAC-based security credentials.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.filestack.com/docs/api/management/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. Limit (default 10) controls
    page size, offset (default 0) controls starting position. Response includes limit,
    offset, and total fields to indicate current page state and total count.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes limit,
    offset, and total fields to indicate the current page position and total number
    of applications available.
