auth_info:
- information_source; https://toolsqa.com/rest-assured/api-documentation/:
  - The API uses Basic authentication. Credentials (username and password) are Base64-encoded
    and sent in the Authorization header as "Basic <encoded_credentials>". Additionally,
    the request body contains JSON with userName and password fields for token generation
    at the /Account/v1/GenerateToken endpoint.
- information_source; https://www.toolsqa.com/postman/postman-tutorial/:
  - API key authentication is required and must be passed in the Headers section of
    the request. The exact header name and API key value should be specified when
    making requests.
- information_source; https://toolsqa.com/rest-assured/basic-auth/:
  - Basic Authentication in REST APIs uses a username and password encoded in Base64
    format, sent in the Authorization header with the scheme "Basic". In REST Assured,
    you provide credentials using the auth().basic(username, password) method, which
    automatically encodes and includes them in requests.
  - 'Basic Authentication requires sending a username and password encoded in Base64
    format within the Authorization header. The header format is "Authorization: Basic
    [Base64(username:password)]", where username and password are separated by a colon
    and then Base64-encoded.'
  - Basic authentication is used where credentials are sent preemptively in the request
    header. The username and password are passed directly to the auth().preemptive().basic()
    method in RestAssured, which encodes them and automatically includes them in the
    Authorization header as base64-encoded credentials with the scheme "Basic".

  - '# Separating API Services from Test Layer


    This documentation describes best practices for organizing API testing code by
    separating concerns between the service layer and test layer.


    ## Key Concepts


    **Problem:** Mixing HTTP communication logic with test assertions makes test files
    cluttered and hard to maintain as the number of APIs grows.


    **Solution:** Create dedicated API Service classes that handle all HTTP communication,
    allowing Step Definition files (test layer) to focus solely on test parameters
    and assertions.


    ## Architecture Pattern


    **Service Layer (API Services):**

    - Encapsulates all HTTP request/response handling

    - Contains methods for each API endpoint

    - Manages request building, sending, and response capture

    - Independent of test logic


    **Test Layer (Step Definitions):**

    - Focuses on test parameters (query, headers, body)

    - Calls service layer methods

    - Asserts on responses

    - Remains clean and readable


    ## Example: Generate Token Endpoint


    For the Book Store API''s `/Account/v1/GenerateToken` endpoint:


    **Service Layer handles:** Making the HTTP POST request, managing credentials,
    capturing the response object.


    **Test Layer handles:** Passing valid/invalid credentials as parameters, asserting
    whether response is success or error.


    ## Implementation Steps


    1. Create API Service classes with methods for each endpoint

    2. Add methods that accept request parameters and return response objects

    3. Call these service methods from Step Definition files

    4. Test layer remains focused on parameters and assertions, not implementation
    details


    This separation ensures reusability across multiple test scenarios and maintains
    clean, maintainable test code.'
