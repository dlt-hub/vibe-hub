  - 'Authentication uses OAuth2.0 Bearer tokens or query string keys. Two token types
    are available: user_key for order management and partner_key for company/user
    creation. Send the token either in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer YOUR_KEY" or as a query parameter "key=YOUR_KEY". Headers must include
    "Accept: application/json" for GET requests and "Content-Type: application/json"
    for POST requests.'
  - Token-based authentication using a user_key or partner_key. The user_key is obtained
    from the user account settings and must be sent with every request. The token
    can be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization HTTP header following OAuth2.0
    specification, or alternatively as a query parameter. A partner_key is available
    for third-party developers after verification to create companies and users.
