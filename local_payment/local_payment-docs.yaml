auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.v3.localpayment.com/before-payment/authentication:
  - 'Authentication uses JWT tokens obtained via username and password credentials.
    Send a POST request to https://api.stage.localpayment.com/api/token/login with
    JSON body containing username and password (both provided by LocalPayment) to
    receive access and refresh tokens. Include the access token in subsequent requests
    (header name not explicitly specified in excerpt, but standard practice is Authorization:
    Bearer <access_token>). Access tokens expire after 5 minutes; use the refresh
    token via POST to https://api.stage.localpayment.com/api/token/refresh with JSON
    body containing the refresh token to obtain a new access token. Refresh tokens
    expire after 24 hours. All requests require header x-version: LPV3 and Content-Type:
    application/json.'
  - Authentication uses a token-based approach. Send a POST request to https://api.stage.localpayment.com/api/token/
    with username and password in the JSON body to obtain an access token and refresh
    token. Use the returned access token in subsequent API requests for authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.v3.localpayment.com/before-payment/holidays:
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication with JWT tokens passed in the Authorization
    header. The token includes claims for user_id, roles, countries, company, and
    client_code. Include the header ''Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>'' where <JWT_TOKEN>
    is the JWT access token provided by the authentication service.'
- information_source; https://docs.v3.localpayment.com/before-payment/search-payment-methods:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}", where the token appears to be a JWT.
  - JWT token required in Authorization header in format Bearer eyJ0.... The token
    is mandatory and used to authenticate requests to the payment methods endpoint.
