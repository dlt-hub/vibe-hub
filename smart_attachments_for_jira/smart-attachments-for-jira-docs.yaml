notes:
- You will only see the files if you have access to them.
- We're unable to provide the public REST API documentation for Smart Attachments
  for the Jira Cloud due to Cloud platform's peculiarities.
- When you install or update our app, JIRA will automatically grant Smart Attachments
  for Jira the correct permissions for its scope through the atlassian-addons-project-access
  role.
- We will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their rights under
  the CCPA.
- Apps are subscription-based.
- You may be granted access to certain Apps or their features for evaluation purposes
  on a trial basis.
- Your access use of the Apps may be restricted during the evaluation (trial) period.
- Any data you input and any configurations or customizations made to the App during
  your free trial may be permanently lost unless you subsequently purchase a subscription
  to the same App.
- We do not provide support and maintenance for free Apps.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Your privacy is important to us, and we are strongly committed to making our practices
  regarding your personal data more transparent and fairer.
- In the new workflow editor, post functions from third-party apps, including the
  Smart Attachments app, are not supported. Existing ones will appear as 'Unavailable
  rule.' To use them, please switch to the old editor.
- The Smart Attachments for Jira app migrates only the data for the projects available
  in Jira Cloud. You need to migrate the app simultaneously with Jira projects.
- Attachments from the default Uncategorized category won't have any labels on Jira
  Cloud after migration.
- The migration process can take up to 48 hours.
- Please note that the app prevents starting a new migration for the same host if
  another migration for it is in progress.
- You don't need to perform the re-index on Cloud. It starts automatically upon the
  end of migration.
- The app doesn't support data residency.
- The app doesn't store personal data. The app stores only macro parameters and metadata
  on our servers.
- File download can take longer than expected in the Safari browser. This is caused
  by the browser limitation.
- The app has switched from project-specific configuration of categories to category
  schemes.
- The app uses the locking of category schemes, so you may not be able to modify the
  category scheme while another user is editing it.
- The default locking timeout is five minutes.
- The default size of image thumbnails in Jira is 200x200 px.
- Bulk actions on attachments, such as removal of attachments and moving to another
  category, are not available when the issue is closed.
- You need project permissions to delete attachments.
- Bulk operation can be used for simultaneous removal of multiple files.
- Support for editing MS Office documents has been removed in 2.X versions.
- You can edit only the latest document revision.
- REST API methods are not available in Smart Attachments 2.X+ versions.
- The current API request will overwrite the existing configuration with a new one.
- REST API methods are not available in Smart Attachments 2.X+ versions. Please use
  Java API instead.
- You can move one or multiple attachments from one to another category of the same
  issue.
