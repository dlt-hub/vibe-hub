  : - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization header with
      the format "Authorization: Bearer <access_key>" in all requests. The access_key
      is your authentication credential that must be provided to access protected
      API resources.'
- information_source; https://developer2.izumanetworks.com/docs/device-management/current/user-account/jwt-keys.html:
  - JWT authentication is required for REST API requests. Include the `X-Application-ID`
    header with your application ID value, and sign requests with a JWT token using
    your private key (RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, PS256, PS384, or PS512
    algorithms supported). The JWT payload must include an `exp` claim for expiration
    time. The JWT is verified against your uploaded certificate's public key.
  - JWT keys provide REST API access to Izuma Device Management. Your application
    creates a JWT signed with a private key; Izuma Device Management validates it
    using a public verification key you upload. The private key remains in your secure
    environment while only the public key is shared with the service.
  - 'The API requires two headers for authentication: X-Application-ID header containing
    the application ID, and Authorization header with a Bearer token containing a
    JSON Web Token (JWT).'

      the next page, use the after value from the previous response in the next request''s
      after parameter; stop when has_more is false.'
