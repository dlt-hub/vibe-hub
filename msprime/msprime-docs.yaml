notes:
- These flags have been deprecated in favour of using NodeType.
- The stored tree sequence must store the full realisation of the ARG, including all
  recombination events and all common ancestor events.
- This method only supports continuous genomes.
- The infinite sites assumption means that this method is only valid for continuous
  genomes.
- Simulations can be performed using the msprime library.
- 'sim_ancestry() only simulates the ancestral trees for samples: if we want actual
  sequence data then we also need to simulate mutations on these trees.'
- Uses the msprime library for ancestry simulations
- Default sampling time is based on population settings
- The units of recombination and other rates in msprime are per unit sequence length,
  per unit time.
- Simulations of multiple chromosomes under either DTWF or the multiple merger models
  should use a discrete genome.
- The 'coalescing_segments_only' option should be set to False when recording additional
  nodes.
- Census events assume non-integer time values to avoid errors.
- The standard coalescent is the default model in msprime.
- Uses msprime for demographic simulations
- Sample individuals are allocated sequentially in the order specified
- By default msprime uses the diploid coalescent time scale.
- The Discrete Time Wright-Fisher model is an explicitly diploid model and it is therefore
  an error to run it with any ploidy value other than 2.
- Variable rates of gene conversion breakpoint initiation are not currently supported,
  but are planned for a future release.
- Many recombination maps inferred from data will contain regions at the start and
  end of the chromosome where recombination rates could not be inferred.
- These regions typically represent unassay-able segments of the chromosome, and simulated
  genetic material in these regions should be discarded in downstream analyses.
- Census events assume that they are being used as part of a continuous time simulation
  process.
- The initial state tree sequence contains the information about the ancestral histories.
- It is important to ensure the correct models are simulated in each part of the simulation.
- The demography that we obtain from Demography.from_tree_sequence() is really just
  a template, which we update and elaborate as we need.
- 'It’s important to note that sim_ancestry() only simulates the ancestral trees for
  samples: if we want actual sequence data then we also need to simulate mutations
  on these trees.'
- Default sampling time is used when drawing samples from a population.
- Census events allow adding nodes to each branch of the tree sequence at a given
  time.
- Setting simulation start time is an advanced feature which is rarely needed in practice.
- The demography object must be updated to reflect initial population sizes.
- Population sizes must be non-zero to avoid input errors during simulation.
- The implementation of the structured coalescent is quite general, but there are
  some limitations in the current implementation of the sweeps model.
- There is no concept of a population genetic model outside of the pedigree.
- Caveats when dealing with incomplete pedigree information and treatment of founders.
- Infinite waiting time until next simulation event.
- The rate parameter must be specified for mutations to be generated.
- Uses specific models for simulating genetic data.
- Neither this nor the next infinite alleles mutation model check to see if the alleles
  they produce already exist at the mutated sites.
- If you are using these models to add mutations to an already-mutated tree sequence,
  it is up to you to set the starting allele appropriately.
- Msprime version 0.x performed poorly when there were large numbers of populations.
- Version 1 has a much better support for large numbers of populations.
- Population names must be unique within a single Demography and be valid Python identifiers.
- Default sampling time for ancestral populations is set to the time of the split
  event.
- Mass migration events should generally be avoided.
- Mass migration events do not alter the migration rates between populations.
- There is no possibility of recombination, migration or any other events occurring
  during the bottleneck.
- Demography includes various population models such as splits and admixtures.
- Bottlenecks can be instantaneous or simple.
- Demography models involve time in units of 'time ago'.
- Demography uses a forwards-time convention.
- Simulations with multiple isolated populations will fail with an error because the
  lineages can never coalesce.
- The default_sampling_time value for the ancestral populations is set to the time
  of the split event.
- For trunk populations like 'A', the initially_active flag must be set if we want
  to draw samples from it at the present day.
- The version of this model in this documentation was incorrect for the specified
  dates.
- Species trees must be encoded in Newick format, with named leaves and branch lengths.
- When a species tree has branch lengths in units of years or millions of years rather
  than generations, a generation time in years must be specified.
- Msprime uses the GNU Scientific Library to generate high-quality random numbers.
- Simulations run concurrently in subprocesses will be assigned unique seeds by default.
- Simulations can be run in parallel using concurrent.futures.
- The msp ancestry and msp mutations commands write their output to stdout by default
  so make sure you redirect this to a file or use the --output option.
- Due to quirks in Python’s argparse module, negative growth rates written in exponential
  form (e.g. -eG 1.0 -1e-5) are not recognised as an option argument.
- A rate map is defined as a set of constant rates which apply piecewise over contiguous
  regions of the genome.
- All intervals are open-closed; that is, the left coordinate is inclusive and the
  right coordinate exclusive.
- Requires setup of connected app in msprime
- Some nodes may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Each individual must have exactly two parents.
- Unknown parents are indicated using -1.
- The time column may become optional in later releases.
- Often useful to visualise a (small) pedigree.
- Evaluating these log likelihoods requires knowledge of a whole ARG, rather than
  just the more compact tree sequence representation.
- Log likelihood implementations are only available for continuous genomes.
- The format of these logging messages is not fixed and may change arbitrarily in
  the future.
- Your old simulations will still work and the msprime 0.x APIs will be supported
  indefinitely.
- The only situation in which your simulation might break is if you’ve been doing
  some obscure things with genome discretisation.
- This class is deprecated (but supported indefinitely); please use the RateMap class
  in new code.
- The legacy num_loci option is no longer supported and should not be used.
- msprime can directly use nsam as sample size parameter if ploidy is specified to
  1.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The use of the C toolchain on macOS is a moving target.
- Beware of multiple versions of the python library installed by different programs.
- If you use msprime in your work, please cite the 2022 Genetics paper marking the
  1.0 release.
- If you use the Discrete Time Wright Fisher model, please cite the 2020 PLOS Genetics
  paper.
- The API has been made more Pythonic by replacing (e.g.) tree.get_parent(u) with
  tree.parent(u), and tree.get_total_branch_length() with tree.total_branch_length.
- The demography API provides debugging tools to help understand and visualise the
  demographic models.
