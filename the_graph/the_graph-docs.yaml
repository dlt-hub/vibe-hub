    the header `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` where the JWT is obtained from The Graph
    Market. Common mistakes include using an API key instead of a JWT, omitting the
    "Bearer" prefix, using an expired or incorrect token, or missing the header entirely.'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer <token>. The token should be passed in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable holds the JWT
    credential used for authentication.'

  - 'All API endpoints require JWT authentication via the Authorization header. Obtain
    a JWT token by signing up on The Graph Market and generating one from the dropdown
    menu for each API key. Include the token in every request using the header Authorization:
