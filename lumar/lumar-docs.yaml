auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.lumar.io/docs/graphql/authentication/:
  - API authentication requires a session token. Users can create an API user key
    through the Analytics Hub at accounts.lumar.io/api-access or via GraphQL API after
    logging in. The session token must be used in subsequent requests to access protected
    queries and mutations beyond the limited public endpoints.
  - API user keys are generated via GraphQL mutation or the Analytics Hub portal.
    Authentication uses the x-auth-token header with an API session token in GraphQL
    requests. The generated user key consists of an id and secret pair that can be
    used for subsequent API authentication.
  - Session token authentication is used for API requests. After signing in, you receive
    a session token valid for 30 days. Send this token in the HTTP header `x-auth-token`
    with each request to https://api.lumar.io/graphql. An invalid session token will
    return a 401 error.
  - 'The Lumar API uses GraphQL mutations for authentication. To authenticate, send
    a POST request to https://api.lumar.io/graphql with a mutation called createSessionUsingUserKey
    that accepts userKeyId and secret as variables in the request body. The mutation
    returns a token that is used for subsequent authenticated requests. Include standard
    headers like Content-Type: application/json and optionally apollographql-client-name
    and apollographql-client-version.'
- information_source; https://api-docs.lumar.io/docs/graphql/get-raw-data/:
  - 'The API requires bearer token authentication via the x-auth-token header. Include
    the header x-auth-token: YOUR_API_SESSION_TOKEN with each request to the GraphQL
    endpoint at https://api.lumar.io/graphql. The token value should be your API session
    token. Additionally, the apollographql-client-version header set to 1.0.0 is required
    with requests.'
