- BGP is a distance-vector exterior gateway protocol.
- IRP Lite is well suited for budget-conscious Service Providers and Enterprises that
  are willing to start taking advantage of automated internet route optimization.
- IRP Lite does have some limitations and restrictions.
- Noction IRP is licensed based on the network bandwidth usage, measured as monthly
  95th percentile.
- No authentication required for accessing the main website.
- Noction is a technology company with the main area of expertise in network traffic
  analysis and BGP network performance automation.
- IRP Lite continues to be offered free of charge, delivering a reliable starting
  point for BGP optimization.
- IRP can integrate with your current network monitoring systems using SNMP traps
  and a REST API.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Noction
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Set the frequency of Flow exports on network devices as frequently as possible.
  For best results export intervals should be set to 1 min or even less.
- 'NFA processes huge volumes of data and uses two databases to store all the related
  information: MySQL and ClickHouse.'
- 'The most important ClickHouse tables are: flows_data1, flows_data2, flows_data3.'
- NFA by default uses SUM aggregation functions over Packets and Octets flow metrics.
- The top 10 results are shown by default in Data Explorer and the subsequently created
  widgets.
- Supports SNMP v2c or v3 details for devices under the Inventory section.
- Allows grouping and narrowing by criteria previously set up in widgets.
- Devices must be assigned to locations/sites to enhance grouping and filtering capabilities.
- All operations with DNs (initial bind DN, group DNs, user names) are case insensitive
  and also strip redundant whitespace.
- To provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or
  access device information.
