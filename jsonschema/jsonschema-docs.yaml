notes:
- Most of the documentation for this package assumes you’re familiar with the fundamentals
  of writing JSON schemas themselves.
- Uses referencing.Registry for schema referencing
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Includes various versions of jsonschema validators.
- This version does not automatically retrieve remote references, which may affect
  integration.
- If the `cls` argument is not provided, the default validator class is the latest
  released draft.
- The specification recommends that all schemas contain [$schema] properties.
