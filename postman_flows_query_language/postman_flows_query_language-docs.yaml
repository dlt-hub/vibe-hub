- ? information_source; https://tw-2011-revise-run-button-api.learning.postman-beta.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-10/
  : - 'OAuth 1.0 authentication requires Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, and Access
      Token credentials. The signature method can be HMAC-SHA1, PLAINTEXT, or RSA.
      Authorization data is passed either in the Authorization header (prefixed with
      "OAuth") or in the request body/URL parameters depending on the request method:
      for POST/PUT with x-www-form-urlencoded body type, parameters go in the body;
      otherwise they go in URL query parameters.'
    - OAuth 1.0 is a three-legged authorization flow where a client application obtains
      an access token by exchanging a temporary token after user authorization. The
      client must provide a consumer key and secret, select a signature method (HMAC,
      PLAINTEXT, or RSA), and pass authorization details in request headers, body,
      or URL as specified.

  : - 'OAuth 2.0 is a token-based authorization framework supporting multiple grant
      types: authorization code, authorization code with PKCE, implicit, password
      credentials, and client credentials. Access tokens are obtained through the
      appropriate grant flow and sent in requests, typically via the Authorization
      header with Bearer scheme.'
    - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow with the following required parameters: Client
      ID, Client Secret, Auth URL (authorization server endpoint), Access Token URL
      (token exchange endpoint), Callback URL (redirect URI), and optional Scope (space-separated
      access scopes). Client authentication can be sent via Basic Auth header or as
      client credentials in the request body. Optional Refresh Token URL for token
      refresh, and custom parameters can be added to auth, token, or refresh requests
      via request body, URL, or headers.'
- ? information_source; https://tw-2011-revise-run-button-api.learning.postman-beta.com/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/
  : - Guided Auth supports bearer, basic, API key, and OAuth 2.0 authentication credentials.
      When set up in Postman, you can store credentials in the Postman Vault, and
      OAuth 2.0 tokens are automatically refreshed. Authentication is configured via
      the Authorization tab by selecting the Auth Type and following the recommended
      setup instructions for the specific API.
