auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.autolabproject.com/api-interface/:
  - Scope 'instructor_all' is required to access this endpoint. This indicates role-based
    authorization where only users with instructor-level permissions can retrieve
    submission scores for assessments.
  - The API requires the 'instructor_all' scope for authorization. This indicates
    OAuth2 or a similar scope-based authorization system where callers must have the
    instructor_all scope to access the assessment scores endpoints (show, update_latest,
    and list operations).
  - The client's access token should be included as a parameter to all endpoints.
    For details on obtaining access tokens, please see the API Overview documentation.
- information_source; https://docs.autolabproject.com/api-overview/:
  - Autolab API uses OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant flow for user authorization.
    All endpoints require client authentication via an access token obtained from
    the user through the standard OAuth2 authorization process.
  - This documentation describes an OAuth2 device flow for obtaining authorization
    codes. The client must pass client_id as a query parameter to GET /oauth/device_flow_init
    to obtain a device_code and user_code, then poll GET /oauth/device_flow_authorize
    with both client_id and device_code parameters until the user completes authorization
    on the verification_uri, at which point an authorization code is returned for
    exchanging to an access token.
