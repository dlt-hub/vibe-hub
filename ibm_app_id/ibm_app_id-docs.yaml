auth_info:
- information_source; https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui/swagger.json:
  - All endpoints require an IAM Token passed in the security scheme. The token must
    be provided as an IAM Token credential and is validated to ensure the user has
    appropriate permissions; users without valid IAM tokens receive a 401 response,
    and users with insufficient permissions receive a 403 response.
  - All endpoints shown require an IAM Token for authentication. The token must be
    provided in the security scheme and grants access based on user permissions; requests
    without valid tokens receive 401 responses, and insufficient permissions result
    in 403 responses.
  - An IAM token with valid permissions must be provided in the Authorization header.
    The security scheme is named "IAM Token" and is required for all endpoints shown
    (get and put operations on user profiles, and token revocation). No other auth
    methods, scopes, or token acquisition details are specified in this documentation
    chunk.
  - App ID Access Token is required in the security scheme. Send the access token
    in the Authorization header as a bearer token to authenticate requests to the
    user info endpoint. A 401 response indicates an expired, revoked, or malformed
    token, and a 403 response indicates insufficient scope for the requested operation.
  - App ID uses multiple authentication schemes depending on the API type. For runtime
    APIs (Profiles), provide a valid App ID access token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <access_token>". For Management APIs, provide a Cloud IAM access token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer [token]". Alternatively, use basic authentication
    with client ID and secret (obtainable from App ID console service credentials)
    for some endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui/swagger.json:
  - 'Pagination is controlled by two query parameters: start-index (starting position)
    and count (number of results per page). The response returns user data as a JSON
    object following RFC 7643 format, though specific pagination response fields are
    not detailed in this excerpt.'
  - The export endpoint uses start-index and countExport query parameters for pagination.
    The response returns up to 50 users per request. Use start-index to specify the
    starting position and countExport to control the number of results returned in
    each request.
