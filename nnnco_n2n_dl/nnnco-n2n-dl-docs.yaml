notes:
- N2N DL ingests, transforms, enriches and is able to push information from a multitude
  of devices and networks.
- API key is needed for access.
- LoRaWAN device enrollment requires access to 1 or more master groups.
- Your account must be enabled for device enrolment otherwise an HTTP error 400 will
  be returned.
- Class B devices cannot be enrolled through APIs yet.
- Delivery queue has a fixed maximum length of 50k items and is autorotating.
- You are currently limited to customMeta objects with maximum 50 keys but this is
  a soft limit that can be increased if necessary.
- N2N DL supports a MQTT connection option to send and receive messages from LoRaWAN
  devices using a permanent MQTT Connection
- 'IMPORTANT: You can download certificate and its private key only once on this page
  for a newly created certificate.'
- If you lost the certificate, you will need to create a new one. You cannot restore
  the lost certificate.
- Payloads can have a variable number of channels from reading to reading.
- Multiple readings from multiple devices can be ingested at once up to a 100kb limit
  per single HTTP request.
- Timestamps are specified in milliseconds past Epoch (1/1/1970).
- Historical data can be ingested with a timestamp greater than 1262217600000 only.
- Data can be ingested out of order and will be automatically merged and deduped.
- Data cannot be deleted once ingested at this stage but can be overwritten.
- Every requests to ingest data either succeeds completely or fails. No partial data
  ingestion can occur.
- Custom LoraParser takes precedence over built-in decoders.
- N-tag application may take around 5 minutes to create/change the N-tag locations
  after changes in base station metadata.
- It is better to treat ntag-location values as string IDs.
- It will take around 5 minutes for the application to react on the new changes.
- If an N-tag stops sending uplinks, there is a chance that it left the location.
- The nature of LoRaWAN assumes that some number of uplinks may be missed due to LoRaWAN
  network conditions.
- Requires API access to N2N DL on the root enterprise level nnn with admin permissions.
- A base64 encoded N2N DL API key and ‘any’ username for basic authentication must
  be provided.
