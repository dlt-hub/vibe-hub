notes:
- Supports real-time calendar synchronization.
- API access requires proper authorization setup.
- Support is provided in English, but the Cronofy support team will do their best
  to support other languages if required.
- Public Links allow anyone to book an event with you according to your Preferences.
- Public Links are mostly useful when you need to bulk schedule.
- Invites will expire after 48 hours.
- Only users with 'owner' role can invite or delete users.
- Domain Sign Up allows any coworkers who share your email domain to join your OU.
- Selection Rules and Templates need to be created separately.
- Selection Rules describe a pool of people from your Organizational Unit.
- Scheduler Workflows allow you to integrate the Scheduler into your business workflows
  and applications.
- Callback notifications are available for all Step types.
- Notification types include scheduling_request_time_chosen, scheduling_request_rescheduled,
  scheduling_request_declined, scheduling_request_no_times_available, scheduling_request_more_times_requested,
  event_participant_status_changed, event_start, event_end.
- Constraints allow you to set a maximum number of events of a given type that a user
  can be booked for.
- Ideal for situations where privacy and data control is paramount.
- You will need to enable multi-factor authentication for your account if you haven’t
  done so already.
- As of June 15 2017, Apple required that all applications use app-specific passwords
  when connecting to iCloud services.
- Users must provide Exchange email and password for authorization
- Public URL of Exchange server may be required for connection
- Cronofy requests scopes such as User.Read and Calendars.ReadWrite when connecting
  via Graph.
- For EWS, Cronofy requests offline_access, openid, email, profile, User.Read, and
  EWS.AccessAsUser.All.
- Zoom requires the Zoom account to be on a paid plan (Zoom Pro or above); free Zoom
  accounts cannot be accessed by applications such as Cronofy.
- Uses OAuth2 for account access.
- Free/Busy only access is not available through the Microsoft Graph API, as the Graph
  API permissions model requires full read access even for free/busy mode.
- ApplicationImpersonation was deprecated by Microsoft, which stopped EWS Service
  Accounts from successfully syncing M365 calendars.
- Free/Busy-only, Individual Connect, and on-premise Exchange connections are unaffected.
- Cronofy requires full mailbox access for creating and updating events.
- Cronofy is a hosted calendar synchronization and scheduling API with companion UI
  Elements.
- Workflow Triggers comprise a suite of features that enable developers to use calendar
  and event data to drive application and business workflows.
- Push notifications aren’t enabled for Personal Tokens as they have to be linked
  to an Application.
- Application must respond within 5 seconds for the push notification to be considered
  successful.
- You will not receive any Push Notifications from changes resulting from an API call.
- Supports authorization via user accounts for Zoom, GoToMeeting, etc.
- Confirmation email is sent to verify the connection of conferencing services.
- iCloud calendars do not send responses when a recipient accepts or declines an invite.
- Calendar providers do not send responses when a recipient deletes an event on their
  calendar.
- The browser extension requires hidden markup to pass relevant contact information.
- Developer accounts need to be created for each data center you want to use.
- Functionally the APIs are identical.
- Cronofy can request more granular permissions than EWS, leading to less friction
  in administrator consent
- Cronofy can use Teams conferencing as an integrated conferencing provider, with
  no additional end-user authorization required
- Cronofy specifies all event times in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
- The specified timezone does not change when the event is occurring.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication with access tokens.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Cronofy
