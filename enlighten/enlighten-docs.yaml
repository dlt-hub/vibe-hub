notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Windows does not currently support resizing.
- Jupyter Notebook support is provided by the NotebookManager class.
- The PyCharm Python console is currently not supported because sys.stdout does not
  reference a valid TTY.
- The status bar is only updated when StatusBar.update() or StatusBar.refresh() is
  called, so fields like elapsed will need additional calls to appear dynamic.
- Status bar is only updated when StatusBar.update() or StatusBar.refresh() is called
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
