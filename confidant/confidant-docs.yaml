auth_info:
- information_source; https://lyft.github.io/confidant/api.html:
  - Authentication is required for all API endpoints. The allowed authentication types
    (kmsauth, SAML, OAuth, etc.) depend on your Confidant configuration and RBAC settings.
    Refer to the configuration and RBAC documentation for specific details on which
    auth methods are enabled and how to use them.
  - The API uses SAML-based authentication. Requests to protected endpoints (like
    GET /v1/user/email) require the user to be authenticated via SAML login at GET
    /v1/saml/login. Authentication state is maintained through the user session, and
    unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints will redirect to the SAML login
    page.
  - The API uses SAML-based authentication. Users must be authenticated via SAML (endpoints
    include /v1/saml/metadata, /v1/saml/consume, and /v1/saml/logout), and endpoints
    like POST /v1/user/email require an authenticated session. Authorization is enforced
    via permissions checks, returning 403 Forbidden when the client lacks required
    permissions.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://lyft.github.io/confidant/api.html:
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter (required, integer) to specify items per
    page. The response includes a next_page field that is null when there are no more
    pages; use the next_page value to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses an optional next_page query parameter. When paged results are
    returned, pass the next_page value from the response as the next_page query parameter
    in the subsequent request to fetch the next page.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination for the GET /v1/credentials endpoint. The
    next_page query parameter accepts a string value from a previous response to fetch
    the next page of results. Stop paginating when next_page is not returned in the
    response.
  - The endpoint uses offset-based pagination with a next_page query parameter. To
    fetch the next page of results, pass the next_page value returned in the response
    as the next_page query parameter in the subsequent request. When next_page is
    null, all results have been retrieved.
  - The response includes a next_page field set to null, indicating pagination support
    where null signals the end of results. However, no request parameters for controlling
    pagination (such as page, limit, offset, or cursor) are documented in the provided
    excerpt.
