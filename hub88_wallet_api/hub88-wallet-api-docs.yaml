notes:
- RSA-SHA256 is used to sign the request body using the private key.
- Hub88 provides a unique experience and selection of games funnelled to you with
  just one integration.
- Operators can set custom Big Win thresholds starting from €1,000 / 50x.
- Global thresholds remain monitored by Hub88 Support.
- The entire data exchange flow goes through Hub88, because of this it's essential
  that an integration to either Operator API or Supplier API is built dependent on
  the use-case.
- cursors are encoded strings. You should not decode or alter them.
- if next_cursor is missing from the response, it indicates that there are no more
  results.
- similarly, if previous_cursor is absent, you are at the start of the dataset.
- Hub88 verifies all Games API requests using the public key provided by the Operator.
- The signature must match the body exactly—any difference will result in an 'invalid
  signature' error.
- Requests have to be idempotent. All transactions contain a `transaction_uuid` field.
- All Games API requests have to be signed by Operator.
- Wallet API requests have to be idempotent.
- Operator needs to provide corresponding endpoints based on the API structures.
- In case of network fail (HTTP 502, timeout, nxdomain, etc.), we will retry 3 times
  with 1 sec of timeout.
- At least one of the filters `start_time` or `end_time` must be included for the
  request to be valid.
- Maximum 100 users can be added in bulk rewards.
- OnDemand API is a specialized API available upon request.
- The proxy endpoint(s) are available by request, please contact your account manager.
- Request signing in Supplier API requires RSA-SHA256 and BASE64 encoding.
- Requests must contain a request_uuid field for idempotency.
- Only authenticated Operators and Suppliers can access the assistant.
- Hub AI supports all major languages of Hub88’s operator and supplier markets.
- HubConnect is a unified self-service platform designed to streamline your business
  operations with real-time data insights, dedicated support, and efficient management.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Ensure the email address uses your company domain and is actively maintained.
- Email notifications for case updates are sent to the address linked to your HubConnect
  account.
- HubConnect Supplier Zone is a self-service platform designed to give suppliers autonomy,
  transparency, and efficiency in their partnership with Hub88 and operator-partners.
- Data performance is updated daily at 00:00 UTC.
- Direct access to operator-partners is essential for a successful game launch.
- Operator Backoffice provides a clear view of your key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Hub88 automatically handles game releases and deprecations.
- KPI dashboard metrics include free money (e.g., bonuses). To see total numbers without
  free money, use Reports views.
- This may cause differences between the two views.
- Reports can be downloaded in CSV format.
- The Transactions area allows filtering by various attributes such as timeframe,
  operator, brand, site, game, currency, amount range, status, transaction kind, and
  supplier.
- Transactions are flagged automatically by the system based on operator response
  failures or big wins.
- Flagged transactions are retained for 30 days after the flag was applied.
- Operators often require more granular control. For example, €5,000 might be a big
  win for one operator but not another. Custom thresholds allow proactive fraud monitoring
  at an operator level.
- 'Minimum values for custom threshold are: €1,000 (amount) and 50x (ratio).'
- Thresholds apply globally per your operator account.
- Only one active set is supported.
- A Big Win occurs when a player receives a payout significantly larger than their
  stake, often from slots, bonus rounds, or jackpots.
- 'A win is automatically flagged as a Big Win if it meets both of the following conditions:
  Win amount is greater than €40,000; Win-to-bet ratio exceeds 350x.'
- Rewards are incentives such as cash bonuses, free spins, or loyalty points.
- A reward can only belong to one campaign at a time.
- A campaign cannot mix Casino and Sportsbook rewards.
- Campaigns can be both Casino and Sportsbook type.
- Refers to the whole entity on Hub88's side.
- A Brand represents the overarching organisation or label under which one or more
  operators function.
- Segments are page-specific and are only visible on the page where they were created.
- Global thresholds remain in place and continue to be automatically monitored by
  Hub88 Support
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Sportsbook rewards and campaigns can only be created through Operator Backoffice,
  not through API.
- Segments persist across sessions and work securely with user permissions.
- Flags stay visible for 30 days, or disappear if the issue is resolved.
- Operators can set custom Big Win thresholds for both amount and win-to-bet ratio,
  starting from €1,000 / 50x.

- No results returned? You may have paged beyond the last item. Try using previous_cursor
  instead.
- Invalid cursor? Ensure you are using the exact next_cursor or previous_cursor returned
  by the API. Do not modify it.
- Unexpected limit behaviour? Remember that limits outside the 50–100 range will be
  automatically adjusted.
