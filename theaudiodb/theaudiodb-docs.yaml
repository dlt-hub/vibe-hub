auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php:
  - 'API key required in URL path. The API key is placed as a path segment in the
    URL structure: www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/{APIKEY}/endpoint. Example shows
    {APIKEY} placeholder that must be replaced with an actual API key value. One example
    uses "2" as a test key with limited functionality (coldplay test only).'
  - The API requires an API key passed as a path parameter in the URL structure /api/v1/json/{APIKEY}/
    before the endpoint name. The APIKEY placeholder must be replaced with an actual
    API key value in all requests.
- information_source; https://www.theaudiodb.com/free_music_api:
  - API key authentication is used for both v1 and v2. V1 requires a numeric API key
    appended to the URL path (e.g., /123/ for the free key or your premium key), while
    V2 requires the API key to be sent in the request header. The free API key is
    123, and premium keys are available on your user profile after upgrading.
  - The API key "123" must be included in the URL path as the first parameter after
    the domain and API version (e.g., `/api/v1/json/{api_key}/endpoint.php`). This
    is a free API key used for all requests shown in the examples.
  - 'TheAudioDB API uses two authentication approaches: v1 uses a free test key (123)
    or premium API key passed as a URL path segment (e.g., https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE/search.php),
    while v2 requires the API key in the X-API-KEY header.'
