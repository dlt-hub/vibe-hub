  : - Dartfish TV API uses temporary channel keys obtained by authenticating with
      an admin account at dartfish.tv via the Swagger interface (https://api.dartfish.tv/swagger/index.html).
      Users must click Authorize to log in, then click Access and provide the channel
      ID to retrieve the temporary key, which is then used in PowerBI requests. The
      temporary key approach replaced permanent keys for security reasons to ensure
      only authorized personnel can access the API.

  : - The API uses temporary channel keys obtained through authenticated login to
      dartfish.tv. To get the key, authenticate via the Swagger UI at https://api.dartfish.tv/swagger/index.html
      by clicking "Authorize", then click "Access" and enter the channel ID to retrieve
      a temporary key with limited lifetime. Use this temporary key in API V2 requests
      (e.g., /api/v2/Channel/{channelId}/HomeLink). The permanent key from API V1
      is deprecated and will stop working after December 31, 2022.

    click Authorize, then click Access and enter the channel ID to retrieve the temporary
    key. Include this key in API requests to authenticate access to dartfish.tv channel
    data. The key has a limited lifetime and replaces the previous permanent channel
    key. API endpoints follow the format /api/v2/Channel/{channelId}/resource.

      Authorize, then Access, entering the channel ID, and using the returned temporary
      channel key in PowerBI queries to the new RelativePath="/api/v2/video/" endpoint.
