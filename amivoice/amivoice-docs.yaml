  - 'To issue a one-time APPKEY, send a POST request to https://acp-api.amivoice.com/issue_service_authorization
    with the required parameters: sid (ServiceID), spw (ServicePassword), epi (expiration
    time in seconds), and optionally ipa (IP address ranges). The response returns
    a one-time APPKEY that must be set as the authorization key in subsequent request
    parameters. The APPKEY expires at the time specified by epi and will cause authentication
    to fail if used after expiration.'

  - The API requires an application key for authentication. For the HTTP interface,
    pass the app key using the `u` parameter in the POST request (e.g., `-F u={YOUR_APPKEY}`).
    For the WebSocket interface, pass it using the `authorization` parameter in the
    command line (e.g., `authorization={YOUR_APPKEY}`).

  - To obtain a one-time APPKEY for the AmiVoice API, send a POST request to https://acp-api.amivoice.com/issue_service_authorization
    with required parameters sid (Service ID) and spw (Service Password) from MyPage
    connection information. Optional parameters include epi for expiration period
    (default 30000 milliseconds) and ipa to restrict by source IP address. The Service
    Password differs from the MyPage login password.
- information_source; https://docs.amivoice.com/en/amivoice-api/manual/request-parameters:
  - Authorization information is required and must be provided as the "authorization"
    parameter. The documentation indicates this is authentication information but
    does not specify the exact format, header name, or how to construct the authorization
    value in the provided excerpt.
- information_source; https://docs.amivoice.com/amivoice-api/manual/async-http-interface:
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token in the Authorization header. Include `Authorization:
    Bearer {APPKEY}` in requests to the recognition results endpoint, where APPKEY
    is your application key obtained during job creation.'
