  - The HTTP transport supports optional API key authentication. If the `auth` dictionary
    is provided with `type` set to `api_key`, the `apiKey` value is sent as a Bearer
    token in the Authorization HTTP header. The `auth` parameter is optional and defaults
    to no authorization.

  - The HTTP transport uses optional API key authentication. If authentication is
    configured, set the `auth` dictionary with `type` set to `api_key` and provide
    the `apiKey` string value, which is sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    HTTP header. Alternatively, you can specify a fully qualified class name of a
    custom TokenProvider as the `type`.
  - The async transport API supports optional Bearer token authentication via API
    key. Configure authentication by setting the `auth` dictionary with `type` set
    to `"api_key"` and providing the `apiKey` string value, which will be sent as
    the Authorization HTTP header with Bearer scheme. Alternatively, you can specify
    a fully qualified class name for a custom TokenProvider implementation.
- information_source; https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/spark/configuration/transport/:
  - 'The authentication is configured through an optional `auth` dictionary with two
    required properties when used: `type` (set to "api_key" or a fully qualified TokenProvider
    class name) and `apiKey` (a string value sent as the Bearer token in the Authorization
    HTTP header). If no `auth` is provided, the connection is anonymous.'
