notes:
- Supports Basic Auth, API Key, and JWT authentication methods.
- Supports listing, creating, updating, and deleting tunnels and logs.
- Webhook Relay Functions can be reused by multiple Inputs and Outputs.
- Webhook Relay requires setup of connected app in API
- Host header verification is a common feature on web servers.
- Avoids modifying your local web server or framework settings.
- Webhook Relay provides a dedicated static outgoing IP address for all webhooks and
  requests forwarded through your tunnels.
- 'Eliminate Complex Setup: No need to create or manage Load Balancers or Ingress
  controllers just for receiving webhooks.'
- 'Enhanced Security: Keep your Kubernetes services private. No need to expose services
  directly to the internet.'
- Webhook Relay provides both subscription services and free services up to 150 Webhooks
  only.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Webhook Relay Functions provide an easy way to extract values from webhooks and
  transform HTTP requests before passing them to their final destination.
errors:
- '404: Tunnel not found'
- '200: Successful Response'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
