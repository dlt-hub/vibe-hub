auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.flippingbook.com/:
  - API keys are required for authentication. Generate and manage API keys at https://logon.flippingbook.com/myaccesstoken
    on your FlippingBook account. Each account can have a maximum of 10 API keys,
    and all API actions are recorded and audited.
  - API keys are used for authentication via the HTTP Bearer authorization scheme
    in the Authorization header, or alternatively via an accessToken parameter (query
    or request body). To create or manage API keys, you must provide either an existing
    API key as a Bearer token or an accessToken from FlippingBook's single sign-on
    service.
  - All publicly available APIs require HTTP bearer authentication. Include an Authorization
    header with the value "Bearer <your API key>" in every request. API keys are obtained
    from the Help Center or generated via the Key Management API, and are linked to
    your FlippingBook account for audit purposes.
  - The API requires an API key for authentication, sent via an HTTP Authorization
    header. Missing or invalid authorization headers result in 401 errors, while an
    invalid API key produces a 403 error. Rate limiting is enforced per API key, allowing
    up to ten consecutive requests before being throttled to one request per second.
  - The API uses API key authentication. The accessToken parameter is a string that
    serves as the API key credential. API keys can be managed via the auth endpoints
    (generated, rotated, and revoked at DELETE /api/v1/auth/key), indicating the key
    is used to authenticate requests to the FlippingBook Online API.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.flippingbook.com/:
  - Results are paginated by 10 publications by default. Use the `count` query parameter
    (max 1000) to increase results per page, or use the `offset` query parameter to
    fetch subsequent pages. The response includes a `total` field indicating the total
    number of publications available.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters count (number of links
    per page) and offset (starting position). The response structure is not fully
    shown in the provided text, so the exact pagination fields in the response cannot
    be determined from this excerpt.
