notes:
- Webhooks are retried until they are successfully delivered – with an exponential
  backoff to avoid overwhelming your webhook endpoint.
- The delay is capped at 5th retry attempt.
- Make sure to keep this secret safe by only storing it in a secure environment variable
  (e.g. DOCK_WEBHOOK_SECRET). Do not commit it to git or add it in any client-side
  code.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Webhook events are triggered for various actions in the workspace.
- Use this key to authenticate requests on your server.
- Dock API rate limiting is in conformance with the IETF standard
- Once an authenticated embed url is generated it remains valid for 2 minutes.
- Don’t expose this key on a website.
- Dock API rate limiting is in conformance with the IETF standard.
