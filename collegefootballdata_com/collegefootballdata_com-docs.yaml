  : - The CFBD GraphQL API uses Bearer Token authentication. Include your API key
      in the Authorization header as a Bearer token by selecting "Bearer Token" from
      the Auth dropdown in Insomnia and pasting your API key in the Token field without
      any prefix. The same API key used for the CFBD REST API works for GraphQL requests.

  - Authentication for the CFBD API uses bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization
    header in requests with the value "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", where YOUR_API_KEY is
    obtained by registering at collegefootballdata.com. When using the cfbd Python
    library, pass the key as the access_token parameter in the Configuration object.

    token is the same API key used for the REST API, obtained by registering at https://collegefootballdata.com/key.
    Access requires a Patreon Tier 3 or higher subscription, and keys are autogenerated
    and emailed upon subscription (syncing can take up to 15 minutes). Send the header
    as Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>.'
