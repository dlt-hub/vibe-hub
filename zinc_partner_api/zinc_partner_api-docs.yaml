auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.zincwork.com/:
  - All calls to the Partner API require an API key passed in the Authorization header,
    which must be connected to a valid customer account on Zinc to associate requests
    with that account. API keys are created in the sandbox account and used for authentication.
  - The Partner API uses Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header.
    Pass your API key as "Bearer API_KEY" in the Authorization header, where API_KEY
    is obtained from the Zinc platform at https://app.zincwork.com/company/general
    and must be associated with a valid customer account. For webhooks, contact Zinc
    to receive a unique signing token used to verify webhook signatures via HMAC comparison
    against the webhook payload.
