auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.apify.com/api:
  - 'The Apify API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>" for all requests.
    The official JavaScript and Python clients accept the token via a token parameter
    in their configuration.'
- information_source; https://docs.apify.com/api/v2:
  - Apify API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the `Authorization`
    header as `Bearer <token>` (recommended), or alternatively as a `token` query
    parameter in the request URL (less secure). The token is obtained from the Apify
    Console integrations section.
  - Authentication token is required; send it in the Authorization header as a bearer
    token. The API returns a 401 error if the token is not provided. Rate limits are
    counted per user for authenticated requests and per IP address for unauthenticated
    requests.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required, sent in the Authorization header as
    "Authorization: Bearer your_token". Alternatively, API key authentication using
    the apiKey parameter is supported.'
  - The Apify API uses a secret API token for authentication. The token is obtained
    from your account settings (https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) and
    is used by the SDK to authenticate requests when running Actors. The token determines
    which account the Actor runs under and is required for API calls via the Run Actor,
    Run task, Get run, Get items, and Get record endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.apify.com/api/v2:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter has a maximum
    value that can change, so check responses. Responses include data.total (total
    records), data.offset (current offset), data.limit (requested limit), data.count
    (returned items), and data.items (the records). Use offset and limit values from
    the response to construct subsequent requests until all records are retrieved.
- information_source; https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/getting-started:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (default 100, number of items
    to retrieve) and offset (default 0, pagination offset) in the GET datasets/:datasetId/items
    endpoint. Increment offset by the limit value to retrieve subsequent pages until
    fewer items than the limit are returned.
- information_source; https://docs.apify.com/academy/api-scraping/general-api-scraping/handling-pagination:
  - Page-number pagination uses incrementing page numbers in request URL parameters
    or body to retrieve successive result sets. Offset pagination uses limit parameter
    for result count and offset parameter to skip records. Cursor pagination uses
    a cursor marker from the dataset to identify position, advancing through results
    by using the cursor value from the previous response in the next request.
