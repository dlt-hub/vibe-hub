  - EDI API requires an API key for authentication, passed as an HTTP header named
    Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key with your API key as the value. Obtain your API key
    from https://www.edination.com/account.html and keep it secure.
- information_source; https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/articles/7745692421521-What-is-Inhouse-EDI-API:
  - The InHouse API uses an API key for authentication with the Auth API and cloud
    EdiNation services. The same API key is used for both the Auth API and cloud EdiNation,
    with a limit of 10 operations per day for cloud EdiNation. The API key should
    be sent in requests to the Auth API, though the exact header or parameter name
    is not specified in this documentation. The API can operate offline without Auth
    API calls if the token and models are manually installed locally. Rate limiting
    returns 429 Too Many Requests, and quota exceeded returns 403 Forbidden.
  - To use the InHouse API, you need an API key obtained from your EdiNation account
    after signing up. Every InHouse API method requires an API key parameter where
    you include your key. The API key is validated against an Auth API endpoint, which
    returns a token valid for 30 days; the token is automatically refreshed a few
    days before expiration. The Auth API URL must be set via the EDINATION_AUTHAPI_URL
    environment variable, and external HTTP GET calls to https://api.edination.com/v2
    must be allowed.
