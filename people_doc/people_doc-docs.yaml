auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc.people-doc.com/client/auth/oauth.html:
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. Use HTTP Basic Authentication with your APPLICATION_ID
    and APPLICATION_SECRET to POST to the token endpoint and obtain an OAuth token.
    The CLIENT_ID is also needed as a prerequisite credential from the IPM team.
  - OAuth2 token-based authentication with token renewal and revocation capabilities.
    Tokens expire as indicated by the expires_in attribute in the response. To revoke
    a token, POST to the /api/v2/client/revoke_token endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth
    with APPLICATION_ID and APPLICATION_SECRET as credentials, and include the token
    parameter in the request body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data. When
    tokens expire, request a new one using the OAuth token request flow.
  - UKG HR Service Delivery uses OAuth 2.0 with client credentials grant type. To
    authenticate, send a POST request with Basic Authentication using APPLICATION_ID
    and APPLICATION_SECRET to the /api/v2/client/tokens endpoint with grant_type=client_credentials,
    scope=client, and client_id parameters. The response contains an access_token
    with token_type "bearer" and expires_in seconds; use this bearer token in the
    Authorization header for all subsequent API calls.
  - UKG HR Service Delivery uses bearer token authentication. Include the access_token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" with all API requests. The
    token has an expiration time specified in seconds via the expires_in field, and
    you should implement a refresh mechanism to renew the token before it expires
    to avoid breaking your API flow.
- information_source; https://doc.people-doc.com/client/guides/datasets/index.html:
  - Authorization uses OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer $OAUTHTOKEN" where $OAUTHTOKEN is replaced with an actual OAuth
    access token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://doc.people-doc.com/client/api/index-v2.html:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation via the cursor query parameter. Response
    headers include Next-Cursor and Previous-Cursor values, and a Link header following
    RFC 5988 with rel="previous" and rel="next" links containing the cursor values
    for constructing subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the starting position (default 0), and limit specifies the maximum number of results
    per page (default 25, maximum 100). Responses include total field indicating total
    available results, and has_more boolean indicating if additional pages exist.
- information_source; https://doc.people-doc.com/client/api/peopledoc/sign.html:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a page GET parameter (optional) that
    returns 20 results per page. The documentation does not specify response fields
    indicating total pages, next page, or when to stop paginating, so the exact stopping
    condition is unclear from the provided text.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with next_page and prev_page fields in the
    response containing full URLs to the next and previous pages. The page parameter
    is passed as a query string parameter (e.g., page=2, page=3). Stop paginating
    when next_page is null or absent.
