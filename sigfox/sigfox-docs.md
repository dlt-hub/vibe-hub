In this guide, we'll set up a complete Sigfox data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector, like in the partial example code below:

```python-outcome
@dlt.source
def sigfox_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.sigfox.com/v2/devices/bulk",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
        },
        "resources": [
            "suspend", "unsubscribe"
        ],
    }
    [...]
    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    # Connect to destination
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='sigfox_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='sigfox_data', 
    )
    # Load the data
    load_info = pipeline.run(sigfox_source())
    print(load_info) 
```

### Why use dltHub Workspace with LLM Context to generate Python pipelines?

- Accelerate pipeline development with AI-native context
- Debug pipelines, validate schemas and data with the integrated **Pipeline Dashboard**
- Build Python notebooks for end users of your data
- **Low maintenance** thanks to Schema evolution with type inference, resilience and self documenting REST API connectors. A shallow learning curve makes the pipeline easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses, bringing mature data loading to pythonic Iceberg with or without catalogs

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from sigfox‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- **Documentation Endpoints**: 
  - `/v2/doc.yaml`: Provides API documentation in YAML format.
  - `/v2/doc.json`: Provides API documentation in JSON format.

- **Tile Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/tiles/monarch/kmz`: Serves KMZ files for Monarch tiles.
  - `/v2/tiles/public-coverage`: Provides public coverage tiles.
  - `/v2/tiles/monarch`: General endpoint for Monarch tiles.

- **Device Management Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/devices/{id}`: Accesses a specific device by its ID.
  - `/v2/devices`: Manages the collection of devices.
  - `/v2/devices/bulk`: Allows bulk operations on devices.
  - `/v2/devices/bulk/unsubscribe/{jobId}`: Unsubscribes a bulk job by ID.
  - `/v2/devices/bulk/replace`: Replaces devices in bulk.
  - `/v2/devices/bulk/resume`: Resumes a bulk job.
  - `/v2/devices/bulk/restart`: Restarts a bulk job.

- **Profile Management Endpoints**: 
  - `/v2/profiles/{id}`: Accesses a specific profile by its ID.

- **Group Management Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/groups`: Manages groups within the system.

- **Base Station Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/base-stations/{id}`: Accesses a specific base station by its ID.

- **Coverage Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/coverages/operators/redundancy`: Provides redundancy information for coverage operators.
  - `/v2/coverages/global/predictions/bulk`: Handles bulk predictions for global coverage.

- **Device Type Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/device-types`: Manages device types.
  - `/v2/device-types/project-id:{id}`: Accesses device types related to a specific project.

- **Operator Endpoints**:
  - `/v2/operators/{id}`: Accesses a specific operator by its ID.

You will then debug the Sigfox pipeline using our Pipeline Dashboard tool to ensure it is copying the data correctly, before building a Notebook to explore your data and build reports.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - We suggest using a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started!

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Set up `dlt` Workspace**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install "dlt[workspace]"
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Sigfox support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:sigfox duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup the necessary files and folders for the next step.
    
2. ü§† **Start LLM-assisted coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a prompt to get you started:
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Sigfox API, as specified in @sigfox-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints suspend and unsubscribe and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in sigfox_pipeline.py and name the pipeline sigfox_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python sigfox_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Set up credentials** 
    
    To access the Sigfox API, you need an API user login and password for authentication, which can be managed in the Sigfox Portal; the authentication uses the HTTP Basic scheme, and all communications must be conducted over HTTPS.
    
    To get the appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://support.sigfox.com/docs/api-documentation.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python sigfox_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly, you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline sigfox load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset sigfox_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/sigfox.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **Debug your pipeline and data with the Pipeline Dashboard**

    Now that you have a running pipeline, you need to make sure it‚Äôs correct, so you do not introduce silent failures like misconfigured pagination or incremental loading errors. By launching the dlt Workspace Pipeline Dashboard, you can see various information about the pipeline to enable you to test it. Here you can see:
    - Pipeline overview: State, load metrics
    - Data‚Äôs schema: tables, columns, types, hints
    - You can query the data itself
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline sigfox_pipeline show dashboard
    ```
    
6. üêç **Build a Notebook with data explorations and reports**

    With the pipeline and data partially validated, you can continue with custom data explorations and reports. To get started, paste the snippet below into a new marimo Notebook and ask your LLM to go from there. Jupyter Notebooks and regular Python scripts are supported as well.

    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("sigfox_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "suspend" table as Pandas frame
   data."suspend".df().head()
    ```
