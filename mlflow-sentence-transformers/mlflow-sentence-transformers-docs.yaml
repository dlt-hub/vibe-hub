notes:
- Model deployment to AWS Sagemaker can currently be performed via the mlflow.sagemaker
  module.
- Model deployment to Azure can be performed by using the azureml library.
- Provide a health check endpoint to ensure the application is responsive
- Provide an endpoint to query the version of mlflow running on the server
- The `sentence_transformers` flavor is in active development and is marked as Experimental.
- MLflow Authentication provides secure access control for experiments and registered
  models through HTTP basic authentication.
- The secret key must be consistent across multiple servers to prevent validation
  errors.
- Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Store credentials securely using environment variables or secure credential files
- Autologging captures comprehensive information about your training process automatically.
- MLflow automatically creates a parent run containing the overall search results
  and child runs for each parameter combination, making it easy to analyze which parameters
  work best.
- Use aliases for production serving by pointing to @champion or @production aliases
  instead of hard-coding version numbers.
- The ‘sentence_transformers’ MLflow Models integration is known to be compatible
  with `2.3.1` <= `sentence-transformers` <= `5.1.2`.
- Logging Sentence Transformers models with custom code is supported in MLflow 2.12.0
  and above.
- The ‘sentence_transformers’ MLflow Models integration is known to be compatible
  with `2.3.1` <= `sentence-transformers` <= `5.1.2`. MLflow Models integrations with
  sentence_transformers may not succeed when used with package versions outside of
  this range.
- Saving Sentence Transformers models with custom code (i.e. models that require `trust_remote_code=True`)
  is supported in MLflow 2.12.0 and above.
- The basic auth app requires a secret key for CSRF protection.
- It is recommended that you update the default admin password as soon as possible
  after creation.
- Admin users have unrestricted access to all MLflow resources.
- Basic authentication requires setting MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME and MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD.
- Default authentication uses HTTP basic auth
- To connect to a centralized database, set the database_uri configuration variable
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck credentials or server URL'
- '403 Permission Denied: Check user permissions using get_experiment_permission or
  get_registered_model_permission'
- '401 Authentication Failed: Verify username/password and ensure user exists in the
  system'
- 'Database Connection Issues: Verify database_uri in configuration and ensure database
  is accessible'
- '403 Forbidden: Required permission not granted.'
- '403 Forbidden: Required permission not granted'
- '401: Unauthorized'
