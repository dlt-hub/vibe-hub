  - 'JWTBearer authentication is required. Send a JWT token in the Authorization header

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.talentapi.com:
  - Pagination uses continuation_token in the request body (optional) and limit parameter
    (required, range 1..100) to control page size. The response includes a continuation_token
    field to retrieve the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses limit and continuation_token parameters in the request body. The
    limit parameter specifies the number of results to return (range 1 to some maximum),
    and continuation_token is a string used to retrieve subsequent pages. Use the
    continuation_token from a previous response to fetch the next set of results.
  - Pagination uses page_size (integer, in request body) to specify result count per
    page, continuation_token (string, in request body) to retrieve subsequent pages,
    and order_by (enum, in request body) to control result ordering. The response
    includes a continuation_token field to fetch the next page.
  - Pagination uses page_size (integer, optional, default 20) and continuation_token
    (string, optional) in the request body. The response includes continuation_token
    (string) to retrieve the next page and num_total_results (integer) for total count.
    Continue paginating by passing the returned continuation_token in the next request;
    stop when continuation_token is absent or null.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with optional cursor support. Request parameters
    include page_size (integer, default/range not specified), pagination_offset (integer),
    and continuation_token (string). Response includes continuation_token (for cursor-based
    navigation), num_total_results (total count), and num_results (current page count).
    Use continuation_token from response in next request's continuation_token parameter,
    or increment pagination_offset for offset-based navigation.
