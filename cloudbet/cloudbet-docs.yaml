- information_source; https://www.cloudbet.com/api/:
  - 'API Key authentication is required for all Feed API requests. The API Key must
    be included in the HTTP header `X-API-Key: <API Key>` where the key is a JWT token
    obtained from the Affiliate API Token page. The token has an expiration timestamp
    (`Expires at`) and must be regenerated before expiry. Affiliate API Keys may result
    in cached responses up to 1 minute behind real-time, while Trading API Keys provide
    real-time updates.'
  - The Cloudbet API uses API key authentication. The API key must be sent in the
    `X-API-Key` header with each request. Replace `<API Key>` with your actual API
    key value in the header.
  - The Cloudbet Feed API uses a long-lived JWT-format API Key for authentication.
    Send the API Key in the Authorization header as a bearer token. Obtain the key
    from your Cloudbet Player account (Trading API) or Cloudbet Affiliate account
    (Affiliate API) via the respective API sections, and note the expiration timestamp
    provided.

    The exact method of passing the API Key (header name, query parameter, or request
    body field) is not specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
