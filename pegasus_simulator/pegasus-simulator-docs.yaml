notes:
- Tested with Isaac Sim 5.1.0 release on Ubuntu 22.04LTS
- This extension was not tested on Windows
- This extension was not tested on Windows.
- You can NOT import other omniverse modules before instantiating the SimulationApp,
  otherwise the simulation crashes before the window it’s even open.
- We have tested Pegasus Simulator with Isaac Sim 5.1.0 release on Ubuntu 22.04LTS
  with NVIDIA driver 550.163.01.
- Older versions Ubuntu and PX4-Autopilot were not tested.
- Although it is possible to setup a virtual environment following the instructions
  here, this feature was not tested.
- Simulates a barometer based on the implementation provided in PX4 SITL gazebo.
- Simulates a GPS based on the implementation provided in PX4 SITL gazebo
- The period for each sensor update is defined by update_rate.
- The class that implements a monocular camera sensor.
- Available configurations for the lidar are in the folder exts/omni.isaac.sensor/data/lidar_configs
- Check the official documentation for more information
- Computes the forces that should actuate on a rigidbody affected by linear drag
- File that implements a quadratic thrust curve for rotors
- 'License: BSD-3-Clause. Copyright (c) 2023, Marcelo Jacinto. All rights reserved.'
- This class defines the templates for the communication and control backend.
- Every vehicle can have at least one backend at the same time.
- Requires setup of PX4 Mavlink Backend for full functionality
- An auxiliary data class used to store all the configurations for the mavlink communications.
- Describes the state of a vehicle (or rigidbody)
- Defines a base interface for creating a multirotor
- The PeopleManager class is implemented following a singleton pattern.
- Every time a new person object is created, the ‘add_person’ method is invoked.
- Called only when the sim with people is requested.
- PegasusInterface is a singleton class (there is only one object instance at any
  given time) that will be used to manage the Pegasus framework.
