auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.eyesopen.com/webservices/fastrocs/api.html:
  - API uses Bearer token authorization via the Authorization header. Non-staff users
    are denied permission to create datasets. The Authorization header is required
    for this endpoint.
  - An Authorization header is required for API requests. The exact auth scheme or
    credential format is not specified in the documentation provided.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication sent via the Authorization header.
    Include the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with all requests. A 401 Unauthorized
    response indicates missing or invalid credentials, and a 403 Forbidden response
    indicates insufficient permissions for the requested resource.'
  - The API requires an Authorization header for all requests. Include the Authorization
    header with appropriate credentials; requests without valid authorization will
    return a 401 Unauthorized status.
  - The API requires an Authorization header for authentication. The exact auth scheme
    and credential format are not specified in this documentation excerpt, but the
    Authorization header must be included in requests to access protected endpoints
    like the query file download endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.eyesopen.com/webservices/fastrocs/api.html:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes count
    (total results), next (URL for next page), previous (URL for previous page), and
    results array. Stop paginating when next is null.
  - The page query parameter is an integer for specifying the page number in list
    endpoints. No additional pagination details such as page size, total count, next/previous
    page indicators, or stopping conditions are documented.
  - Use offset (integer, number of results to start after) and limit (integer, number
    of results per page) as query parameters to paginate through results. Continue
    requesting with incremented offset values until fewer results than limit are returned,
    indicating the final page.
