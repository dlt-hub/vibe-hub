  paginator: Pagination is required to fetch all users across paginated API responses,
    and the supported method involves using a cursor; you will need to pass in the
    `pagination.after` cursor string into a subsequent `list_projects()` request to
    continue fetching new projects, with a page size parameter of `limit` being required,
    which can be set to a default of "25" and a maximum of "100".
