auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sparkhire.com:
  - Authentication uses HTTP basic auth where the API key is the username and the
    password is ignored. The API key must be sent in the Authorization header as "Basic"
    followed by the base64-encoded string of "api_key:". Each API key is tied to a
    specific user and grants access only to resources that user can access via the
    website.
  - The API uses API key authentication. The user's API key is obtained from the GET
    /users/:uuid/integration_key endpoint and returned in the "key" field of the response.
    This key should be sent with requests, typically in an Authorization header or
    as an api_key query parameter, though the exact transmission method is not specified
    in this documentation excerpt.
  - You must be using an API key from an account admin to delete company users or
    create user API keys. The API key should be sent as authentication credentials
    (exact header/parameter name not specified in this excerpt), and the authenticated
    user must have admin privileges on the account.

  - 'API key authentication is used. The API key is provided in the response as a
    "key" field (example: "efea030e-377b-4ee8-ad72-31a1cfc56d77") and should be sent
    as a credential to authenticate requests, though the exact header or parameter
    name for sending it is not specified in this documentation excerpt.'
  - Authentication uses HTTP basic auth where the API key is the username and the
