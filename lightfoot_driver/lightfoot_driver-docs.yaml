auth_info:
- information_source; https://driverdocs.lightfoot.co.uk/:
  - Basic Auth is required with username and password credentials sent in the request
    header. The username and password are provided as template variables {{username}}
    and {{password}}.
  - Basic Auth is required. Send HTTP requests with a username and password using
    standard HTTP Basic Authentication (base64-encoded credentials in the Authorization
    header as "Basic [base64(username:password)]"). The username is provided as {{username}}
    and password as {{password}}.
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Send credentials using the Authorization
    header with format "Basic base64(username:password)". The username and password
    are provided as template variables {{username}} and {{password}}.
  - The API uses Basic Authentication for all endpoints with 2-factor authentication
    required. Bearer tokens from OAuth2 are also utilized. All users must authenticate
    via login credentials (username and password) before accessing API functionality.
  - The API uses a two-step authentication process. First, POST to /v1/login with
    Basic Auth using a Lightfoot username and password to receive a session token.
    For all subsequent requests, use Basic Auth with username "bearer" and the session
    token as the password in the Authorization header. Session tokens expire after
    1 hour of inactivity (24 hours for special users), and expired sessions return
    a 403 status with "Incorrect user credentials" error.
