auth_info:
- information_source; https://academy.shade.inc/developers/using-the-api/using-the-api:
  - 'API keys are required for all non-public endpoints. Generate an API key in the
    app settings under "My account" > "API keys". The API key must be sent in the
    Authorization header as `Authorization: sk_...` where the value is the generated
    key string. The API key inherits all permissions of the account it was created
    on.'
  - Shade uses the Authorization header for authentication. Send a secret key directly
    in the Authorization header with the format "sk_<your key>" (no "Bearer" prefix
    needed). Include this header in all requests to the API.
- information_source; https://academy.shade.inc/developers/synchronizing-file-state:
  - API key authentication is required. Obtain an API key, then use it to redeem a
    ShadeFS JWT by making a GET request to `GET https://api.shade.inc/workspaces/drives/{drive_id}/shade-fs-token`.
    The JWT returned is valid for 5 minutes and should be used for subsequent authenticated
    requests.
- information_source; https://academy.shade.inc/developers/writing-your-own-uploader:
  - All calls require a ShadeFS token obtained via an API key. First, get the token
    by sending your API key in the Authorization header to the ShadeFS token endpoint,
    then use that token (a JWT) in subsequent requests. The token has an expiration
    time in the exp field that must be checked before each use to avoid using expired
    credentials.
- information_source; https://academy.shade.inc/developers/using-the-api/metadata-guide:
  - 'API key authentication is required and must be sent in the Authorization header
    for all requests to the Shade API. The header format is Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY,
    where YOUR_API_KEY is your actual API key value.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://academy.shade.inc/developers/search:
  - Pagination uses either offset or page (mutually exclusive) as query parameters.
    offset defaults to 0 if neither parameter is provided. limit controls results
    per page. Response structure for pagination fields is not documented.
  - Pagination uses either offset or page parameter (query parameters, optional, mutually
    exclusive). offset defaults to 0 if neither provided. page defaults to 0 if neither
    provided. limit parameter controls results per page, defaults to 100. Stop paginating
    when no more results are returned.
  - The request body includes `offset`, `page`, and `limit` parameters. `offset` is
    an integer for the starting position, `page` is an integer for the page number,
    and `limit` is an integer (default 100) for the number of results per page. The
    response is a downloadable file without explicit pagination fields; pagination
    is controlled entirely through request parameters.
  - Use either offset (defaults to 0) or page (defaults to 0) to navigate results,
    with limit controlling results per page (defaults to 100). The response structure
    for pagination is not explicitly detailed in this excerpt.
