pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.tapclicks.com/:
  - 'Pagination for TapAnalytics endpoints uses the query parameter `page` with two
    sub-parameters: the first specifies the page index starting from 0, and the second
    specifies the number of records per page. This applies to all TapAnalytics endpoints;
    TapOrder endpoints use a different pagination scheme documented in the Orders
    section.'
  - 'The API supports pagination via query parameters: limit (integer, default 1000)
    controls the number of results per request, and page (integer) specifies which
    page to retrieve. The response contains an orders array with order objects.'
  - The API supports query parameter-based pagination with page (string) and count
    (integer) parameters. The response structure includes a data field but no explicit
    pagination metadata fields like next, has_more, or total_count are shown in the
    provided documentation excerpt.
