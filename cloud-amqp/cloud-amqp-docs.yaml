notes:
- The law states that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary
  for the operation of this site.
- CloudAMQP automates the entire setup, operation, and scaling of LavinMQ and RabbitMQ
  clusters.
- This site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party
  services that appear on our pages.
- CloudAMQP offers 24/7 customer support
- Users must provide consent for cookie usage.
- All dedicated servers (paid plans) require billing information.
- Adding billing information is optional for the free plan.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in CloudAMQP
- This site uses different types of cookies.
- CloudAMQP acts as both a Data Controller and a Data Processor.
- Customers can choose between four data centers for hosting their data.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Cookies are small text files that can be used by websites to make a user's experience
  more efficient.
- The API requires authentication through OAuth2 with a refresh token.
- Dedicated plans allow custom RabbitMQ plugins.
- The Web-Stomp plugin can be enabled on all dedicated plans (launched after June
  2014).
- The service is non-returnable.
- We don’t accept checks.
- Requires setup of connected app in CloudAMQP
- General functionality of the website requires necessary cookies.
- Ensure to use an environment variable instead of having connection details in your
  code.
- Use the cluster hostname when connecting your clients. Do not use the server's IP
  address when connecting, as that might change.
- TLS will only secure messages during the transport. What we recommend for highly
  sensitive information (HIPAA, PCI etc) is that you encrypt your message bodies on
  your side and that you have a shared key between your publishers and your consumers.
- You can at any time change or withdraw your consent from the Cookie Declaration
  on our website.
- User accounts that are member of more than one team can still log in using password
  based authentication, however if they try and access a team where SAML is enforced
  then a SAML authentication will be needed before access is granted to that team.
- You can only connect a SAML application on your IdP to a single team in CloudAMQP.
  If your organization uses multiple CloudAMQP teams, you will need to configure one
  SAML application per team.
- You can only use 'Sign in with SAML' on the CloudAMQP login page when the user exists
  in CloudAMQP.
- Some cookies are placed by third party services that appear on our pages.
- This feature is available on dedicated instances
- Changing these configurations does not require a restart of RabbitMQ, and the changes
  will survive a RabbitMQ restart.
- RabbitMQ plugins can cover gaps between standard features and your organization's
  needs.
- Plugins can be enabled and disabled from the Plugins view in the CloudAMQP console.
- Alarms can be sent to email addresses, create push notifications to webhooks, sent
  to Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, VictorOps, Signl4 and OpsGenie.
- Use of CloudAMQP requires setting up OAuth2 for authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- VPC is $99 per month
- VPC Connect allows you to securely connect your applications to CloudAMQP instances
  through private network connections.
- VPC Connect functionality is included with VPC-enabled instances at $99/month.
- Messages that are not valid JSON or larger than 256 KB will be rejected without
  re-queueing, so make sure to configure a dead letter queue where those messages
  can end up if you have very large messages.
- Webhooks are used to push data as soon as it’s received.
- Messages can be acknowledged or retried based on HTTP response status code.
- Integrations are not covered by the SLA.
- CloudAMQP keeps all software on your servers up to date with security patches and
  updates that can be installed without affecting the availability of your service.
- Customers notify when the instance is scheduled for reboot; this notification includes
  a time frame of the reboot, with an option to reschedule within the maintenance
  window.
- The migration feature works in both ways — from RabbitMQ to LavinMQ and from LavinMQ
  to RabbitMQ. Also, the migration feature is currently only available on dedicated
  plans.
- This site uses cookies to personalize content and ads.
- Billing cycles at GCP marketplace are handled through GCP, which makes it very convenient
  for customers to purchase all the components for cloud computing in one place.
- LavinMQ includes delayed messaging functionality as a built-in feature.
- To persist messages to disk, publish to a durable exchange, the receiving queue
  must be durable, and set the 'persistent' flag on the message.
- Shovel is a plugin for RabbitMQ that enables you to define replication relationships
  between brokers.
- Durable streams are required in LavinMQ.
- The MQTT plugin needs to be enabled on dedicated plans.
- QoS 1 is supported (if you are setting QoS 2, it will downgrade to QoS 1).
- Web-STOMP plugin can only be enabled on dedicated plans.
- You can only connect over HTTPS; HTTP is not allowed.
- Our servers have nginx in front of them, which performs TLS/SSL-termination. You
  can only connect over HTTPS; HTTP is not allowed.
- The HTTP API uses basic authentication.
- 'The client has two APIs: low level and high level.'
- Client libraries available for various languages.
- Use a broker pool limit of 1 to decrease connection usage
- Disable heartbeats for better connection handling
- Set broker connection timeout to 30 seconds
- We do not recommend node-amqp as client library. It is for the moment an unmaintained
  project that lacks some basic features and has serious bugs.
- This API requires proper OAuth2 setup.
- Fetch the CLOUDAMQP_URL environment variable from the console page for your instance.
- The website uses cookies to enhance user experience.
- The CLOUDAMQP_URL can be found in the control panel for your instance.
- An important part for users on shared plans is to set channel_max to something else
  than 0.
- The client does not yet support other QoS levels than 0, ie. no publish acknowledge
  or redelivery.
- You can sign up in the control panel and create a new instance from there.
- MQTT client id to use for the device will generate a client id automatically if
  left empty.
