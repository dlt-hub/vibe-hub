notes:
- Rivo's Developer Toolkit is available on the Plus plan.
- CSS changes require time, patience, and some technical prowess.
- If changes don't appear immediately, go to Settings > Troubleshooting and click
  Sync Store
- Make sure you've clicked Save after pasting your CSS
- Clear your browser cache and refresh the customer account page
- Try adding !important to your CSS rules if they're being overridden
- The Dedicated Page is our legacy page builder. While still fully supported, we recommend
  our newer Landing Page which uses Shopify theme extensions for better performance
  and customization.
- Common issues and solutions when working with custom email CSS.
- 'Add !important: Email clients have strong default styles.'
- 'Check specificity: Use more specific selectors like .rivo-preset-loyalty-points-earned
  .email_title.'
- 'Verify class names: Make sure you''re using the correct CSS class names.'
- 'Test in different email clients: Some clients may strip certain styles.'
- This integration only syncs data with existing Sendlane contacts. It does not create
  new contacts in Sendlane. Make sure your customers are already subscribed to your
  Sendlane list before enabling the integration.
- Rivo Memberships requires Shopify Payments to be enabled on your store.
- You can only view your Omnisend API keys once. Be sure to copy and securely store
  each key for future use.
- The 'Loyalty Profile Updated' event will be deprecated soon. We recommend migrating
  to the specific events under Custom Event Triggers for more granular control over
  your automation flows.
- The REST API must be run server-side. It can be integrated into any external system
  or application that requires access to Rivoâ€™s loyalty program data.
- Loyalty data is automatically synced to Attentive whenever a customer's points balance,
  VIP tier, or other relevant data changes in Rivo.
- For new customers, sync can take up to 3 minutes. Changes to existing customers
  should update more quickly.
- The integration automatically syncs all customers who have enabled accounts in your
  store and have opted-in to marketing communications.
- Custom domain is available on the Scale and Plus plans.
- We highly recommend using a subdomain for your Loyalty emails.
- Weglot offers a 10-day free trial that doesn't require payment information upfront.
