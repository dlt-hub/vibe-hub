  - 'Yelp API uses Bearer token authentication. The API key must be passed in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {YELP_API_KEY}". The API key is stored in the
    YELP_API_KEY environment variable and included in fetch requests with the header
    format: Authorization: Bearer {token_value}.'

  - "Ahrefs API uses API Key authentication sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization\
    \ header. To authenticate, generate an MCP key from Ahrefs Workspace \u2192 Account\
    \ Settings \u2192 API Keys, then send it in the Authorization header with the\
    \ format \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"."
  - Connector fails to authenticate requires verifying the MCP server URL at https://api.ahrefs.com/mcp/mcp
    and ensuring your OAuth or API key is active. If using API keys, always add the
    Bearer prefix to the Authorization header. The documentation indicates authentication
    can use either OAuth or API key methods, with API keys sent as Bearer tokens in
    the Authorization header.
  - OAuth authentication is required. Connect via the MCP Server URL at https://api.ahrefs.com/mcp/mcp,
    select your workspace to authorize access, and the connector will handle token
    management after initial authentication.
  - The documentation describes connecting to an Ahrefs MCP server via Claude Developer
    Configuration using an MCP token. The authentication method involves passing an
    Authorization header with a token value specified as the environment variable
    AUTH_HEADER. The token is sent in the Authorization header when making requests
    to the Ahrefs MCP server endpoint at https://api.ahrefs.com/mcp/mcp.
