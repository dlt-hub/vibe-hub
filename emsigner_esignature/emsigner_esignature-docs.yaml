auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.emsigner.com/signer-gateway/getting-started/setting-it-up.html:
  - An authentication token is required to access the Signer Gateway. Generate the
    token by logging into emSigner, navigating to Settings, selecting Manage Auth
    Tokens in the User Section, and clicking Create Auth Token. This token uniquely
    identifies your application and must be included when making requests to the Signer
    Gateway service.
- information_source; https://developers.emsigner.com/signer-gateway/api-reference/retrieving-signed-documents.html:
  - AuthToken is a required query parameter that must be URL-encoded and passed in
    the request URL. The token value should be obtained from the authentication flow
    (e.g., "cbFdZK9esvBzZQ1QynL7IjKb7t92K%2BB4SoEzVA%3D"). This appears to be a session
    or API token-based authentication mechanism where the AuthToken parameter serves
    as the credential for accessing the SignedDataRequest API endpoint.
  - Transaction status is retrieved using a GET request with an authentication token
    passed as a query parameter named Authtoken. The token value appears to be URL-encoded
    and is required to authenticate the request to the transaction status endpoint.
- information_source; https://developers.emsigner.com/esignature-api/getting-started/subscription-api.html:
  - A valid subscription provides access to an Administrator account where you can
    create and manage API access keys and obtain user authentication tokens required
    to connect your application to the REST APIs.
  - To use the REST APIs, you must have a valid envelope subscription and an Administrator
    account. You need to create and manage API access keys and obtain user authentication
    tokens to connect your application to the REST APIs. The specific details on how
    to obtain and use these tokens and keys are not provided in this section.
