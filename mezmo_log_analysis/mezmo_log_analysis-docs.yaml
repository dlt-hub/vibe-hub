pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.mezmo.com/log-analysis-api:
  - Pagination uses a `pagination_id` query parameter that contains tokens tied to
    specific exports and pages for deterministic repeated requests. The `size` query
    parameter specifies the number of log lines per export. Use the `from` and `to`
    query parameters (UNIX timestamps in seconds or milliseconds) to define the time
    range, where passing "0" resolves to retention boundary and current time respectively.
  - Pagination uses a pagination_id query parameter (string, optional) that should
    be left empty for the initial request and then populated with the ID from the
    previous response to retrieve subsequent pages of results.
  - The API includes a limit query parameter (integer type) for the "List Usage by
    Host" endpoint that controls the maximum amount of apps to retrieve, though no
    default value, minimum/maximum bounds, or pagination continuation mechanism is
    specified in the documentation provided.
  - The API uses a limit query parameter to control pagination for the "List Usage
    by Tag" endpoint. The limit parameter is an integer that specifies the maximum
    amount of tags to retrieve in a single request, though the documentation does
    not specify default values, minimum/maximum constraints, or how to navigate to
    subsequent pages.
