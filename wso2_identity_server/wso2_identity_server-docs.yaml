  - 'WSO2 Identity Server supports three authentication methods for REST APIs: basic
    authentication using user credentials, OAuth 2 common flows with tokens, and client
    certificate-based authentication using Mutual SSL. Authorization is enforced at
    the endpoint level using predefined permissions. If none of these authentication
    elements are sent, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.'
- information_source; https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/next/apis/:
  - 'Basic authentication uses the Authorization header with Base64-encoded username:password
    credentials in the format "Authorization: Basic <Base64(username:password)>".
    OAuth-based authentication requires obtaining an OAuth2 bearer token first by
    creating an application, obtaining the required scope from the API definition,
    authorizing the API and scopes to the application, and then using the token in
    subsequent API requests; supported grant types include Password, Client-credentials,
    and AuthorizationCode.'
  - 'Use Bearer token authentication by including the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>". Alternatively, mutual SSL certificate-based
    authentication is supported, which can be configured with intermediate certificate
    validation in the deployment.toml file using the [intermediate_cert_validation]
    section with enable, cert_cns, and exempt_contexts parameters.'
