  - 'The API supports two bearer token authentication schemes sent via the Authorization
    header. AccessKey tokens are used for server authentication, while personal access
    tokens are used for user authentication. Both are passed using the Authorization
    Bearer scheme (format: Authorization: Bearer {token}).'
- information_source; https://www.challengermode.com/developers/docs/auth-api/server-authentication:
  - Bearer token authentication is used to call authorized endpoints. Include the
    access token obtained from authentication in the Authorization header with the
    format "Bearer <access_token>". The access token is a JWT that expires at the
    time specified in the expiresAt field returned during token acquisition.
  - 'Bot authentication uses short-lived BOT access tokens obtained by exchanging
    a long-lived Refresh Key. The Refresh Key is created in the Application Dashboard,
    and exchanged via POST /v1/auth/access_keys to get a BOT token with a default
    20-minute lifetime.


    To authenticate requests: include the BOT access token in the Authorization header
    (standard bearer token format). The Refresh Key is a long-lived credential stored
    securely and used server-side to obtain new access tokens when needed.'
  - 'Use a long-lived refresh key (generated in the Application Dashboard and stored
    securely) to request a short-lived bot access token via the POST /v1/auth/access_keys
    endpoint. The access token is a JWT that grants access to specific API resources.


    Key details: Refresh key is a base64-encoded string shown only once during creation.
    Exchange it with the /v1/auth/access_keys endpoint to obtain a JWT access token
    (value field) that is short-lived and used for subsequent API requests.'

  - OAuth2 device code flow with periodic token endpoint polling. Send POST requests
    to https://challengermode.com/oauth/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    containing device_code, client_id (your application ID), and grant_type set to
    urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code. The endpoint returns authorization_pending
    until user completes verification on their device, then returns access tokens.
    For token refresh, request the offline_access scope in the authorize URL to receive
    a refresh token valid for 3 months, which can be exchanged for new PAT tokens
    without re-authentication.
