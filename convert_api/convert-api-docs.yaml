notes:
- 'API Key Authentication: Token-based user-level authentication.'
- 'Cookie Authentication: Used primarily for web-based session management.'
- Your experiment won't run without the proper code installed.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Sometimes, the changes that are created on the Visual Editor will not change the
  elements when previewed.
- Whitelisting specific domains in your CSP policy for Convert Experiments is essential.
- Domains to whitelist include *.metrics.convertexperiments.com, logs.convertexperiments.com,
  and *.convertexperiments.com.
- Disabling experiments on specific pages is done using a JavaScript snippet.
- All experiences must have a selected environment.
- The experience URL must have the latest tracking script installed.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- If trying to exclude visitors that were included on a test configured with less
  than 100% traffic, a cookie is still written if they met the Site Area and Audience
  conditions but due to the traffic restriction, were not actually included in that
  experiment.
- All new experiences utilize t-tests instead of z-tests as of October 13th, 2023.
- Two-tailed tests are recommended by default for greater reliability.
- Clearbit data needs to be inserted before Convert's tracking code.
- Some functionalities depend on the proper setup of Clearbit Reveal tracking.
- This integration is still in beta status. Use with caution the steps described below.
- Data Anonymization feature may affect values returned in variation names.
- Some features may be limited depending on your plan.
- Using cart permalinks means Convert can only track goals related to the checkout
  page.
- Goals such as collection_viewed, product_viewed, and search_submitted cannot be
  tracked.
- Uses browser cookies and local storage for tracking visitor data.
- The custom web pixel only runs on checkout_completed events
- Minimal performance impact as it focuses only on goal triggering
- No revenue tracking or complex calculations
- When you contact us via in-app support, our team has direct access to your account
  context.
- AI assistants and search tools require a plain-text endpoint called /llms.txt to
  understand and cite your site.
- The same visitor ID must be used for routes like /page/* and /llms.txt.
- For production use cases, you'll want to integrate these API calls directly into
  your own application.
- Your tracking requests will need to include the user-agent header with a value.
- JavaScript can be used with Convert in a diversity of cases.
- Start with reporting access level and escalate only when needed
- Regularly rotate your API credentials
- Preventing cross-experiment contamination is essential for maintaining the validity
  of your testing program.
- Ensure tracking code for Convert and comScore are installed on your page.
- Custom labels 'exp_id' and 'var_id' are required for accurate reporting.
- Combining the flexibility of Shopify's Liquid templating language with the robust
  testing capabilities of Convert Experiments allows store owners to create highly
  personalized and dynamic user experiences.
- 'Maintain Experiment Consistency: Ensure alignment in objectives, variations, and
  expected outcomes between Full Stack and Web Testing projects.'
- 'Clear Variation Communication: Use consistent identifiers for experiments and variations
  across both projects.'
- 'Comprehensive Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality and data
  accuracy before going live.'
- Only use the legacy tracking code for Shopify.
- This article provides an example configuration for tracking YouTube video interactions.
- This article will help you preserve original URL query parameters when running split
  tests with pre-existing variation parameters.
- Convert supports Do Not Track because we think it’s really important that you have
  a simple way to control how end-user information gets used.
- GPC signals are sent by users' browsers or devices to communicate their privacy
  preferences.
- Do not include your Original URL on the Original URL Pattern text box.
- Check the Support Regular Expressions option.
- Do not enable the Transfer Original URL variables to the variation URL.
- Use cookie hand-off for quickest implementation with tracking script.
- Use Convert SDK for full backend control, ideal for Split-URL or headless setups.
- Maximum file size you can upload to your library is 2MB per image file.
- Visual Editor allows users to upload up to 50 images per hour per account-project.
- This should only be used when you need to fire Convert when the view is mounted,
  which is not the case on most cases.
- You do not need additional JavaScript conditions in your experiment audiences.
- This might work in most cases, but you might run on to race conditions getting a
  flash then.
- The only guaranteed way to not flashing in most cases is to load the tracking code
  in sync mode.
- If you use the latest version of the Convert script, none of what is described in
  this article is relevant, as it has built in and optimized features for SPAs.
- Convert experiments do not run when the URL has a hash.
- Please test it with your SPA framework, as it might not detect hash changes in all
  frameworks.
- Delaying cookie writing and experiment execution ensures compliance with GDPR and
  CCPA.
- Page blur can be used to enhance consent visibility.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Convert
- Use with caution. If you use the opt-out method, a cookie is set in your browser.
- To prevent Google Shopping traffic from being bucketed into an experiment, identify
  the traffic using UTM tags or referrer URL.
- Add a parameter like utm_source=google_shopping to your links.
- Parameters can be in any order and only replaced parameters will be transferred
  to the new URL.
- Replace <experiment_id> with the actual experiment ID from Convert Experiences.
- Shopify removes webhook configurations that have not been used within a certain
  time period.
- Convert doesn't provide built-in widgets like exit pop-ups, but you can easily implement
  one using Ouibounce.js.
- Always include error handling and logging for debugging
- Test the implementation in multiple browsers
- Consider mobile interactions for a seamless experience
- Monitor performance impact of added JavaScript
- Use specific selectors to avoid conflicts
- Must SPA frameworks do not use as Convert the DOM API to deploy changes because
  of performance reasons.
- The Convert script removes code added when the experiment conditions do not match
  the subsequent view where the changes were deployed when the polling is called.
- By default, convert cookies that are set under your domain will be set with the
  'secure' flag false.
- Cookies that are stored and accessed under a specific domain cannot be accessed
  from a page hosted on another domain.
- The only way to transfer cookie data via query parameters is by calling a page on
  the second domain on an iframe.
- Uses GTM for tracking purchases without modifying Shopify's theme code.
- Ensure Convert Visual Editor & Tracking Work Seamlessly with Correct Site & CSP
  Configurations
- 'GA4 Integration: Required for custom dataLayer name support.'
- This is a legacy request structure.
- Use the new tracking structure for advanced integrations.
- Requires setup of connected app in Convert Experiences
- To prevent redirection loops, ensure that your experiment’s location settings exclude
  URLs containing the new query parameter (`new_param=value`).
- Convert allows the creation of multiple projects, enabling separate testing for
  each client.
- To track conversions, utilize Shopify webhooks to send data directly to Convert.
- Force Variation only works on Active experiences.
- You must still match the Site Area and Audience conditions for this to work properly.
- If you add the eforce parameter twice to your URL, both parameters will be ignored.
- Forcing a variation is handy when you have an experiment set to less than 100% traffic.
- Maximum 5 minutes delay on the propagation of any change after activating an experiment.
- By default the extension has access to all sites, to restrict access only on the
  whitelisted domains.
- The main Convert tracking code needs to be installed in the <head> section of the
  page, before any other loaded resource.
- For websites that use Cloudflare with rocket loader enabled, experiments setup through
  Convert Experiences will work but will render with delay causing a poor experience
  for your visitors.
- Cloudflare offers a way to disable rocket loader for certain scripts and it's explained
  in their support forums.
- Uses JavaScript conditions to trigger experiments in Angular applications.
- Uses JavaScript conditions in single-page applications for triggering experiments.
- Changes triggered by the experiment will not be reset as they would be with a normal
  web page.
- Convert uses only first-party cookies, even for cross-domain setups.
- All the websites within one Convert Project share the cookies making it possible
  to achieve cross-domain testing, UNLESS you enable the Project Setting 'Do not allow
  cross-domain linking'.
- Cross domain cookie will be by default turned off for all projects in Convert Experiences
  due to GDPR.
- Please verify that you installed the code in the header of the page, preferably
  after the </title> tag and before the </head> tag of your website.
- Make sure Convert experiments tracking code is placed on page BEFORE your analytics
  software tracking code; this will probably solve the issue in most of the situations.
- To make sure that no traffic is recorded on original URL whenever the variation
  is presented, wrap your analytics software tracking code with the provided condition.
- Make sure the URL(s) in Active Websites in your Project Configuration matches the
  website you installed the Convert tracking code on.
- Experiment variations in Draft status can be edited.
- You cannot add new variations to experiments that have any status other than Draft.
- In click on a link goals there is a common problem, as soon as someone clicks on
  a link, the page gets redirected even before the conversion request can be completed,
  this happens in some browsers and causes the link/form/click tracking to be accurate
  up to 85%.
- Convert’s click-based goal tracking uses a substring match approach.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Convert Experiences
- Easily Edit Your Variations from the Experience Summary Dashboard
- The feature is disabled by default but can be enabled in the Project Configuration
  Panel.
- Available only for enterprise and pro plans.
- Some API endpoints may have rate limits
- Ensure OAuth tokens are refreshed regularly
- Understanding the detailed mechanics of Split URL experiments on Convert.com enables
  you to design and execute tests that yield reliable and actionable insights.
- The QA overlay widget is not available for users using the legacy tracking script.
- Ensure the page URL or cookies meet one of the prerequisites for the widget to load.
- Users can create multiple environments based on their subscription plan.
- Only one environment can be designated as 'Production'.
- Use the flag to disable tracking when retrieving variations.
- Only fully-qualified page URLs are supported for script verification.
- Wildcard domains (e.g., *.example.com) are allowed as inputs but cannot be verified.
  These will show an orange warning with no script validation.
- Sites that block headless browsers or restrict cloud IP access may not return a
  successful detection, even if the script is installed correctly.
- URLs behind authentication walls or login screens cannot be verified.
- Overwrite & Save replaces the most recent server version with your current draft.
  Coordinate with teammates and review Change History when in doubt.
- Custom Prompt does not expose or allow editing of the underlying system prompt.
- The integration will only send data when actual experiments are running and users
  are assigned to variations.
- The code checks for the availability of Quantum Metric before attempting to send
  any data.
- Integration uses variables and events to pass along the experiment name and variation
  name.
- Integrates with Matomo for enhanced visitor analytics and insights
- This integration is still in beta status. Use with caution the steps described.
- Clicky custom data tracking are Pro-only features, so you might have to upgrade
  to Clicky Premium to see this data.
- Seamlessly Connect Convert Experiments with Woopra for Real-Time Visitor Analytics
- This integration classifies a transaction as a subscription if there are ANY subscription
  articles in the transaction.
- Only one or two products can be tracked separately by SKU.
- It is highly recommended to utilize the Convert Shopify App integration rather than
  following the steps outlined in this article.
- If you are on Shopify Plus stop here!
- Uses GTM Data Layer to integrate Convert with GA
- This integration allows you to track Convert Experience data in Wufoo form submissions.
- Make sure that both tracking codes (Convert + GA) are added on your website head
  section.
- Any custom Google Analytics code could break the integration.
- There could be a 24-48 hours data processing latency.
- not all ClickTale accounts offer the features we present below. To be able to integrate
  you need a ClickTale account that has Event Tracking and Fields enabled.
- Requires setup of API keys in Crazy Egg Account under options menu.
- When Data Anonymization is turned on, names of variations and experiments will be
  replaced by their IDs.
- Webhooks are used to push a call convert to Convert Experiences.
- This article has been superseded by a linked article.
- Do not use to integrate with Clicky.
- Legacy Clicky Integration (for reference only)
