auth_info:
- information_source; https://production.deepvue.tech/docs:
  - API Key authentication is required and must be sent as a custom header named api-key
    with your API key value. OAuth2 Client Credentials flow is also supported as an
    authorization method for certain endpoints like bulk PAN verification.
  - Access tokens are required to use the Platform APIs and are obtained by sending
    client_id and client_secret as form data to the POST /v1/authorize endpoint. Each
    token is valid for 24 hours and must be renewed after expiration by calling the
    authorize endpoint again with the same credentials. The token should be sent in
    subsequent API requests as an Authorization header.
  - 'Authorization requires two credentials sent as headers: Bearer token in the Authorization
    header and API key in the x-api-key header. For bulk operations, OAuth2 Client
    Credentials flow is used.


    Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`

    x-api-key header: `x-api-key: <YOUR API KEY>`

    OAuth2 scheme: Client Credentials grant type'
  - OAuth2 Client Credentials authentication is required. Obtain an access token using
    your client ID and client secret, then include it in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {access_token}" for requests to this endpoint.
  - 'OAuth2 Client Credentials flow is required for authentication. Include an Authorization
    header with Bearer token format: Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>. Additionally,
    include the x-api-key header with your API key: x-api-key: YOUR API KEY. Both
    credentials must be provided in the request headers.'
