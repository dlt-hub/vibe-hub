notes:
- Xitrum does not automatically send any default response.
- If there’s no route for URL `/foo/bar`, Xitrum will try to look for static file
  `public/foo/bar/index.html`.
- Xitrum is an async and clustered Scala web framework and HTTP(S) server fusion on
  top of Netty and Akka.
- 'Xitrum tries to fill the spectrum between Scalatra and Lift: more powerful than
  Scalatra and easier to use than Lift.'
- Xitrum automatically serves static files inside public directory.
- Chunked response has many use cases.
- Session storing, restoring, encrypting, etc. is done automatically by Xitrum.
- Xitrum is an async and clustered Scala web framework.
- Supports long polling, chunked response (streaming), WebSocket, and SockJS.
- Xitrum does not require authentication for API access.
- Cookies are not suited for SockJS model. If you want to authorize a session, provide
  a unique token on a page, send it as a first thing over SockJS connection and validate
  it on the server side.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Xitrum listens on port 8000 and 4430 by default.
- The default maximum number of open file is 1024.
- Cookies are not suited for SockJS model; provide a unique token for session authorization.
- JavaScript cannot access cookies marked as HttpOnly.
- To delete a cookie, set its max age to 0.
- Internet Explorer does not support 'max-age'.
- Xitrum supports internationalization using GNU gettext.
- Use the LRU cache for a small convenient cache.
- Xitrum is designed to run in production environment as multiple instances behind
  a proxy server or load balancer
- Keys and strings must be quoted with double quotes
- Currently, you cannot write comment in JSON file
