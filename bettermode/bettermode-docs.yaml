auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/graphql/schema/:
  - 'The Bettermode GraphQL API uses Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access
    token via App Authentication or Member Authentication, then include it in the
    Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer {Access Token}` with all requests.'
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/guide/graphql/authentication/app/:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with basic authentication. Replace {clientId} and
    {clientSecret} with your App's credentials and send them via HTTP basic auth (base64-encoded
    in Authorization header as "Basic {base64(clientId:clientSecret)}") or in the
    POST request body to obtain an accessToken. Optionally include impersonateMemberId
    to generate a token for a specific member; omitting it generates a bot account
    token. Access tokens are JWTs that expire (default 30 days); decode the exp claim
    to check expiration and reauthenticate when needed.
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/guide/graphql/getting-started/:
  - All requests to Bettermode's GraphQL endpoint require authentication using either
    an App Access Token or a Member Access Token. The specific implementation details
    for how to send these tokens (header names, parameter names, etc.) are referenced
    in separate documentation pages but not provided in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/guide/graphql/making-queries/:
  - All requests to Bettermode's GraphQL endpoint require authentication using either
    an App Access Token or a Member Access Token. These tokens should be sent as credentials
    with each request to the single GraphQL POST endpoint.
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/operations/schema/:
  - 'Bettermode GraphQL API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {Access Token}" when making
    POST requests to the GraphQL endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.bettermode.com/docs/guide/graphql/making-queries/:
  - 'The API uses cursor-based pagination with limit parameter. In queries, pass limit
    (e.g., limit: 1) to control page size. Responses return edges array containing
    node objects, and totalCount field. Use edges to iterate through paginated results;
    continue fetching with updated limit values until all edges are retrieved.'
