notes:
- 'Outside calls to API must specify an authorization header in the form Authorization:
  Bearer <token>'
- Encore supports both public and private API definitions
- Almost every application needs to know who's calling it.
- Each API endpoint can be marked as requiring authentication.
- If the auth handler returns an AuthData object, the request is considered authenticated.
- This package provides the APIs for getting AppMetadata about the current application
  and the CurrentRequest.
- By default, Service singletons are shared across all tests and initialized on the
  first call to that service by any test, which results in faster tests as you are
  not re-initializing the service for each test, however if your service structs contain
  state that is not reset between tests, this can cause issues.
- If you want to mock out more than one API method on a service, consider using MockService.
- This package is not in the latest version of its module.
- When a project reaches major version v1 it is considered stable.
