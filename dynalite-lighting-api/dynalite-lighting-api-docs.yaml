notes:
- API access requires a correctly configured System Manager server on the network.
- v1.1 of the Lighting API is intended for release with System Manager 1.37.9 or later.
- The DA password is encrypted, so store a copy in a secure location for future reference.
  The password will be required later when installing System Manager.
- The API server uses port `3260`, **not** the data access port shown above.
- User authentication requires a username and password for each user.
- This enables users on their own PC to authenticate when prompted and gain access
  to secured Dashboard/API resources.
- Multiroom System Manager has previously been branded as 'Interact Hospitality',
  'Interact Architecture STR', and 'Interact for Hotels & Resorts'.

- API access requires a working Philips Dynalite lighting control system with a System
  Manager server on the network.
- We recommend using a secure HTTPS connection to access APIs.
