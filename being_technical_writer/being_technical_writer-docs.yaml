auth_info:
- information_source; https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation/apirequestsresponses.html:
  - API Keys are sent in request headers or query parameters as a single token. Basic
    Auth uses Base64-encoded username and password credentials. OAuth 2.0 uses token-based
    authorization. The documentation indicates 401 Unauthorized responses require
    authentication and 403 Forbidden responses indicate insufficient permissions,
    but specific header names, parameter names, token acquisition flows, scopes, or
    implementation details are not provided.
  - The documentation describes common API authentication methods including API keys
    (sent via headers, query parameters, or request body), OAuth 2.0 (for delegated
    authorization using access tokens), JWT (JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication),
    Basic Authentication (username/password encoded in headers), Bearer tokens (typically
    with OAuth), Digest Authentication, and HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication
    Code). The specific choice depends on security requirements, client type, and
    whether third-party access is needed. For secure transmission, always use HTTPS/TLS,
    never include passwords or tokens in URLs, mask sensitive data in logs, implement
    proper authentication and authorization, and use secure headers like Strict-Transport-Security
    and Content-Security-Policy.
- information_source; https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation/beginnerrestapiexercises.html:
  - API key authentication is required and must be passed as the `apikey` query parameter

    for all requests to authenticate with the API.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass the apikey parameter as a query string
    parameter in the GET request to /search endpoint. The apikey parameter is mandatory
    and must contain your API key value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation/beginnerrestapiexercises.html:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with page parameter (query string, optional,
    default 1). Response includes page, total_results, and total_pages fields to track
    pagination state. Stop paginating when current page equals total_pages.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (integer, default 1) to specify
    the page number. Response includes page (current page number), total_results (total
    recipes found), and total_pages (total number of pages available). Stop paginating
    when page equals total_pages.'
  - The API supports pagination via a page query parameter (integer, optional, default
    value 1) in GET /search requests. However, the documentation does not specify
    response fields indicating total pages, next page availability, or when to stop
    paginating.
