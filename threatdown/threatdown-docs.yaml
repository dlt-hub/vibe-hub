auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.threatdown.com/hc/en-us/articles/30353265633939-OneView-API-examples-using-PowerShell:
  - The API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication. POST to the /oauth2/token
    endpoint with a Basic Authorization header containing Base64-encoded ClientID:ClientSecret,
    and a request body with grant_type set to 'client_credentials' and a scope parameter.
    The response contains access_token and expires_in fields that should be used for
    subsequent API requests.
  - The API uses a token-based authentication scheme where credentials are passed
    via a OneView.Token object that contains a Headers property. The token is extracted
    from the OneViewToken parameter (a PSTypeName of 'OneView.Token') and its Headers
    are included in the Invoke-RestMethod call as the -Headers argument for authentication.
  - The authentication uses a OneView token object passed as a mandatory parameter.
    The token's Headers property is extracted and sent with the REST API request via
    the -Headers parameter of Invoke-RestMethod. The token object must be of type
    OneView.Token and is typically obtained through a prior authentication step with
    the OneView API.
  - This API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication. Obtain a token
    by calling Get-OneViewToken with a ClientID (UUID format) and ClientSecret (64-character
    hex string), optionally specifying a Scope parameter (defaults to 'read write
    execute') and BaseUrl (defaults to 'https://api.malwarebytes.com/oneview'). The
    returned token is then used for subsequent API requests.
  - Use the OneView.Token object obtained from Get-OneViewToken with ClientID and
    ClientSecret. Pass the token's Headers property in the -Headers parameter of Invoke-RestMethod
    requests. The token contains the necessary authentication credentials for API
    calls to Malwarebytes OneView endpoints.
pagination_info:

  - Pagination is used when gathering all users from OneView. The function iterates
    through a paginated response, but the specific pagination parameters, response
    fields, and navigation mechanism are not detailed in the provided documentation
    excerpt.

  : - Use cursor-based pagination with pageSize (query parameter, optional, controls
      number of results per request) and nextCursor (query parameter, optional, token
      from previous response). Response includes nextCursor field; when null, pagination
      is complete. Construct next request by passing the nextCursor value as the nextCursor
      parameter.
