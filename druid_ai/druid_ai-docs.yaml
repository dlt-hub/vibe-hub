  - Use Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header
    of your request. Obtain the token by generating a permanent token or using the
    authentication endpoint (see Webhooks documentation). For DRUID versions prior
    to 7.7, retrieve the token from Administration > Druid Services under 'Druid.Endpoints'.
- information_source; https://docs.druidai.com/1385954/Content/Webhooks.htm:
  - Bearer token authentication is used for API requests. Generate a permanent token
    from the UI and include it in the Authorization header, or obtain a temporary
    access token by posting username, password, and tenant name to the ExternalAuthenticate
    endpoint at POST *.druidplatform.com/api/services/app/WebAPIService/ExternalAuthenticate,
    which returns an accessToken in the response body to use as a bearer token.
- information_source; https://docs.druidai.com/1385954/Content/How to/Authenticating Users in the DRUID Webchat.htm:
  - DRUID API uses a short-lived token-based authentication scheme. The server must
    send user metadata (domainUserName, firstName, lastName, email, masterId) in the
    request body to obtain a token that expires in 30 minutes. This token is then
    passed to the web page client via a queryParam named DruidToken in the DRUID Webchat
    snippet initialization.
  - The authentication flow uses a token passed via query parameters to the DRUID
    API. Include the "x-api-key" header with the Client API Key value generated in
    the DRUID Portal. Send an authenticated POST request to /GetAuthorizationContextByToken
    with the token in the request body as a JSON object with the "token" field.

  : - 'Access tokens are obtained via the ExternalAuthenticate API using username
      and password credentials (example: username "oana" and password "Oana123!@#"),
      which returns an access token valid for 30 minutes (1800 seconds). The access
      token must be provided in the authorization section of the PerformOperations
      request; pass it as an Authorization header with the Bearer scheme or in the
      request''s authorization field as specified by the API client interface.'
