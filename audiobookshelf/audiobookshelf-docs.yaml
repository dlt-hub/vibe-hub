pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.audiobookshelf.org/:
  - Pagination uses an optional `limit` query parameter (default 25) to control how
    many library items are returned per request. The response contains a `libraryItems`
    array; continue requesting with the same `limit` to retrieve additional pages,
    stopping when fewer items than `limit` are returned.
  - Pagination uses itemsPerPage query parameter to set page size. Response includes
    total (total items), numPages (total pages), page (current page, zero-indexed),
    and itemsPerPage (items per page). Increment page parameter to retrieve subsequent
    pages until page equals numPages minus one.
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, query parameter, controls results per page, 0
    means no limit) and page (integer, query parameter, 0-indexed page number, has
    no effect when limit is 0). Response includes total (total results), limit, page,
    and sortDesc fields.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (integer, controls results per
    page) and page (integer, 0-indexed page number). Response includes episodes array,
    total (total episode count), limit, and page. If limit is 0, no limit applies
    and page has no effect.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit and page. The limit parameter
    sets results per page (0 for no limit), and page specifies the 0-indexed page
    number. When limit is 0, the page parameter has no effect and all results are
    returned. The response includes total (total count), limit, and page fields.
