- information_source; https://bitpaper-api.herokuapp.com/:
  - 'API requests to Bitpaper require a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    You have two tokens available: a Production API token for live apps that charges
    your account, and a Test API token for testing without charges. Both tokens are
    found at http://bitpaper.io/account#api and should be included as "Authorization:
    Bearer <my-secret-api-token>" in request headers.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the API token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <my-secret-api-token>". For iframe embedding, pass the access
    token as a query parameter named "access-token" in the src URL, along with an
    optional "user_name" query parameter.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the API token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <my-secret-api-token>". The token must be included with every
    request to the API endpoint.
  - 'Bitpaper uses bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the Authorization
    header of all requests as `Authorization: Bearer <my-secret-api-token>`. Retrieve
    your token from your Bitpaper account settings at bitpaper.io/account#api. If
    compromised, regenerate tokens from the API settings page.'
  - 'Use Bearer token authentication by including the Authorization header with the
    format "Authorization: Bearer <my-secret-api-token>" when making API requests
