notes:
- API versioning follows alpha, beta, stable progression
- Alpha versions may be buggy and disabled by default
- Beta versions are well tested but may have incompatible changes
- Stable versions use vX format where X is an integer
- Multiple API versions supported at different API paths
- Uses OpenAPI specification via /openapi/v2 endpoint
- API versioning follows semantic versioning with alpha, beta, and stable levels
- Multiple API versions supported at different paths like /api/v1 or /apis/extensions/v1beta1
- OpenAPI spec available at /openapi/v2 endpoint
- Protocol buffer serialization format available for intra-cluster communication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token – requires setup of connected app in Salesforce
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Free API for testing and prototyping
- No authentication required
- Supports pagination with limit and skip parameters
- Swagger is an open source API documentation framework that helps developers design,
  document, and consume RESTful web services
- Swagger reads an API and extracts information in the form of interactive UI called
  Swagger UI
- Swagger UI offers HTML view of API with JSON support for direct API testing
- Swagger automatically captures details from API and presents them in readable format
- Changes in REST API automatically update Swagger UI by restarting the app
- Most widely adopted API documentation framework standardized for REST API services
- The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface
  to RESTful APIs
- Swagger is an open-source framework for documenting and testing RESTful APIs
- Generates interactive documentation that allows developers to visualize an API's
  resources and test the API
- Swagger UI offers HTML view of API with JSON support so that we can directly test
  our API
- Automatically captures details from API and presents it in readable and compact
  screen
- If there is any change in the REST API it automatically reads the updated code and
  updates the Swagger UI just by restarting the app
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of connected app in Salesforce
- API responses can be in JSON or XML format
- Authentication process verifies client identity before API access
- REST is stateless and uses predefined operations for resource manipulation
- SOAP leverages XML Information Set for message format
- The API is served over TLS (hence the https:// and wss:// prefixes)
- For security reasons, it is strongly recommended that you install your own SSL certificate
  into PVX instead of using the pre-installed one
- The API can stream chunks instead of returning a single response
- Arguments and their values are delimited by &. The values are interpreted as JSON
- To use the streaming mode, use the stream/ prefix before the function's name
- The TRQ API is served over TLS (hence the https:// and wss:// prefixes)
- For security reasons, it is strongly recommended that you install your own SSL certificate
  into TRQ instead of using the pre-installed one
- API responses are formatted as JSON
- The API is also able to stream chunks instead of returning a single response
- All API functions can be called with either the GET or POST HTTP methods
- Function arguments are usually passed through the query string
- Legacy API gateways fall short in regard to scalability, traffic management, security,
  and observability
- Modern API gateways need to evolve in areas such as Kubernetes support, microservices,
  multi-cloud deployments, and cloud-native innovation
- Built on Envoy Proxy
- Supports zero-trust security and advanced threat prevention
- Built-in Internet scalability and high availability, with lower resource use
- Integrates seamlessly into DevOps/GitOps workflows
- Extensible across operating environments, customizable with any language
- Most popular architecture for building microservices
- 'Top choices for building microservices: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes'
- 'Lots of concepts involved: REST API, Service Discovery, API Gateway, Naming Server,
  Circuit Breakers, Load Balancing, Security'
- 'Diverse deployment options: Containers, Orchestration, Cloud-native environments'
- 'Needs knowledge of tools and platforms: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes,
  Cloud, and more'
- First steps are challenging
- Document discusses using GPUs for real-time SAR simulation
- Real-time simulation useful for mission planning, education and information extraction
- Less realistic models acceptable for real-time approach
- SARViz simulator uses vertex and pixel shaders for SAR geometry and radiometry
- Uses GPU-based real-time SAR simulation for mission planning and education
- Less accurate but fast simulators preferred for real-world applications
- Requires 3D models but can work with limited detail for real-time performance
- This appears to be a research document about consumer behavior towards Pepsi and
  Coca Cola brands
- Document contains information about PepsiCo's business operations in India including
  manufacturing facilities and farmer partnerships
- PepsiCo India operates 67 beverage plants and 6 food plants
- Company works with over 24,000 farmers across nine states in India
- PepsiCo achieved 'Positive Water Balance' status and has been Water Positive since
  then
- Document appears to be an academic operations management case study on Nestle

- Resources can be accessed at their corresponding URLs
- Server-side APIs expose endpoints to receive requests from clients and return data
  in different formats
- REST APIs store resources using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) accessible at
  URLs
- SOAP is built on top of HTTP and many REST services use HTTP as their communication
  protocol
- Three of five HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) are idempotent - end result is independent
  of number of duplicate requests
- GET is used to retrieve resources without changing data
- PUT creates or overwrites entire resource at target URL
- POST creates resources but is not idempotent - duplicate requests create multiple
  resources
- PATCH updates parts of existing resource without overwriting entire resource
- DELETE removes resource and is idempotent
- Default Connection idle time out in HTTP Connector is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds)
- Response Time out in HTTP Requester is the maximum time that the request element
  will block the execution of the flow waiting for the HTTP response
- Connection idle time out and Response time out can be increased in HttpConnector->Connector
  Configuration
- POST requests are never cached and do not remain in browser history
- PUT requests are idempotent - calling the same PUT request multiple times will always
  produce the same result
- GET requests can be cached and remain in browser history
- Twinning (duplicate POST requests) can be eliminated using Idempotent filter in
  MULE
- GET requests can be cached, remain in browser history, can be bookmarked, should
  not be used with sensitive data, have length restrictions
- POST requests are never cached, do not remain in browser history, cannot be bookmarked,
  have no restrictions on data length
- Twinning can occur when the same POST request is sent multiple times to a resource
  - can be eliminated using Idempotent filter in MULE
