notes:
- It is strongly recommended that the logging module is configured, as no errors or
  warnings will be output if it is not set up.
- This is recommended, especially at verbose levels such as INFO, and DEBUG as there
  are a lot of events logged and it would clog the stdout of your program.
- Uses API Key for authentication.
- Request timeout is set to 30 seconds.
- API Key required for authentication.
