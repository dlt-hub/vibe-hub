auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.3/Administration/Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/CORS/
  : - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are sent via the Authorization
      header using Base64-encoded username:password format (Basic auth scheme). The
      example shows username "superuser" and password "superuser" encoded as "c3VwZXJ1c2VyOnN1cGVydXNlcg==".
      Session management uses JSESSIONID cookies set by the server.
    - 'Basic authentication is required. Send credentials using the `-u username:password`
      flag in curl, which encodes them as Base64 in the `Authorization: Basic` header.
      For example, use `Authorization: Basic c3VwZXJ1c2VyOnN1cGVydXNlcg==` where the
      value is the Base64-encoded string of `username:password`. The server also sets
      a session cookie `JSESSIONID` in the response for subsequent requests.'
    - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
      header as a Base64-encoded string in the format "username:password". Example:
      the credentials superuser:superuser encode to Basic c3VwZXJ1c2VyOnN1cGVydXNlcg==,
      which is passed as Authorization: Basic [base64-encoded-credentials]. Authentication
      is required to access the REST endpoints, and different HTTP methods may require
      different permission levels.'

  : - Logging in via GET query parameters is disabled by default and returns 401 Unauthorized.
      To enable GET or other HTTP methods for form login, add them to the configuration
      property info.magnolia.cms.security.auth.login.FormLogin#allowedMethods. Additional
      login handlers available include CAS, WeChat Login, LDAP Connector, and SSO
      modules, all using JAAS for authentication.

  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are sent using the `--user` parameter
    in curl (or via the `Authorization` header with base64-encoded username:password
    in the format `Basic base64(username:password)`). The example shows `--user superuser:superuser`.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/rest/3.0.0/api/delivery-endpoint/:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit request parameters. Responses include total,
    offset, and limit metadata fields. The offset parameter specifies the starting
    position (default 0), and limit controls results per page (default 50). Continue
    paginating by incrementing offset until results returned are fewer than limit
    or offset exceeds total.
- information_source; https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/rest/api/delivery-endpoint/:
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata with three fields: total (total number
    of results), offset (current starting position), and limit (number of results
    per page). These values are returned in each response to support client-side pagination
    implementation.'
