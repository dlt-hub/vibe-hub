notes:
- Burp AI enhances efficiency but does not replace human expertise.
- Your data stays within PortSwigger’s secure AI platform and is never stored by the
  AI service provider or used for model training purposes.
- Easy integration with any CI/CD platform, native support for Jira, GitLab, and Trello.
- No limit to number of users per license.
- Licensed by your specific scanning requirements.
- The Web Security Academy is a free online training center for web application security.
- Requires setup of connected app in api

- We've upgraded Burp's browser to Chromium 140.0.7339.81 (Win/Mac) and 140.0.7339.80
  (Linux).
- DevSecOps integration with native support for Jira, GitLab, and Trello.
- This attack highlights how combining round-trip attacks with namespace confusion
  can lead to unauthenticated access to GitLab.
- The vulnerability stems from inconsistencies in how different XML parsers handle
  document validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate signature verification.
- Shadow Repeater aids deep, targeted testing by analysing your payloads.
- It generates variations and looks for differences in the response.
- This post is the culmination of a three-step collaboration with the security community.
- The community nominated a staggering 121 pieces of research - nearly double what
  we saw last time.
- Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases but can be much harder
  depending on the complexity of the application and the ways it handles user-controllable
  data.
- Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker
  to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.
- Integration is a core part of the secure development philosophy.
- Burp Suite Enterprise Edition can detect a range of critical vulnerabilities.
- 'We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about
  you which we have grouped together as follows: Identity Data, Contact Data, Financial
  Data, Transaction Data, Technical Data, Profile Data, Usage Data, Marketing and
  Communications Data.'
- Best-in-class software and learning for security engineers and penetration testers.
- AI features are disabled by default.
- AI interactions are entirely user-initiated and controlled.
- You'll need a Burp Suite Professional subscription to take the exam.
- Any cheating will result in a permanent ban.
- The exam is open book - you may use any books, notes, or web resources you find
  useful.
- By default, AI features are disabled for all extensions to keep you in control of
  how and when Burp uses AI.
- AI features are only available in Burp Suite Professional version 2025.2 and later.
- Unused credits expire 12 months after purchase.
- AI credits are assigned to an individual user. They cannot be shared or pooled across
  multiple users.
- Professional
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Burp Proxy allows interception of HTTP requests and responses.
- Uses Burp Proxy to modify HTTP requests
- Congratulations, you've successfully set the target scope and used it to simplify
  your HTTP history.
- The server expects an integer value via the productId parameter.
- Burp Scanner is only available in Burp Suite Professional and Burp Suite DAST.
- Using Burp Scanner may have unexpected effects on some applications.
- You must include the appropriate file extension, in this case, .html.
- Some of the tools used in this testing workflow are only available in Burp Suite
  Professional.
- In Burp Suite Community Edition, your scope settings are lost when you close Burp,
  along with any other data.
- You can save the scope settings as part of a project file in Burp Suite Professional.
- Before you start mapping an application, it's a good idea to set Burp's test scope.
  This enables you to focus on the items that you're interested in.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Internal systems that shouldn't be publicly accessible.
- Hosts that may have been forgotten about and therefore aren't regularly updated.
- Dynamic URLs take more effort to audit than static URLs.
- URLs are classified as static if they don't accept any parameters in the URL or
  request body.
- Although sending an `OPTIONS` request sometimes causes the server to tell you which
  methods it supports, this information is often misleading or incomplete.
- In Burp Suite Community Edition, the rate at which Burp Intruder sends requests
  is restricted, so your attack will take significantly longer to run.
- Uses Param Miner to discover hidden inputs
- Select the type of hidden inputs to guess
- You can use the Inspector to perform URL and Base64-decoding, and to modify decoded
  data as you work.
- Burp Decoder can apply a wider range of different decoding and encoding functions
  to opaque data.
- Common errors can be found in the troubleshooting section.
- If tokens contain data encrypted with a CBC cipher, use the Bit flipper payload
  type instead of the Character frobber.
- Professional version only features are indicated
- To run these attacks on real websites, you usually need to also bypass defenses
  such as rate limiting.
- Credential stuffing relies on known username and password combinations.
- Defense mechanisms like account locking are ineffective against this type of attack.
- Session tokens must be generated in a way that makes them unpredictable.
- This attack may take some time.
- Professional version required for certain features.
- If Repeater is set to never follow redirects you will need to click Follow redirect
  to complete the login sequence.
- You can also use the Autorize extension from the BApp Store to compare requests.
- Some sites use insecure access controls based on request parameters.
- You can test the effect that these parameters have by using Burp Suite's match and
  replace rules.
- Burp's browser is an easy way to proxy HTTP traffic - even over the encrypted HTTPS
  protocol. There is no setup required.
- Although we've manually added a custom header in this case, Burp Suite provides
  a number of built-in match and replace rules to cover some of the most common use
  cases.
- Some applications rely on measures on the client side to control the data that they
  submit to the server.
- You can use Burp Proxy to intercept a request, then modify data in the HTTP request
  before forwarding it to the server.
- Common errors may occur during operations.
- Use Burp Scanner to automatically flag reflected input.
- Use Burp Repeater to manually identify reflected input.
- Stored XSS arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and
  includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The command may be executed after a delay.
- Use Burp Scanner to automatically flag potential directory traversal vulnerabilities.
- Use Burp Intruder to insert a list of directory traversal fuzz strings into a request.
- By default, all running tasks are paused when you reopen an existing project file.
- If you run a large number of concurrent tasks, we recommend configuring resource
  pools to manage and prioritize use of system resources.
- The HTTP history is always updated, even if Intercept is off.
- Right-click any item in the table to access further options.
- 'Filters only control what is displayed. If you hide items, they are not deleted:
  they reappear if you reset the filter.'
- To quickly toggle the filter on or off, click Filter on or Filter off.
- Using slow running or resource-intensive scripts can slow down Burp.
- 'The filters only control what is displayed. If you hide items, they are not deleted:
  they reappear if you reset the filter.'
- Common errors can be found in the Troubleshooting section.
- Using slow running or resource-intensive scripts can slow down Burp. Write your
  script carefully to minimize performance impact.
- Match and replace rules enable you to automatically replace parts of HTTP and WebSocket
  messages as they pass through the proxy.
- Burp executes enabled match and replace rules in turn for each message, making any
  applicable replacements.
- You should not disclose the private key for your certificate to any untrusted party.
  A malicious attacker in possession of your certificate and key may be able to intercept
  your browser's HTTPS traffic even when you are not using Burp.
- It's easy to use DNS to redirect client requests to the local listeners.
- The need for a special invisible proxy mode arises because the resulting requests
  will not be in the form that is expected by an HTTP proxy.
- Burp's support for invisible proxying allows non-proxy-aware clients to connect
  directly to a Proxy listener.
- In some cases, all the invisibly proxied traffic heads for a single domain. The
  non-proxy-aware client only ever contacts a single domain.
- In some cases, the proxied traffic heads for multiple domains.
- Burp AI doesn't retain conversation history. Include all necessary context in each
  prompt.
- Creating your own custom actions enables you to tailor Repeater to your workflow.
- Scripts can be as simple as a few lines of code, and small actions can be highly
  useful.
- Professional version required for certain features
- The option to send a message to the client is only available in connections that
  are still open via Burp Proxy.
- You can send a request to Repeater from a request that is already in Repeater -
  a new tab is created with another instance of the same request.
- The Connections settings are project settings. They apply to the current project
  only.
- The Message modification settings are project settings. They apply to the current
  project only.
- The Redirects settings are project settings. They apply to the current project only.
- The Streaming responses setting is a project setting. It applies to the current
  project only.
- The Default tab group setting is a project setting. It applies to the current project
  only.
- The Tab view setting is a user setting. It applies to all installations of Burp
  on your machine.
- Burp Suite does not require authentication for API access.
- Uses a Sniper attack to insert payloads into the username parameter.
- By default, Update Host header to match target is selected.
- The Sniper attack is useful for fuzzing a number of request parameters individually
  for common vulnerabilities.
- The Battering ram attack is useful where an attack requires the same input to be
  inserted in multiple places within the request.
- The Pitchfork attack is useful where an attack requires different but related input
  to be inserted in multiple places within the request.
- The Cluster bomb attack is useful where an attack requires unrelated or unknown
  input to be inserted in multiple places within the request.
- You can load your own directory of custom payload lists.
- Before you run an attack with one of the payload lists above, you need to replace
  placeholders with actual values.
- Resource pools make it easier for you to manage and prioritize the usage of system
  resources.
- Each resource pool can be configured with its own throttling settings.
- By default, attacks are saved in-memory, so they are lost if you close Burp Suite.
- Automatically following redirections may sometimes cause problems for your attack.
- You can carry out actions on the attack results as part of your workflow.
- Right-click on any item in the results table to access the actions in the context
  menu.
- If a valid identifier returns a response containing a specific expression, you can
  define a match grep item to identify responses that contain this expression.
- To test a large number of requests with the same payloads and match grep configuration,
  you can save or copy the tab's configuration.
- Burp automatically populates the site map from the sites you visit using Burp's
  browser.
- The context menu only shows actions that are relevant to the selected item.
- You can scan an entire branch of a tree if you select this action from the tree
  view.
- Wildcard expressions are not supported in URL prefixes for normal scope control.
- Regex is not supported when loading port or file information from a text file.
- Crawl paths view shows actions taken by Burp Scanner to reach each location.
- Some of these features are only available for editable requests.
- API JavaDoc available at https://portswigger.github.io/burp-extensions-montoya-api/javadoc/burp/api/montoya/MontoyaApi.html
- Common errors listed in the troubleshooting section
- Essential for exploiting a number of HTTP/2-exclusive vulnerabilities that were
  discovered by James Kettle.
- In read-only contexts, the message editor only displays the selected views if the
  message contains appropriate content.
- In editable contexts, all views are displayed, giving the option to add items even
  if none were included in the original request.
- You can view HTTP and WebSocket messages in various places throughout Burp Suite.
- In both the Pretty and Raw tabs, lines in requests and responses are automatically
  wrapped to fit the width of the text editor.
- By default, non-printing characters in HTTP requests and responses are hidden.
- The Collaborator server domain name may change, as we periodically add new domain
  names.
- By default, Burp Collaborator uses the domain in use when your version of Burp Suite
  Professional was released.
- If you have configured your Collaborator Server to use non-standard ports, then
  you must specify those ports here.
- Burp Scanner requests are not shown in the HTTP history, as they are not trafficked
  through a proxied browser.
- Items that are not captured will be discarded from Logger. Burp can't retrieve these
  items even if the capture filter is removed.
- Allocating a large amount of memory to Logger can cause performance issues.
- Capture filter scripts may slow down Burp's performance as they run against all
  outgoing HTTP messages. Using slow running or resource-intensive Bambdas can slow
  down Burp even further. Write your Bambda carefully to minimize performance implications.
- This tutorial showed you how to use Burp Logger to view requests made by a Burp
  extension.
- Burp Sequencer may have unexpected results in some applications. Until you are fully
  familiar with its functionality and settings, only use Burp Sequencer against non-production
  systems.
- Sequencer lets you perform an analysis with a sample of only 100 tokens, but this
  should not be considered reliable for any serious purpose.
- A sample of 5,000 tokens is usually sufficient, although this may depend on the
  sample's characteristics.
- Sequencer supports a maximum sample size of 20,000 tokens, for compliance with the
  FIPS standards.
- Sequencer settings are all project settings. They apply to the current project only.
- Character-level tests are deemed unreliable if the size of the character sets is
  too large relative to the number of samples.
- Uses standard statistical tests for randomness.
- Postmessage interception is disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the settings
  menu.
- Once enabled, web messages are automatically logged and flagged for vulnerabilities.
- If this setting is disabled, you can still spoof the origin of individual requests
  by selecting the Spoof origin checkbox when replaying the message.
- You can tell which messages DOM Invader generated because they do not have a numeric
  ID on the Messages view.
- Some websites trigger a large number of messages, which can make testing difficult
  due to the amount of noise.
- When this setting is enabled, DOM Invader compares the stack trace of each entry
  and hides any that point to the same location in the code as an existing entry.
- The byte-level comparison requires significantly more computing power. You should
  normally only use this option when a word-level comparison doesn't identify the
  relevant differences.
- The Target analyzer only analyzes the content already captured within the site map.
  Make sure that you have fully mapped all the application's content and functionality
  before you run this function.
- URLs are classified as static if they don't accept any parameters in the URL or
  message body. However, the responses from these URLs may still be dynamically generated
  by the application.
- Automatically add new items to the main site map as they're discovered.
- The cross-domain XmlHttpRequest (XHR) technique only works on modern HTML5-capable
  browsers that support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
- The CSRF PoC generator may display warnings if certain conditions are likely to
  occur.
- Burp Infiltrator should not be used on production systems or any other systems where
  availability, performance, or correct operation is required.
- Burp Infiltrator makes non-reversible changes to application bytecode.
- 'The filter and top search bar only control which items are displayed. If you hide
  items, they are not deleted from Burp: they reappear if you reset the filter.'
- The search dialog lets you configure several options for suite-wide searches.
- Selecting the Dynamic update option will cause Burp to dynamically update the results
  as new HTTP messages are processed by Burp tools.
- Custom actions can send requests and responses to other Burp tools.
- Lower temperatures produce better results for security-related applications. By
  default, the temperature is set to 0.5.
- Treat raw output from AI models as untrusted. Escape any AI-generated content before
  presenting it to users. Make sure that you use proper HTML encoding to neutralize
  potential threats.
- Only send essential data. For example, avoid including full HTTP requests if only
  specific headers or parameters are needed, and only send traffic that is in-scope
  for the application you are testing.
- Where possible, strip out sensitive data such as authentication tokens or session
  cookies.
- Use structured data formats like JSON instead of free-text input to prevent prompt
  injection.
- Validate and encode outgoing data before sending it, to prevent prompt injection
  or unintended execution.
- Define the AI's role using a system message. This helps set the context and behavior
  for the AI throughout the conversation.
- Provide relevant background information in the user prompt.
- Clearly specify what you want the AI to do.
- Lower temperatures (0.0 - 0.8) produce more predictable and accurate outputs. They
  are best used for technical or factual tasks.
- Higher temperatures (0.8 - 2.0) produce more creative and diverse outputs. They
  may cause the AI to produce inconsistent results, potentially making security-related
  responses unreliable. They are suitable for exploratory tasks.
- The default temperature is 0.5.
- Each check runs for a maximum of two minutes. If your code takes longer than this,
  Burp automatically interrupts the check.
- Slow or resource-intensive code can impact overall performance and make scans run
  more slowly.
- Uses Java for custom scan checks.
- Passive checks analyze traffic without modifying or sending any new requests.
- Active checks send additional, modified requests to probe for vulnerabilities.
- Uses custom scan checks to detect issues that only appear when requests are manipulated.
- The BChecks repository is for custom scan checks written in the BChecks language.
- Burp offers different customization options depending on your needs.
- The Montoya API enables you to integrate advanced AI features into your Burp Suite
  extensions.
