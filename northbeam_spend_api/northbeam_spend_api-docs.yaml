- Our current API accepts spend entries in batches of up to 1000 per API call.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Northbeam
- Certain attribution models and feature sets require a learning period of 30, 60,
  or 90 days before use.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Profitability cannot be utilized until you have passed the 90-day learning period
  with Northbeam.
- Data-driven e-commerce merchandising and more.

- Always use at least 30 days of data to ensure statistical significance.
- Remember, correlation doesn't imply causation.
- Northbeam's numbers will look different.
- Attribution is limited for Offline Channels (like Podcasts, Linear, DOOH, Direct
  Mail, and CTV).

  your campaigns and outcomes to uncover any insights that you may have missed from
  traditional reporting.
- We offer built-in tools and features designed specifically to help you find the
  most profitable and scalable strategies for better decision-making.
- Some orders may show up as unattributed, which is normal and expected to a certain
  extent.
- 'Unattributed revenue can occur for many different reasons: Use of an alternative
  checkout used (eg., CheckoutChamp, Recharge, etc), UTM parameters being stripped
  from URLs, Ad-blockers or privacy settings preventing Pixel firing, Traffic or purchases
  from third-party tools or marketplaces that bypass standard tracking.'
- Last Non-Direct Touch is the default model used by most in-platform reporting.
- Attribution Windows are only available using the Accrual Accounting Mode
- Cash Snapshot is useful for understanding the amount of money coming in on any given
  day (cash flow).
- Accrual Performance is meant to help understand the direct return of your marketing
  dollars and designed to show the full impact of marketing channels on your business.
- Our Subscription Metrics are based on Order tags.
- If you have multiple storefronts on different domains, it may make sense to create
  separate Northbeam dashboards for each store.
- Multi-dashboard configuration is supported!
- Northbeam supports both native integrations and custom APIs for spending and orders.
- Both Data-Client-ID and API Key are required for authentication.
- The default reporting currency is USD($)
- The spend data is normalized into a single currency even if you use different currencies
  in your ad accounts.
- Enable first-party tracking by creating an A Record named 'i'
- For domains using DNSSEC, add a CAA record to allow certificate issuance by Let's
  Encrypt
- If the pixel isn’t firing, we will not track which marketing channel(s) drove the
  associated Visit(s) and/or Conversion(s), and this data is not recoverable.
- Failing to notify our team may result in incorrect page view tracking.
- Failing to notify Northbeam may result in incorrect page view tracking.
- Must fire Northbeam Pixel on every page of the site.
- Scripts need to be added through Shopify’s Customer Events.
- Northbeam Pixel must fire on every page of your site.
- Any missing or incorrect historical pixel data cannot be recovered.
- It's extremely important that your firePurchaseEvent implementation is validated
  early to prevent lost data.
- Purchase conversion events are purchases that occur on your website.
- It's extremely important that these are captured on all your checkout flows.
- It's recommended that somebody with basic Javascript knowledge sets up the script.
- This script is limited to tracking event count.
- In order to track Email Sign Up events, please use our fireEmailCapture script.
- If you'd like to track a new custom goal, please get in touch with the Northbeam
  team and share the names of your custom goals so they can be recognized in the Northbeam
  system.
- Order Tags are the most important part of setup.
- Order tags are important for figuring out how ads are attributed to orders.
- Many Northbeam customers want to track ad attribution or revenue based on whether
  an order kicks off a new subscription or is part of a recurring one.
- Sometimes, you might want to exclude certain orders completely - like when you're
  analyzing ad attribution or revenue from your web store but also have orders from
  a brick-and-mortar store in your OMS.
- 'Common examples include: phone orders, customer service placed orders, gifting
  (influencers), replacements, warranty, cancellations, 3rd party retailer (Amazon,
  Walmart, Macys, etc.).'
- API currently accepts orders in batches of up to 1000 per API call.
- Use the ‘Data-client-ID’ and ‘API Key’ to upload your orders to Northbeam.
- The diagnostics tool will monitor for any errors in the Orders API upserts to the
  production endpoint.
- Sync as many orders as possible with a cadence of at least 2x faster than the number
  of times a day your pipeline runs.
- Our current API accepts orders in batches of up to 1000 per API call.
- Northbeam UTMs are required for active ads on integrated platforms to ensure accurate
  spend mapping and attribution.
- One of the motivations for the development of this API was to avoid using Spend
  sheets.
- Ensure your landing pages drive traffic to the domain linked to your Northbeam dashboard.
- Without the Pixel firing on all pages, critical attribution data could be incomplete.
- UTM parameters allow Northbeam to associate conversions with specific ad campaigns
  or channels.
- 'Accurate order attribution relies on two key data sources: Server Data and Pixel
  Data.'
- A 15% buffer is allowed due to ad blockers, VPNs, and other tracking restrictions.
- Before using the dashboard, it's important to ensure UTMs are inserted on your ads
  and that the UTMs are getting tracked by our pixel.
- Before using the dashboard, it's important to make sure that we're receiving data
  from our integrated ad platforms.
- Unattributed data is caused by missing pixel data.
- Orders that do not trigger the Northbeam Pixel will be Unattributed.
- If the discrepancy is very minor, it's often a timezone issue where your Northbeam
  dashboard timezone is different than your Ads Manager timezone.
- Ad performance discrepancies are expected.
- Northbeam’s attribution model and attribution window are different from legacy models.
- If refunds are deducted, historical revenue data will update when refunds are processed.
- We understand the tracking limitations in certain campaigns types and placements.
- The credentials used must have admin access to the Ad Account.
- If you're not currently using AppLovin, please contact AppLovin directly and request
  an eCommerce Account.
- AppLovin automatically appends the required UTM parameters in their latest UI.
- Duplicate spend entries in Northbeam may result in incorrect reporting and data
  discrepancies.
- Integration imports all Klaviyo events associated with the 'new subscriber' tag.
- Discrepancies in Revenue and Orders are expected.
- Northbeam will attempt to place UTM parameters on all newly created Meta ads from
  any ad accounts connected to your dashboard.
- The Northbeam Pixel doesn't fire on Meta Shops, so we don't track Visits.
- UTM Keys & Values Must Match Exactly
- Discrepancies in Revenue and Orders are expected due to different attribution models.
- X doesn't support dynamic UTM values. Your campaign/adset/ad names need to be hardcoded
  into utm_campaign, utm_term, and utm_content within your URLs.
- Discrepancies in Revenue and Orders are expected due to differences in attribution
  models.
- Ensure your Microsoft Account has 'Allow user consent for apps' enabled.
- Your Microsoft Account must be a Business Account.
- Attribution may be limited on specific channels.
- Channels with limited attribution include TV, Digital Out Of Home, and Audio.
- Enables view-through modeling data
- 'Ensure full coverage by creating two scheduled reports: nb_reporting_tm for this
  month and nb_reporting_lm for last month.'
- It could take up to 3 days for your MNTN data to fully backfill.
- The selector does not affect the integration—it is purely informational and highlights
  channels with limited attribution capabilities.
- This integration supports only Tatari ads using Streaming inventory, not Linear.
- Setting up Bliss Point Media involves getting AWS access keys and S3 Bucket Name.
- UTMs are key important here. We can ingest any Google Analytics UTMs as a fallback
  in the event Northbeam UTMs unavailable.
- UTMs are key for tracking visits, revenue, and transactions.
- Standard UTM parameters are supported.
- Meta Shops and TikTok Shops attribution are only supported using the Clicks Only
  or the Clicks + Modeled Views attribution models.
- The Northbeam Pixel doesn't fire on Meta Shops storefronts, so we don't track Visits.
- 'Two methods for tracking ads: Redirect Links and Pixel Placement.'
- The action iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy is required, as our system relies on it to
  validate the bucket permissions.
- Rate limits apply to various endpoints.
- For any platform where spend is not available via API, you can upload your spend
  manually via our Custom Spreadsheet.
- By default, we convert all currencies to US Dollars (USD) using the daily exchange
  rate.
- Currency change is a manual process in our backend. Once it's been deployed, all
  numbers in your dashboard are converted.
- Best Practices and Limitations of our Spend API
- Requires setup of connected app in Northbeam
- All Other Platforms Installation requires API authentication.
- Authentication required for API access.
- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of connected app in Northbeam
errors:
- No PII is accessible through the data exports.
