auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html:
  - 'A token is required for every request to the FME Flow REST API. The token can
    be provided in three ways: as an Authorization header with the format "fmetoken
    token=XXXXX", as a query string parameter named "fmetoken", or as a form parameter
    named "fmetoken" for requests with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    Header authorization is the preferred method for security reasons.'
  - 'REST API V2 uses token-based authorization via querystring parameter. Pass the
    token as a query parameter named "token" in requests, for example: http://myhost.com/fmerest/v3/repositories?token=YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE.
    The token should be obtained through the API authentication flow and included
    in all API requests requiring authorization.'
  - REST API V3 supports fmetoken as a querystring parameter or form parameter for
    authorization. Pass fmetoken=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX as a query parameter in the URL,
    or include fmetoken as a form parameter with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    API V2 used a token querystring parameter instead, which is no longer supported
    in V3.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes items
    array, limit integer, offset integer, and total integer fields to indicate the
    current page position and total results.
  - Use *limit* and *offset* query string parameters to control pagination. Responses
    include items array, limit, offset, and totalCount fields. Continue paginating
    by incrementing offset until all results are retrieved based on totalCount.
