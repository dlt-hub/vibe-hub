  - 'API key authentication is required and passed as a URL path parameter. Include
    your API key in the request URL path as the first segment after the API version:
    http://api.db-ip.com/v2/{apiKey}/... The apiKey parameter is mandatory for all
    requests.'
  - The API uses a public key for browser-based access. Paid users can enable their
    public key in the API dashboard. The public key is passed as part of the API endpoint
    URL (e.g., v2/free/self or v2/paid/{public_key}/...). For server-side or authenticated
    requests, users should refer to their API dashboard for key management. The Accept-Language
    HTTP header is used for localizing place names in responses.
  - Your API key is passed as a path parameter in the URL. The request format is http://api.db-ip.com/v2/{apiKey}/{ipAddressList},
    where apiKey is your API key and ipAddressList is a comma-separated list of IPv4
    or IPv6 addresses. No additional headers or authentication mechanisms are required.
  - Your API key or the string "free" for the free API should be included in the URL
    path as the apiKey parameter. Paid API access requires your unique API key in
    place of "free" in the request URL http://api.db-ip.com/v2/{apiKey}/{ipAddress}/{propertyName}.
  - Your API key should be included in the URL path as the apiKey parameter. Use the
    string "free" for the free API tier, or provide your actual API key. The format
    is http://api.db-ip.com/v2/{apiKey} where apiKey is either "free" or your assigned
    API key string.
