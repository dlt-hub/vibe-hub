notes:
- This is a community-supported theme.
- The jupyterLite lib is not yet providing a handle to switch from light to dark theme.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- By default, this theme will display the first five navigation links in the header.
- This prevents the header links from taking up so much space that they crowd out
  the UI components or spill off-screen.
- Don’t forget to add back the 'sidebar-ethical-ads.html' template if you are serving
  your documentation using ReadTheDocs.
- 'Modern web browsers do not allow loading data when the request is made from a page
  loaded via the file: protocol.'
- On narrow viewports, users can access search by clicking the magnifying glass icon.
- On wide viewports, the magnifying glass icon, search input field, and keyboard shortcut
  for focusing the search input field are all shown.
- This theme defines several CSS variables that can be used to quickly control behavior
  and display across your documentation.
- The native Sphinx option pygments_style will be overwritten by this theme.
- Plausible can be used to gather simple and privacy-friendly analytics for the site.
- By default this theme includes all of your documentation links in a collapsible
  sidebar.
- This may slow down your documentation builds considerably if you have a lot of documentation
  pages.
- If you’re hosting your documentation on ReadTheDocs, you should consider adding
  an explicit placement for their ethical advertisements.
- Your contributions are welcome!
- The Kitchen Sink was generated from the Sphinx Themes website, a community-supported
  showcase of themes for Sphinx.
- To have the inheritance-diagram render to SVG, set graphviz_output_format to 'svg'
  in conf.py.
- We do not recommend using this directive on pages that use this theme because PyData
  Theme provides an in-page table of contents in the right sidebar by default.
- Created using Sphinx
- Built with the PyData Sphinx Theme 0.16.1
- On most pages in this documentation, only a single top-level header is used.
- This theme is still under active development, and we make no promises about the
  stability of any specific HTML structure, CSS variables, etc.
- Create an 'edit this page' url compatible with bitbucket, gitlab and github.
- This theme is still under active development, and we make no promises about the
  stability of any specific HTML structure, CSS variables, etc. Make these customizations
  at your own risk, and pin versions if you’re worried about breaking changes!
- This theme may not work with the latest major versions of Sphinx, especially if
  they have only recently been released. Please give us a few months of time to work
  out any bugs and changes when new releases are made.
- You can control how many navigation levels are shown when a page is loaded using
  'show_nav_level'.
- To enable collapsing navigation items with captions, set 'show_nav_level' to 0.
- For a fully-customized Edit this Page URL, provide edit_page_url_template, a jinja2
  template string which must contain {{ file_name }}, and may reference any other
  context values.
- If you set `html_theme_options["announcement"]` to plain text or HTML, then to update
  the announcement banner you need to modify this string and rebuild your documentation
  pages.
- If you set `html_theme_options["announcement"]` to a URL string (starts with `http`),
  then you can edit the file at that URL to update the announcement banner.
- The switcher requires a JSON file to define versions.
- It is strongly recommended that you use either the search button and the hidden
  field or a persistent search field.
- The default value for back_to_top_button is True.
- Components are not provided by PyData Theme; they are provided by Sphinx Design.
- To use an external link to an image, make sure the html_logo begins with http.
- Note that the theme is defined with CSS variables and not SASS variables.
- Theming is still a beta feature, so the variables related to color theming are likely
  to change in the future. No backward compatibility is guaranteed when customization
  is done.
- Issues and pull requests to identify or fix accessibility issues on this theme or
  site are heartily welcomed.
- Plausible’s JavaScript will be included in all HTML pages to gather metrics.
- The dashboard with analytics results will be accessible at 'https://<plausible-url>/<my-domain>'.
- You can prevent pages from showing up in the navigation bar using a Sphinx extension
  called sphinx-remove-toctrees.
- 'If you prefer not to receive such warnings, there is a config value to suppress
  them: conf.py'
- The Read the Docs version switcher will be hidden any time the primary sidebar is
  hidden.
- Ethical advertisements are added to your sidebar by default.
- Bootstrap dropped its JQuery dependency and rewrote plugins to be in regular JavaScript.
- Sphinx v6 will do the same.
- Relevant for those using a custom.css and/or a custom.js file.
- Sometimes you want to update configuration values during a build.
- This theme is activated after config-inited is triggered.
- If you build the documentation locally without first generating these images you
  may get Sphinx warnings or errors, but this should be fine as long as the images
  build on ReadTheDocs tests.
- You must install `sphinx-theme-builder` and Pandoc.
- The `sphinx-theme-builder` will automatically install a local copy of `nodejs` for
  building the theme’s assets.
- In our CI workflow, we use a script to check for any warnings raised by Sphinx to
  assert that the only warnings are *expected* ones.
- The theme inherits its structure and section terminology from the Sphinx Basic NG
  theme.
- The default for `type` is `fontawesome`, so it is not required in the above examples
- You can add a button to each page that will allow users to edit the page text directly
  and submit a pull request to update the documentation.
- By design the indices pages are not linked in a documentation generated with this
  theme.
- Don’t forget to add back the "sidebar-ethical-ads.html" template if you are serving
  your documentation using ReadTheDocs.
- This is documentation for an old version.
- The switcher requires configuration steps including adding a JSON file and a configuration
  dictionary.
- 'Deprecated since version 0.15: Support for complex and multiple favicons will be
  dropped in version 0.15. Instead, use the sphinx-favicon extension.'
- For a complete list of the theme variables that you may override, see the theme
  variables defaults CSS file.
- The best source of information about changes to the theme will be the release changelog.
- If you prefer not to receive such warnings, there is a config value to suppress
  them.
- If a page has multiple top-level headers on it, then the in-page Table of Contents
  will show each top-level header.
- If the page only has a single top-level header, it is assumed to be the page title,
  and only the headers underneath the top-level header will be used for the right
  Table of Contents.
- The urlparse module is currently not entirely compliant with RFC 3986 due to defacto
  scenarios for parsing.
- Some parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained.
- This is documentation for an old version (0.16.0).
- This is documentation for an old version (0.14.4).
- The jupyterLite lib is not yet providing a handle to switch from light to dark theme.
  If you consider using it in your documentation you should also enforce the light
  theme to your users.
