auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.sitecore.com/:
  - An access token and client ID are both required and sent with every request. The
    access token can be created through the Content Hub interface or by requesting
    one using the API itself.
  - Authentication uses environment automation client credentials to generate a JSON
    Web Token (JWT), or alternatively OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow via a registered
    OAuth app. Client credentials must be created by an Organization Admin or Organization
    Owner in the Sitecore Cloud Portal under SitecoreAI Deploy > Credentials > Environment.
  - 'Edge Platform Admin API uses bearer token authentication. Generate the token
    in Sitecore Cloud Portal under your profile > API tokens, then include it in the
    Authorization header of every request as a bearer token.


    Audit API requires an access token and client ID, both sent with every request.
    The access token can be created through the Content Hub interface or requested
    via the API itself. The server URL must be set in the {{server}} variable.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow using client credentials grant type. To authenticate,
    POST to https://auth.sitecorecloud.io/oauth/token with form-encoded parameters:
    client_id (your automation client ID), client_secret (your automation client secret),
    grant_type set to "client_credentials", and audience set to "https://api.sitecorecloud.io".
    The response contains an access_token (JWT) in the "access_token" field with token_type
    "Bearer" and expires_in 86400 seconds (24 hours). Use the JWT as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header for API requests. Required scopes for Agent API are
    xmcloud.cm:admin, personalize.exp:mng, personalize.tmpl:r, and personalize.pos:mng,
    which must be requested from Sitecore Support during OAuth app registration. Cache
    the JWT and request a new one if you receive 401 Unauthorized responses.'
  - OAuth 2.0 with JSON web tokens (JWTs) is used for authorization. Create a Client
    ID and Client Secret in the Sitecore Cloud Portal under Admin > Brand Kit keys
    > Create credential. POST to https://auth.sitecorecloud.io/oauth/token with your
    Client ID and Client Secret to obtain a JWT access token. Include the JWT in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {YOUR_JWT}" for all API requests. The JWT expires
    in 24 hours; cache it to avoid repeated token requests, and request a new JWT
    if you receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
