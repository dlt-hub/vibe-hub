auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.payload.com/apis/api-design/:
  - 'API requests use HTTP Basic Authentication with a secret key. The secret key
    is passed as the username in the `-u` flag (format: `secret_key:` with empty password)
    or as the Authorization header using Basic auth encoding.'
  - Delete an individual object by sending a DELETE request to the resource endpoint
    with the object ID. Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with the secret key as
    the username and an empty password, passed via the `-u` flag. The secret key format
    is `secret_key_` followed by a unique identifier.
  - Payload API requires HTTP Basic Authentication using a secret key. The secret
    key is passed as the username in the `-u` flag (with an empty password), formatted
    as `secret_key_value:` in the Authorization header. For example, a secret key
    like `secret_key_3bW9JMZtPVDOfFNzwRdfE` is sent as the basic auth credential.
- information_source; https://docs.payload.com/apis/authentication/:
  - Payload uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The API secret key (found in Settings
    > API Keys) is passed as the username in the HTTP Basic Auth header. The secret
    key format is `secret_key_` followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `secret_key_3bW9JMZtPVDOfFNzwRdfE`).
    In Python, initialize a Session object with the secret key as the argument, and
    the library handles Basic Auth header construction automatically.
