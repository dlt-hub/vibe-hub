  - 'Authentication uses a token-based approach via the Keystone service. Include
    the token in the X-Auth-Token header with each request to the Neutron API endpoint.


    Required header: X-Auth-Token with the token value obtained from Keystone token
    generation. The token should be passed in the request headers when making API
    calls to the Neutron service endpoint (e.g., https://infra.mail.ru:9696).'
  - 'OpenStack Keystone token-based authentication. Send a POST request to the auth
    endpoint with identity credentials (username, password, domain name, project ID)
    in the JSON body. The response includes an `x-subject-token` header containing
    the auth token, which must be passed in subsequent API requests via the `X-Auth-Token`
    header. Required environment variables: OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME,
    OS_PROJECT_ID, OS_REGION_NAME.'

  - X-Auth-Token header is required for API requests. Pass the authentication token
    in the X-Auth-Token header with the value <token>. The token must be included
    in all requests to the Karboii API endpoint.

  - 'To use the Audit API, you need to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your
    account, obtain an access token named X-Auth-Token from the Keystone token endpoint,
    and include this token in the X-Auth-Token header when making requests to the
    Audit endpoint.


    Required header: X-Auth-Token with the access token value obtained from Keystone.
    Example request: curl -X GET "<Audit endpoint>/logs" -H "X-Auth-Token: <token>".'
- information_source; https://cloud.vk.com/docs/en/networks/cdn/concepts/secure-token:
  - 'Secure token authentication uses MD5-signed URLs with query parameters. The `md5`
    parameter contains an MD5 hash of a string composed of: secret key, link expiration
    time (Unix timestamp), file path, and optionally an allowed IP address. The `expires`
    parameter specifies the link expiration time as a Unix timestamp. Pre-signed URLs
    must be generated server-side by your website, and this feature requires enablement
    and configuration through technical support.'
