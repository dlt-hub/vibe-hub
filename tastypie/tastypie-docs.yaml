notes:
- Add `tastypie` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Create an `api` directory in your app with a bare `__init__.py`.
- Only users with ‘daniel’ in their username will be allowed in.
- Uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Requires setup of SessionAuthentication to access the API
- CSRF token needs to be included in the request headers
- By default, you get a paginated set of objects (20 per page is the default).
- Tastypie encourages round-trippable data.
- Don't put unauthorized write-enabled resources on the Internet.
- The default paginator contains the total_count value, which shows how many objects
  are in the underlying object list.
- Obtaining this data from the database may be inefficient, especially with large
  datasets, and unfiltered API requests.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Tastypie does not automatically create reverse relations.
- You can’t use just the class name for reverse relations.
- Authorization class is set to ReadOnlyAuthorization by default, preventing POST/PUT/DELETE.
- The no-op authentication option, the client is always allowed through. Very useful
  for development and read-only APIs.
- This authorization class only permits reading data, regardless of what the Resource
  might think is allowed. This is the default Authorization class and the safe option.
