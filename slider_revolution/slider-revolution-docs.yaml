- This option allows the slide timer to be paused while the video is playing.
- If this option is toggled to ON, after the video has completed it will start again

- If this option is toggled to ON, after the video has completed the module will transition
  to the next slide.

  slide and scrolling up proceeding to the next slide, then set the Reverse Scroll
  option to Reverse.
- The Scroll Target option is available as a troubleshooting tool, should you find

- The default rotateX Cycles values are [-50|50].
- The option is set in degrees(`deg`) of rotation.
- A positive value will appear to spin the shape counter clockwise in 3d space.
- A negative value will appear to spin the shape clockwise in 3d space.
- Default TranslateX Cycles values are [-50|50].
- A value of 0 will scale the characters to zero, effectively making them invisible.
- If you want to retain the correct aspect ratio, then any value change applied to
  scaleX should also be applied to scaleY.
- The default rotateY Cycles value is [-50|50].
- The default 2D Rotation Cycles value is [-50|50].
- In the above example, Split Delay has been set to 5 to more clearly illustrate how
  each word is actually animated separately.
- The default rotateX Random{min,max} values are [-15|15].
- The default rotateY Cycles values are [-50|50].
- The default 2D Rotation Cycles values are [-50|50].
- A positive value will appear to spin the shape counter clockwise in 3d space, i.e.
  the right edge will appear to move away while the left edge comes closer.
- A negative value will appear to spin the shape clockwise in 3d space, i.e. the left
  edge will appear to move away while the right edge comes closer.
- Default scaleX value is 1.
- The default scaleY Cycles values are [0.5|1].
- The default skewX Cycles values are [-50|50].
- A value higher than `0` and lower than `1` will scale the width down.
- A value above `1` will scale the width up.
- A value of `0` will scale the lines to zero, effectively making them invisible.
- The **Inherit** setting inherits the **scaleX** value from the previous keyframe.
- The **Random {min,max}** setting allows you to give lines a random **scaleX** value
  each time the animation runs.
- The **Cycles [val|val|val]** setting allows you to set multiple values to transition
  through across the course of the keyframe.
- You can specify as few or as many **scaleX Cycles** values as you would like.
- If you want to retain the correct aspect ratio, then any value change applied to
  **scaleX** should also be applied to **scaleY**.
- A **scaleY** value of `0.5` scales line height to `50%` of its default height.
- The default **scaleX Cycles** values are `[0.5|1]`.
- The default **scaleY Cycles** values are `[0.5|1]`.
- The **skewX** option is used to skew line shape horizontally at the selected animation
  keyframe.
- A positive value will skew the lines to the left.
- A negative value will skew the lines to the right.
- The default **skewX** **Cycles** values are `[-50|50]`.
- The **skewY** option is used to skew line shape vertically at the selected animation
  keyframe.
- A positive value will skew the lines down.
- A negative value will skew the lines up.
- By default, the scaleX field is set to 1, which means the words will have 100% of
  their default width.
- A value higher than 0 and lower than 1 will scale the width down.
- A value above 1 will scale the width up.
- A value of 0 will scale the words to zero, effectively making them invisible.
- You can specify as few or as many scaleX Cycles values as you would like.
- You will notice when scaleX values are adjusted in isolation, words can appear stretched
  or squashed.
- If you want to retain the correct font shape in your words, then any value change
  applied to scaleX should also be applied to scaleY.
- 'Color animation allows you to transition between colors of two types: text color
  and layer background color.'
- Line animation is designed for use with text layers
- The default **scaleY** **Cycles** values are `[0.5|1]`.
