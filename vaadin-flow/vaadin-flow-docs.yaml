  auth: The snippets mention the need for an API Key, which can be obtained from the
    Technical Setup documentation, and it should be applied as specified in the setup
    guide. Additionally, there is a reference to OAuth2 Authentication, indicating
    that a token may be required, which typically would be obtained through an OAuth2
    flow, though specifics on obtaining or applying the token are not provided.
  most_recurring_base_url: http://localhost:8080
  paginator: Pagination is required, and it can be applied using methods such as offset-based
    pagination, where the offset is specified by `query.getOffset()` and the limit
    by `query.getLimit()`, as well as by calculating the offset with `page * pageSize`
    and slicing the result array accordingly.
