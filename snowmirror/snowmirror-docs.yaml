auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.snow-mirror.com/doc/AdministratorGuide.html:
  - Basic authentication sends credentials (username and password) with every HTTPS
    request to ServiceNow. OAuth2 authentication (REST API only) sends credentials
    once to retrieve an access token. For OAuth2, choose either Resource Owner Password
    Credentials flow (requires username and password) or Client Credentials flow (requires
    Client Id). Proxy authentication is optional and uses Proxy Username and Proxy
    Password if the proxy server requires it.
  - "OAuth2 protocol is used for authorization with ServiceNow REST API. SnowMirror\
    \ uses the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant type. You must register SnowMirror\
    \ as an OAuth API endpoint in ServiceNow's System OAuth \u2192 Application Registry,\
    \ then configure SnowMirror with the Client Id and Client Secret obtained from\
    \ the ServiceNow registration. The OAuth2 access tokens are used instead of passing\
    \ credentials with each request."
  - "SnowMirror supports two authentication methods for ServiceNow: Basic Authentication\
    \ (username and password sent with every request, supported by SOAP and REST APIs)\
    \ and OAuth2 (using short-lived access tokens with client id and client secret,\
    \ supported only by REST API). OAuth2 supports two flows: Resource Owner Password\
    \ Credentials (username and password sent only on initial authentication or token\
    \ refresh) and Client Credentials (no username/password required). Configuration\
    \ requires entering Client Id and Client Secret in the Settings \u2192 ServiceNow\
    \ section and selecting the OAuth2 authentication protocol. When access tokens\
    \ expire, SnowMirror automatically obtains new tokens using refresh tokens."
- information_source; https://www.snow-mirror.com/doc/RestApiGuide.html:
  - SnowMirror API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the realm "SnowMirror API".
    Credentials must be provided in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme
    (base64-encoded username:password). A user account requires the Api Caller role
    to access the API, Synchronization Reader role to read data, and Synchronization
    Administrator role to perform modifications. The API returns 401 Unauthorized
    if credentials are missing or incorrect, and 403 Forbidden if the user lacks permission
    for the requested resource.
  - SnowMirror REST API uses basic HTTP authentication. You must include an "Authentication"
    header in every request containing the string username:password encoded in Base64.
    If the header is missing or credentials are incorrect, the API returns a 401 Unauthorized
    response with a WWW-Authenticate header set to Basic realm="SnowMirror API".
