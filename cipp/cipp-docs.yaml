notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The Contributor role should allow the identity to create and manage all types of
  Azure resources but does not allow them to grant access to others.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Some API endpoints may have rate limits.
- Ensure to handle OAuth token expiration gracefully.
- A Microsoft 365 Lighthouse license is needed to access various API endpoints used
  in CIPP but CIPP will function without it.
- 'Multi-Tenant Mode: A Microsoft Partner account with your clients’ tenants added.'
- CIPP uses Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) to deploy from GitHub.
- You must replace the preset 'Github Repository' and 'Github API Repository' fields
  with the URL's of your own Github fork of the CIPP repository.
- If the deployment fails, it's simplest to delete the resource group in the Azure
  portal and try again.
- If the deployment fails, delete the resource group in the Azure portal and try again
  for a clean slate.
- Remove `pull_request` triggers in both CIPP and CIPP-API repos to avoid conflicts.
- You can revert a discarded Pull app’s PR from the Closed Pull Requests section.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Invites expire after a specific amount of time.
- Link must be sent manually, it is not e-mailed.
- Invitations expire after a specific amount of time and must be sent manually.
- If you’re using a CyberDrain-hosted instance of CIPP, updates happen automatically—generally

  are added or existing features get updated for new requirements from Microsoft.
- Must be a Global Administrator while setting up the integration.
- Must be added to the AdminAgents group.
- 'MFA Setup: This account must have Microsoft MFA enforced for each logon.'
- Microsoft MFA is mandatory.
- If you sponsor with an organization GitHub account, please send in a message to
  helpdesk@cyberdrain.com with your personal GitHub username so that we can manually
  add that user to the portal. You cannot log in to the management portal with organization
  accounts.
- This account must have Microsoft MFA enforced for each logon.
- Both your, and your clients Conditional Access Policies will need to be configured
  for optimal usage.
- Exclude the CIPP service account from each existing policy, this way we have a dedicated
  policy for the CIPP service account.
- Enforce Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for each logon (set sign in frequency
  under session to every time) and for all cloud applications.
- Do not add any exclusions or trusted locations.
- If you have trusted locations under the classic MFA portal you must always remove
  those.
- Ensure to set up OAuth2 for authentication.
- Invites expire after a specific amount of time and must be sent manually.
- Exclude the CIPP service account from each existing policy for optimal usage.
- Create a new policy including the CIPP user and enforce Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
  for each logon.
- Do not add any exclusions or trusted locations to the CIPP specific policy.
- For clients' policies, add an exclusion to 'Users and Groups' for Guest or external
  users and Service Provider Users.
- Use the dedicated CIPP service account created during the preparation steps.
- Ensure your service account has a mailbox enabled to support email alerts.
- Invites must be sent manually to users as they expire after a specific amount of
  time.
- Custom roles created in CIPP do not sync back to the SWA role management or management
  portal.
- Tenants are cached for 24 hours within CIPP.
- CIPP requires its Service Account user to be a member of specific security groups
  with recommended roles for proper functionality.
- When using Single Tenant Mode CIPP runs in a somewhat more limited state - You are
  not able to add any other tenant to CIPP and it only works for the configured tenant.
- GDAP permissions will not apply and you must directly assign roles to the service
  account in the Entra portal.
- Any relationship that contains the Global Administrator/Company Administrator role
  will NOT be eligible for auto extend.
- CIPP runs in a somewhat more limited state in Single Tenant Mode.
- GDAP permissions will not apply in Partner Tenant Enabled mode.
- CIPP has various settings that can be configured based on user preferences.
- Notifications can be filtered or directed to specific locations.
- These roles are not currently configured with functionality within CIPP but will
  begin to be incorporated over time.
- Currently these are helpful for enabling them to do things in the native Microsoft
  portals.
- Sponsorship is required for onboarding services, whether using a hosted or self-hosted
  instance of CIPP.
- Select Setup Wizard from CIPP settings for easy set up of several of the basics
  needed to operate CIPP.
- If you sponsor with an organization GitHub account, please send in a message to
  helpdesk@cyberdrain.com with your personal GitHub username so that we can manually
  add that user to the portal.
- You cannot log in to the management portal with organization accounts.
- Requires setup of connected app in CIPP
- CIPP API requires proper setup for the connected app.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in CIPP
- Some API responses may include null values
- Standards reapply every three hours by default
- Deselecting a standard prevents it from being enforced in future cycles
- Some objects may require specific permissions to access.
- Standards are merged based on their specificity and creation date.
- By default, standards aren't applied to any tenants upon setup of CIPP.
- Some endpoints may require specific permissions to access.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- Some data may have rate limits
- Requires OAuth2 setup for connected app.
- The last 90 days of information is used for this report.
- Review Sharepoint sites and usage
- Some endpoints may require specific permissions.
- Enabling this feature will overwrite templates with the same name.
- CIPP recommends usage of a Customer Development Experience tenant for development
  of your templates.
- The task scheduler allows you to schedule CIPP functionality to be executed at a
  later date, and send the results to your PSA, Webhook, or email.
- Scheduling a task for the past will make it run on the next interval the scheduler
  runs.
- Clearing the cache can severely impact performance of your CIPP instance.
- Requires you to use your own Personal Access Token on the GitHub integration.
- A recurring task will return to a planned state directly after execution.
- Clearing cache can severely impact performance of your CIPP instance and will also
  remove any personal settings such as the selected theme.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Ensure correct permissions for API access.
- CIPP v7+ heavily relies on caching.
- If users in your organization have not accessed CIPP in a while, the Static Web
  App will put itself into a sleep state.
- All communication with Microsoft within CIPP requires multi-factor authentication,
  which cannot be disabled, ensuring every interaction is securely verified.
- API may have rate limits
- Use multi-factor authentication to access
- The token has expired
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- CIPP runs slow when first opened due to cold start.
- Ensure to properly configure the OAuth2 setup before making requests.
- You need tokens for a Secure Application Model (SAM) application
- The local.settings.json file stores the Secure Application Model tokens
- CIPP was built with a security-first approach.
- Access to CIPP is secured with EntraID SSO only, reducing the risks associated with
  inactive or stale local accounts.
- This adds your Graph Tokens as environment variables to your PowerShell session.
  This represents a security risk and you should use it only for testing / development
  purposes.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- This API provides various endpoints related to room management and mailbox reports.
- The API actions have a maximum timeout of 10 minutes.
- There are no active rate limits, but heavy usage of the API can cause frontend operations
  to slow down.
- Requires setup of Secure Application Model tokens
- Ensure to handle user permissions properly
- Running locally removes the SWA authentication aspect of the app, meaning that anyone
  on your LAN could connect to the instance.
- Speed and Security are two of the fundamental pillars of CIPP, if it isn't fast,
  it isn't good and, if it isn't secure, it's not getting merged.
- Make sure to create a personal access token and store it as a secret named 'PAT'
- API actions have a maximum timeout of 10 minutes.
- Requires appropriate OAuth permissions for accessing user and group data
- Requires authentication setup via Azure Active Directory
- Some features may have limited availability depending on tenant configuration
- CIPP API requires OAuth2 authentication with refresh tokens.
- CIPP is a comprehensive, open source platform supported by Microsoft.
- CIPP API requires OAuth2 authentication.
