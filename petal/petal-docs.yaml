  - User can generate their own API token via the Sign In API call. The token is returned
    in the Sign In response and must be provided with subsequent API calls to authenticate
    requests. API calls protected by a token are user-specific; the token locks access
    to that particular user's data. The "Register", "Send Instructions", and "Sign
    In" calls do not require a token. Based on the Open API spec shown, the Sign In
    endpoint accepts email and password in the request body as JSON and returns a
    bearer token in the AuthResponse.

  - Authentication uses a bearer token mechanism via the "authorization" security
    scheme. The token is sent in the request header as part of the standard bearer
    token pattern (configured in `/lib/petal_pro_api/api_spec.ex`). All endpoints
    in this controller are protected by this authentication requirement, indicated
    by the `security [%{"authorization" => []}]` declaration.
  - Bearer token authentication is required for API endpoints in the `:api_authenticated`
    pipeline. The `put_bearer_token` helper function generates a token for a user
    and injects an `authorization` header into the connection object, which the `:api_authenticated`
    pipeline validates to authenticate requests.
  - Bearer token authentication. Call `/api/sign-in` with email and password to receive
    a token in the response body. Include this token as a bearer token in the Authorization
    header for protected routes. Tokens are valid for thirty days by default.
- information_source; https://docs.petal.build/petal-pro-documentation/fundamentals/users-and-authentication:
  - Session-based authentication using a user_token stored in the session, retrieved
    via get_user(session["user_token"]). Protected routes use a require_authenticated_user
    plug/on_mount hook. Social login is handled via Ueberauth library supporting Google
    and Github OAuth providers, with redirect URLs generated as Routes.user_ueberauth_path(@conn,
    :request, "google") and Routes.user_ueberauth_path(@conn, :request, "github").
