auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.seer.cancer.gov/usage:
  - API key authentication is required and can be passed either as a query parameter
    named api_key or as an HTTP header named X-SEERAPI-Key with your API key value.
    Use api_key=YOURAPIKEY in the query string or set the X-SEERAPI-Key header to
    your API key in requests.
  - API key authentication is required, sent via the X-SEERAPI-Key header. Include
    your API key in the X-SEERAPI-Key request header for all API calls.
  - API key authentication passed as a query parameter named "api_key" in the URL.
    Include your API key value in the api_key parameter (e.g., ?api_key=YOURAPIKEY).
    A 401 status code indicates missing or incorrect authentication credentials.
  - SEER API uses API key authentication. Each user receives a unique API key from
    their Account page after creating a free account via Login.gov. The API key must
    be attached to every request either as the X-SEERAPI-Key HTTP header (preferred
    method) or as an api_key query parameter (less secure, testing only). All communication
    must use HTTPS.
  - The API uses an API key authentication scheme. Send the API key in the `X-SEERAPI-Key`
    header with each request. Replace "YOURAPIKEY" with your actual API key value.
