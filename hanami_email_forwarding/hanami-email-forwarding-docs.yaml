notes:
- We don't store email by default, and we never read your email.
- We don't track you. This website has no analytic whatsoever.
- We don't store or log your email. If you EXPLICITLY enable 'Mail Log', then we will
  store your emails so that you can inspect and debug email flows or webhooks.

- 'SMTP Logging: email sent through our SMTP service are always being logged regardless
  of your logging setting.'
- During beta period, the first time an IMAP sync is initiated, only the last 2000
  emails are returned.
- We never store your emails unless explicitly requested.
- Mail logs feature is disabled by default and requires explicit consent to enable.
- This feature requires Professional or a higher plan.
- Webhook has a short storage time for emails before posting.
