  - The RStudio Connect API uses API key authentication. Credentials consist of a
    server URL (e.g., https://rsc.example.com/) and an API key generated from the
    user's account settings. The API key should be stored securely in environment
    variables such as .Renviron and never published in public repositories. The documentation
    indicates the API key is used to identify and authenticate API users, though the
    specific header name or parameter format for sending the key is not provided in
    this excerpt.
