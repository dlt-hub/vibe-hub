notes:
- API versions are different from the Testlink web versions.
- Playwright is an open-source automation library designed for end-to-end testing
  of web applications.
- Supports multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
  Java, and C#.
- TestLink tool has not been updated for more than four years and may no longer be
  maintained or supported by the application vendor.
- Git is a distributed version control system.
- Git is cross-platform. It can run on various operating systems.
- Pay as you go model for API usage
- Software testing is an integral part of the Software Development process, contributing
  significantly to its success.
- Software Testing plays a critical role in delivering high-quality digital experiences.
- It protects users from bugs, ensures smooth performance, and builds trust in the
  product.
- Testing is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC).
- The main purpose of testing is to ensure that the software works as expected and
  is free from bugs.
- Bugs can range from minor glitches to major problems that cause the software to
  crash or malfunction.
- Testers report any variance between the expected and actual results during the test
  case execution as bugs in the bug reporting tool for further investigation by the
  development team.
- Software testing goals can be classified as Primary or secondary.
- Short-term goals are known as immediate goals because the results are immediate
  after performing software testing.
- Long-term goals are also known as ultimate goals.
- Black box testing is essential in software testing, as it helps to ensure that the
  software product meets the end user’s needs and expectations.
- White box testing examines an application or system’s internal structure, source
  code, program logic, and internal workings.
- Positive testing is also known as Happy Path testing or Affirmative testing.
- The primary objective of positive testing is to affirm the correctness and accuracy
  of the system’s responses to valid inputs.
- Negative testing is a type of software testing that checks how the system handles
  unexpected or invalid inputs or scenarios.
- Common examples of negative testing include entering invalid data into form fields,
  exceeding system limits, disrupting network connections, and manipulating input
  files.
- Static testing is usually performed early in the development lifecycle.
- Static testing helps ensure that software meets regulatory and compliance requirements.
- Static testing is resource-intensive and time-consuming.
- Code coverage testing is a critical part of the software development process.
- By ensuring that most of your code is tested, you can significantly improve the
  reliability and performance of your application.
- It’s important to focus on test quality and practical coverage targets, rather than
  simply aiming for a high percentage.
- Ulaa Browser provides various modes tailored for specific browsing needs.
- Accenture plans to lay off more than 11,000 employees globally.
- Layoffs are primarily due to reduced spending by clients in key industries.
- The tariff targets specific pharmaceutical products, primarily certain generic drugs
  and active ingredients.
- Tariffs can be adjusted or removed based on trade negotiations or policy changes.
- Alibaba is rapidly transforming into a technology and AI-driven enterprise.
- The sudden $100,000 fee for new H-1B petitions marks a sweeping shift in U.S. immigration
  policy toward skilled workers.
- Google rolled many features to free Chrome users in the U.S. for desktop as part
  of the September 2025 update
- Some features may require updating Chrome to the latest release or enabling experimental
  flags for early access
- Managing environments helps developers test the same API in multiple contexts without
  rewriting requests.
- Reference your environment variables so credentials aren’t hard-coded into individual
  requests.
- Projects keep chats, files, and custom instructions in one place
- Edge updates typically include important security fixes and quality improvements.
- OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom to co-design and produce a custom AI chip,
  which will be manufactured using advanced 3 nm technology and used internally starting
  in 2026.
- The model is optimized for efficiency, meaning it consumes fewer resources while
  still producing high-quality images.
- Availability, pricing, credit amounts, and exact features can vary by country and
  change over time. Always check Google’s latest plan pages and Labs documentation
  for current details.
- The Google Pixel 8a is available at a discounted price.
- The price drop is strategic to clear inventory before the Pixel 9a launch.
- AI now handles about 50% of customer conversations at Salesforce.
- Proposed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act
- Targets high-performance AI chips like Nvidia's H100 and AMD's Instinct MI308
- Investing in AI stocks requires a balanced approach due to their potential for high
  growth and volatility.
- AI stocks can be risky due to market volatility, high valuations, and regulatory
  uncertainties.
- An Epic is like a big user story that needs to be broken down into smaller user
  stories.
- 'Bug priorities available: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest'
- 'Bug statuses include: OPEN, IN PROGRESS, REOPENED, RESOLVED, CLOSED, TO DO, DONE'
- TestNG handles many of the tasks needed for test case automation and management.
- Tests and suites are specified using the configuration 'testng.xml' file.
- TestNG is open-source and provides an API for adding custom implementations.
- TestNG is a popular Java testing framework offering various features to enhance
  test development and execution.
- One of the most common error that is usually made is adding a dependency on a disabled
  test.
- In the TestNG framework, we can specify the expected exceptions to @Test annotation
  using the attribute 'expectedExceptions='.
- The parameter is at suite level so its common for all the tests in the suite.
- We can group multiple test methods into one group.
- We can execute the test methods that belong to the group.
- TestNG guarantees that the methods depended upon will be run before the test method
  that contains this annotation.
- Dependency is a handy tool in TestNG framework to make some methods run in the order
  you specify.
- SoftAssert allows all assertions to run, even if they fail.
- Ensure to use the latest version of TestNG.
- Handle illegal characters in assert messages to avoid file saving errors.
- Select an archetype for the project, e.g., maven-archetype-quickstart.
- Resolve Dependencies during Pom parsing.
- TradingView is a cloud-based charting and social networking platform that provides
  real-time market data.

- Trading stocks, cryptocurrencies, or any financial instruments involves risk, and
  past performance does not guarantee future results.
