auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.checklyhq.com/:
  - 'API authentication can be configured at the check level using setup scripts.
    In the setup script, you can fetch tokens dynamically and set them in request
    headers. For example, retrieve a token via fetchToken() and assign it to the Authorization
    header as Bearer token: request.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`. The
    Authorization header is the standard location for passing authentication credentials
    to API endpoints.'
- information_source; https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/api-checks/set-up-and-tear-down/:
  - A static bearer token stored in the environment variable AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN is
    sent in the authorization header to authenticate requests. Pass the token via
    the authorization header as process.env.AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN when making HTTP requests
    to the authentication server.
  - Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header. The setup script retrieves
    a token by calling getToken() and sets it in the request.headers['Authorization']
    field as "Bearer {token}". The getToken() function reads the AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN
    environment variable to authenticate requests to the token server.
- information_source; https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/guides/monitoring-the-stripe-api/:
  - 'GitHub GraphQL API uses bearer token authentication. Send your GitHub token in
    the Authorization header as "Authorization: bearer <GITHUB_TOKEN>". The token
    should be a valid GitHub personal access token or OAuth token with appropriate
    permissions for the resources you''re querying.'
  - 'Stripe API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a secret API key. The API key
    is passed as the username in the `-u` parameter (colon-separated format: `api_key:`),
    with an empty password. For example, use `-u sk_SOME_KEY....:`
    in curl, or set the Authorization header to `Basic base64(api_key:)` in other
    HTTP clients.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/guides/monitoring-the-stripe-api/:
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter to specify the number of results returned
    per request. The API also supports filtering by creation date using the created
    parameter, though the documentation does not explicitly describe response fields
    for navigating between pages or indicate how to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Use `first` or `last` parameters in GraphQL queries to paginate results. `first`
    requests forward pagination (with optional `after` cursor), `last` requests backward
    pagination (with optional `before` cursor). Response includes `edges` array with
    `node` objects and `pageInfo` containing `hasNextPage`, `hasPreviousPage`, `startCursor`,
    and `endCursor` to construct subsequent requests.
