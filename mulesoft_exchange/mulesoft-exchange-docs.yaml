- Data is processed in in-memory, so if you do parallel processing (such as running
  multiple flows in one go), you might encounter an out-of-memory issue. For example,
  if you process 1 MB files in three flows, around 3 MB files will be loaded in-memory.
  This is due to the nature of Apache Tika and LangChain4j libraries.
- Certain vector stores and LLMs are marked as beta. These are early-stage integrations
  that may change based on stability, demand, or provider updates.
