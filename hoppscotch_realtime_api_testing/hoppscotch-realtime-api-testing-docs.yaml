notes:
- To enable desktop app support for your self-hosted Hoppscotch instance, make sure
  to update the `WHITELISTED_ORIGINS` environment variable in your `.env` file with
  your deployment URL.
- REST APIs are stateless, which means that the server does not store any information
  about the client.
- GraphQL enables you to fetch data from multiple APIs in a single query thus helping
  you build better-performing applications.
- Currently, organizing requests across multiple shared workspaces is limited to RESTful
  protocol. GraphQL and Realtime APIs are available only in the personal workspace
  and are not supported for collaboration in shared workspaces.
- Persisting responses may impact performance for large collections.
- Personal Access Tokens have read-only access permissions and cannot be modified
  once generated.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
