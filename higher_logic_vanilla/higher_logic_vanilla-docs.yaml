notes:
- Make sure this secret stays on your server; otherwise, your authentication may be
  compromised.
- Currently, there's no official way to disable the regular JWT SSO.
- If a smart ID resolves to multiple rows, or none at all, a fatal error will be generated.
- A smart ID must resolve to exactly one row.
- The 5,000 record limit is only available when exporting to CSV. If making a standard
  API call, the limit is 500 users.
- Role tokens are valid for one to three minutes, with expiration every two minutes.
- Role tokens should be passed as a role-token query parameter.
- New endpoints will be available as they are completed.
- Results per page can be lower than the limit due to user permissions.
- Co-Deploy goes a step further, allowing Enterprise+ customers to fully customize
  and extend their Vanilla forums to meet specific brand requirements and business
  objectives.
- Code collaboration is limited to the official client repository under our organization
  on GitHub.
- All code changes must be submitted for review via pull requests.
- Each customer is limited to 8 collaborators.
- All code authored by Vanilla staff remains the property of Vanilla.
- HLV does not engage in code reviews on customer code.
- Outputs are generated through machine learning processes and are not tested, verified,
  endorsed or guaranteed to be accurate, complete or current by Higher Logic.
- Spoofing is a powerful tool, but it requires caution because you're allowing access
  to other user accounts.
- Only ever spoof with an access token on the server. Never pass spoof headers in
  the client with JavaScript, in a mobile app, etc.
- Do not use spoofing as a workaround for SSO. Think of spoofing as a tool for administrators
  or server integrations such as automated posts on behalf of users.
- When you spoof as a user, the API call will be as that user and will be limited
  by that user's permissions.
