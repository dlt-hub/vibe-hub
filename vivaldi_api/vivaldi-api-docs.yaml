notes:
- Some API calls may require additional parameters to function correctly.
- Ensure OAuth2 is configured correctly for data access.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- OAuth requires setup of connected app in Vivaldi
- Mail accounts hosted may have connection issues under certain conditions.
- OAuth2 authentication is required for accessing Vivaldi APIs.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- A place to talk about Vivaldi on your mobile devices.
- This is a bug in the Vivaldi 7.6 version. The Vivaldi team is aware of it and I
  hope we get a fix in one of the next minor updates.
