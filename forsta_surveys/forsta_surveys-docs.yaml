  - 'API authentication uses an x-apikey header. Include the header "x-apikey: API_KEY"
    (or "x-apikey: MY_API_KEY") in all requests, where API_KEY is your actual API
    key value. The header must be passed with both GET and POST requests.'
  - 'API key authentication is required via the `x-apikey` header. Pass your API key
    in the header `x-apikey: API_KEY` with all HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
    Username and password authentication is not available for web calls.'
  - All web calls must include your API key in the x-apikey header. The API key should
    be passed as a custom header named x-apikey with your authentication credentials
    as the value.
  - The recommended authentication method for the Forsta Surveys REST API is a permanent
    API key. Temporary keys can be generated via a hyperlink and used when prompted,
    with the key saved to a configuration file at /home/pagov/.config/decipher. The
    exact mechanism for passing the API key in requests (header name, query parameter,
    etc.) is not specified in this documentation.
