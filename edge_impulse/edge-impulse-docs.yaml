notes:
- We support any edge AI hardware that can run C++, and more!
- During the integration and when possible, we leverage and integrate the hardware
  capabilities.
- Edge Impulse has developed a suite of tools to help you interact with the platform
  and streamline your edge AI workflow.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Edge Impulse
- Projects are created by members of the Expert Network.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- A project can contain multiple impulses, also known as experiments.
- Training and deploying high performing ML models is usually considered as a continuous
  process rather than a one time exercise.
- Live classification lets you validate your model with data captured directly from
  any device or supported development board.
- Quantized (int8) model is not enabled by default and the first step of enabling
  is in the settings menu beside the Classify all button.
- Make sure to label your samples exactly as `anomaly` or `no anomaly` in your test
  dataset so they can be used in the F1 score calculation for anomaly detection projects.
- Currently only available for Audio data projects
- Versioning is an essential feature for managing machine learning projects in Edge
  Impulse.
- Performance Calibration gives you an accurate prediction of how your ML pipeline
  will perform when it is deployed in the real world
- Only available on the Enterprise plan
- Files with the same name but with a different hash are overwritten
- Some features require an Enterprise plan.
- 'Edge Impulse offers two plans to suit your needs: the Developer plan and the Enterprise
  plan.'
- Optimized for edge devices
- Supports various file types including .cbor, .json, .csv, .wav, .jpg, .png, .mp4,
  and .avi
- Requires setup of connected app in Edge Impulse
- Some data may be subject to usage limits
- Registration is straightforward, granting you immediate access to the comprehensive
  suite of tools and resources.
- Designed specifically for deploying machine learning models on edge devices
- Supports data coming from multiple sources, in any format
- An Edge Impulse API key can be obtained through your Edge Impulse Studio project’s
  dashboard.
- A JWT token can be acquired via the Edge Impulse API request with your Edge Impulse
  username and password.
