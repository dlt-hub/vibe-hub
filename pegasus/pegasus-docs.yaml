notes:
- Pegasus can detect configuration files in locations different than the default.
- Pegasus is available for Windows 7 or later, and should work out of the box.
- Video playback has a high battery drain
- Unmounting the SD card while Pegasus is running may force close it
- If you're launching a memory-intensive application, the Android OS may decide to
  close Pegasus
- Shutdown and reboot are not available due to Android restrictions
- Check the path in most file manager apps, look for something like 'file details'
  or similar.
- Depending on your settings, the system may not allow running programs from USB drives
  or Windows file systems.
- On the Raspberry Pi, the official builds require Raspbian Buster or later.
- All Raspberry boards are supported, however the releases are generally not interchangeable.
- Pegasus requires at least 64 MB of video RAM.
- A desktop installation (X11) is not required, so you can also use the 'Lite' versions
  of Raspbian on your boards.
- You will need RetroPie version 4.6 (released on April 28, 2020) or later to successfully
  install Pegasus.
- 'If your directory names contain spaces, don''t forget to wrap the parameter in
  quotes, eg.: "/my custom cores/mgba_libretro.dylib"'
- You can also add the launch field to games too, in case some of them require a specifix
  emulator to work.
- Metadata files can be edited via a text editor or the graphical metadata editor.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The package names and activity names are case sensitive!
- In most cases this is a codec issue.
- Themes are stored in the themes directory.
- You might see .qmlc files popping up in your theme's directory. These are cache
  files, generated for faster loading.
- Uses virtual pixel values for scaling on different resolutions.
- Setting up the keyboard input also makes gamepads work.
- Loading image files takes some time depending on the device Pegasus runs on. If
  asynchronous is set to false, the program will not react to input until the image
  is loaded.
- Don't forget to change ListView to PathView in the delegate.
- Uses Image and Text components for displaying game metadata
- Rating is shown only if greater than 0%
- Manually building requires C++11-supporting compiler and Qt 5.15 or later
- At least Qt 5.9 is required, with 5.12 or later recommended for better performance
  on embedded platforms.
- Cross compiling Qt is not trivial, you'll need some experience setting it all up.
- Building Qt takes significant time, about 30-60 minutes on a good desktop PC, depending
  on the selected components.
- The sysroot used for compilation is based on Raspbian, with additional packages
  installed.
