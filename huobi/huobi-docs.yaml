auth_info:
- information_source; https://huobiapi.github.io/docs/dm/v1/en/:
  - Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based request signing. Include AccessKeyId,
    SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256, SignatureVersion=2, and Timestamp as query parameters.
    Create a canonical string from HTTP method, host, path, and sorted query parameters,
    then sign it with your API Secret Key using HmacSHA256, base64-encode the result,
    and add the Signature parameter to the request URL.
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Required parameters include AccessKeyId,
    SignatureMethod (HmacSHA256), SignatureVersion, Timestamp, and Signature. The
    Signature is computed using HMAC-SHA256 over a formatted string containing the
    HTTP method (GET), host (api.hbdm.com), path, and query parameters sorted by ASCII
    order with URI encoding. Optional cid parameter for client requests; ticket parameter
    also supported. All data is case-sensitive.
- information_source; https://huobiapi.github.io/docs/spot/v1/cn/:
  - API requests require HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. For REST APIs,
    include AccessKeyId, SignatureMethod (HmacSHA256), SignatureVersion (2), Timestamp,
    and Signature as URL query parameters. For WebSocket, send the same parameters
    in a JSON object with authType set to "api", using signatureVersion "2.1" instead.
    The Signature parameter is computed from request data using your secret key and
    must be URL-encoded for REST calls.
- information_source; https://huobiapi.github.io/docs/spot/v1/en/:
  - API Key Permission Trade is required. The endpoint uses standard API key authentication
    where the API key must have Trade permission level. Rate limit is 2 requests per
    2 seconds.
  - 'API Key Permission required with Read access. Send requests to GET /v1/margin/accounts/balance
    endpoint with API Key authentication (header-based, exact header name not specified
    in excerpt). Optional parameters: symbol (string) and sub-uid (int) in query string.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://huobiapi.github.io/docs/dm/v1/en/:
  - Pagination uses current_page and total_page fields in the response. Request the
    next page by incrementing current_page parameter in the next request. Stop when
    current_page exceeds total_page. total_size indicates total number of records.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page_index (which page, default value
    not specified) and page_size (default value not specified). Response includes
    total_page, current_page, and total_size fields to indicate pagination state.
  - Pagination uses query parameters current_page (required, int) and total_page (required,
    int) in responses. Response includes total_size (int) for total result count.
    Construct next request by incrementing current_page until it equals total_page.
  - 'Responses include pagination fields: total_page (total pages), current_page (current
    page number), and total_size (total items on current page). To paginate, construct
    subsequent requests using the current_page value incremented by one until current_page
    reaches total_page.'
  - The endpoint supports pagination via the size parameter (query string, optional,
    default 48) to control the number of records returned per request. The response
    does not explicitly indicate pagination fields like next, has_more, or cursor,
    so the pagination mechanism appears limited to controlling batch size rather than
    supporting sequential page navigation.
