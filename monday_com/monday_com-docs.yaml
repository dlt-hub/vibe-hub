  - API tokens are used to authenticate requests to the monday.com API. Generate a
    token via your account's Developer > My Access Tokens section, then include it
    in requests (token permissions are scoped to the user's own permissions). Tokens
    can also be generated via OAuth Authorization Flow with limited scopes tied to
    specific apps.
  - All requests to the monday.com GraphQL API require POST requests to api.monday.com/v2
    with an API token passed as the Authorization header. The token should be sent
    in the Authorization header with the value being your API key directly, and the
    Content-Type header must be set to application/json.
