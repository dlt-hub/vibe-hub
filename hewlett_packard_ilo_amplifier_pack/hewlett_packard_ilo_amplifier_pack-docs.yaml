auth_info:
- information_source; https://hewlettpackard.github.io/iLOAmpPack-Redfish-API-Docs/:
  - Authentication is required for all Redfish API resources except the root `/redfish/v1/`
    endpoint. Basic Authentication is supported using HTTP Basic Auth with username
    and password credentials passed via the Authorization header in the format "Basic
    base64(username:password)". Unauthenticated requests to protected resources return
    HTTP 401 Unauthorized with error code "Base.1.1.NoValidSession".
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are passed as username and password
    using HTTP Basic Auth (the `-u` flag in curl or the `username` and `password`
    parameters in the redfish Python client). The iLO Amplifier Pack server URL is
    the base endpoint, typically in the form https://{iLOAmpServer}.
  - Session-based authentication is used. After login via POST to SessionService/Sessions
    with username and password credentials, the server returns an X-Auth-Token header
    value that must be included in subsequent requests as the X-Auth-Token header.
    A session cookie (HttpOnly; Secure) is also set and should be maintained for the
    session.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Provide username and password to the redfish_client
    constructor with parameters username and password, then call the login method
    with auth="basic" to establish a session before making requests.
  - 'To create a session, POST a JSON object to `/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/`
    with `Content-Type: application/json` header. The response includes an `X-Auth-Token`
    header containing your session token and a `Location` header with the session
    URI. Include the `X-Auth-Token` value as a header in all subsequent requests.
    To log out, DELETE the session URI from the `Location` header.'
