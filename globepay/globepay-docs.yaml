auth_info:
- information_source; http://docs.globepayinc.com/api/route/index.html:
  - All Razorpay APIs use Basic Authentication. Generate API Keys from the Dashboard
    and use the Key ID as the username and Key Secret as the password in the Authorization
    header with Basic Auth scheme.
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, here is the authentication information:


    HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Include your API credentials using the
    format `-u <YOUR_KEY_ID>:<YOUR_KEY_SECRET>` in the request, where YOUR_KEY_ID
    is your API key and YOUR_KEY_SECRET is your API secret. These credentials are
    passed as HTTP Basic Auth in the Authorization header.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication using a key ID and key secret pair provided via the
    `-u` flag. The credentials are formatted as `<YOUR_KEY_ID>:<YOUR_KEY_SECRET>`
    and sent as HTTP Basic Authentication in the Authorization header.
  - Basic authentication is required. Include your API credentials using the `-u`
    flag with format `<YOUR_KEY_ID>:<YOUR_KEY_SECRET>` in the Authorization header,
    or pass them as username:password in HTTP basic auth.
  - Razorpay uses HTTP Basic Authentication with API key credentials. Send your Razorpay
    KEY_ID and KEY_SECRET as username and password in the Authorization header using
    the format `username:password` encoded in Base64, or use curl's `-u` flag with
    `KEY_ID:KEY_SECRET`. The `content-type` header must be set to `application/json`.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.globepayinc.com/api/payments/index.html:
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters: count (number of results per page, default
    2), skip (number of results to skip, default 0), and from (Unix timestamp to filter
    results from). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the skip value.'
  - Use the `count` query parameter (default 10, maximum 100) to specify number of
    records per request, and the `skip` query parameter to specify how many records
    to skip for offset-based pagination. By default, only the last 10 records are
    returned.
