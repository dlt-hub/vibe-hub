auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/en/business-auth/rest-api:
  - 'Kakao Business API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow for authentication. To
    obtain a business token, send a POST request to https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/business/token
    with Content-Type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8
    and request body parameters: grant_type (fixed value "authorization_code"), client_id
    (Service app REST API key), code (Business authorization code), and redirect_uri
    (callback URI). The response returns token_type (fixed as "Bearer"), access_token
    (the business token to use in subsequent requests), and scope (granted permissions).
    Use the returned access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}"
    for authenticated requests.'
  - Make a GET request including the service app's REST API key as a parameter to
    initiate the business consent screen. The Kakao API server redirects the authorization
    result as a query string to your registered redirect_uri, containing either a
    code and state (success) or error and error_description (failure) that must be
    checked and handled accordingly.
  - Make a POST request to revoke a business token by including the business access
    token in the Authorization header with Bearer scheme. The header name is Authorization
    and the format is "Bearer {BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN}".
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication. Include the business access token
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer ${BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN}".'
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the business access token in
    the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer ${BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN}".
    The token should be passed as an environment variable or configuration value named
    BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/en/kakaologin/rest-api:
  - Use limit query parameter (optional, integer) to specify number of users per page,
    from_id (optional, long) for starting service user ID, and order (optional, string)
    for search direction. Response includes URLs for previous and next pages when
    results span multiple pages.
- information_source; https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/en/kakaotalk-social/rest-api:
  - Use offset and limit query parameters to paginate. offset specifies the starting
    position (default 0), limit specifies results per page (default 3 in examples).
    Response contains elements array; construct next request by incrementing offset
    by limit value and repeating the request.
- information_source; https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/en/talkcalendar/rest-api:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (default 0) and limit specifies the number of results per page (example
    shows limit=4). Continue paginating by incrementing offset by the limit value
    until fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - Use the limit query parameter (optional) to control page size. The response includes
    an after_url field for retrieving the next page; stop paginating when after_url
    is not present in the response.
- information_source; https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/talkcalendar/rest-api:
  - Pagination uses a limit parameter in the request body to specify page size, and
    responses include an after field containing a URL for fetching the next page.
    Continue paginating by requesting the after URL until no after field is returned
    in the response.
