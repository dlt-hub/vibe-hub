auth_info:
- information_source; https://cesium.com/learn/ion/rest-api/:
  - 'API tokens are used for authentication. Tokens are returned as JWT values in
    the response field "token" and should be sent in the Authorization header with
    the Bearer scheme (e.g., Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...).
    Tokens have associated scopes that control permissions, and specific scopes like
    "profile:read" must be granted for token operations. Invalid credentials return
    a 401 error.'
  - 'All Cesium ion endpoints require an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token sent in the Authorization
    header. The format is "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>". The API supports
    multiple scopes including assets (scope details appear to be cut off in the provided
    documentation).'
  - 'Cesium ion uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header
    with the format Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>. The API supports both
    public scopes (assets:limited-list, assets:read, geocode) and private scopes (assets:list,
    assets:write, profile:read, tokens:read, tokens:write, archives:read, archives:write,
    exports:read, exports:write) to control access permissions. For user-facing applications,
    the authorizationCode OAuth 2.0 flow is supported with required PKCE authentication.'
  - Cesium ion uses OAuth2 authentication with the `tokens:write` scope required to
    create new tokens. Tokens are returned as JWT strings and used for making subsequent
    ion API requests.
  - OAuth2 authentication is required for all archive operations. Use the OAuth2 token
    in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Required scopes are archives:read
    for read operations (download, list) and archives:write for write operations (delete).
    A 401 Invalid Credentials response indicates authentication failure.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://cesium.com/learn/ion/rest-api/:
  - Pagination uses RFC 5988 Link header with rel="next" and rel="prev" relations
    pointing to next and previous pages. Stop paginating when the Link header contains
    no next relation or is absent. Treat all link URLs as opaque and use them directly
    for subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses RFC 5988 Link headers with next and prev relations. Request the
    next page using the URL from the Link header's next relation; stop when no next
    relation is present.
