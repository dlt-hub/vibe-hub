auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.flow.com/blockchain-development-tutorials/tokens/fungible-token-cadence:
  - Authorization for the `withdraw()` function requires an entitled reference with
    the `FungibleToken.Withdraw` entitlement, which must be explicitly granted by
    the owner. The reference syntax is `<auth(FungibleToken.Withdraw) &{FungibleToken.Vault}>`,
    and without this authorization, third parties cannot access the privileged withdraw
    functionality on resource objects.
