auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/2.12.0/data-sources/restapi/:
  - 'REST API supports four authentication types: None, Basic (username and password),
    Bearer (JWT token), and OAuth 2.0 (requires access token URL, client ID, client
    secret, scopes, authorization URL, and custom authentication parameters). Credentials
    are sent via headers or as part of the OAuth 2.0 flow configuration.'
- information_source; https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/2.23.0/data-sources/restapi/:
  - Bearer Token authentication is supported for REST API requests in ToolJet. Configure
    the data source by entering the Base URL, optional Headers as key-value pairs,
    and selecting Bearer Token as the Authentication type. The bearer token is then
    sent in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>" for accessing
    protected resources.
  - Bearer token authentication is used to access protected REST API resources. Select
    Bearer as the authentication type and enter the security token issued by the authentication
    server in the Token field. The token will be sent in the Authorization header
    with each request. Optionally, configure SSL certificates (CA Certificate or Client
    Certificate with client.key, client.crt, and server.crt files) for server verification
    and mutual authentication.
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. The authorization flow uses Client ID and
    Client secret credentials obtained from Google Cloud Console. Redirect URIs must
    be configured as either https://app.tooljet.com/oauth2/authorize for cloud or
    http://localhost:8082/oauth2/authorize for local deployment. The Grant Type field
    is available with default values. Scopes include profile and email. The Base URL
    for Google's OAuth 2.0 API is https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo.
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication using Authorization Code grant type. Send access token
    in Authorization header with Bearer prefix. Required parameters: Access Token
    URL (https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token), Authorization URL (https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth),
    Client ID, Client Secret, and Scope (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile).
    Custom parameters needed: response_type set to "code", client_id, and redirect_uri
    (http://localhost:8080).'
