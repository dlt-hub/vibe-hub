- Avoid symlinking the harperdb directory to itself

- clustering.republishMessages now defaults to false.
- HarperDB now runs natively on Windows 10 and 11 without the need to run in a container
  or installed in WSL. Windows is only intended for evaluation and development purposes,
  not for production work loads.
- This is documentation for Harper Docs 4.4, which is no longer actively maintained.
- This is documentation for Harper Docs 4.1, which is no longer actively maintained.
- The http element has been expanded.
- threads has moved out of the http element and now is its own top level element.
- authentication section was moved out of the operationsApi section and is now its
  own top level element/section.
- analytics.aggregatePeriod was added.
- operationsApi.foreground was removed.
- Made operationsApi configuration optional.
- Added a securePort parameter to operationsApi and http used for setting the https
  port.
- Added a new top level tls section.
- Removed customFunctions.enabled, customFunctions.network.https, operationsApi.network.https
  and operationsApi.nodeEnv.
- Added an element called componentRoot which replaces customFunctions.root.
- Updated custom pathing to use databases instead of schemas.
- Added logging.auditAuthEvents.logFailed and logging.auditAuthEvents.logSuccessful
  for enabling logging of auth events.
- A new mqtt section was added.
- Best-practice to define schemas for tables to ensure predictable, consistent structures
  with data integrity.
- Individual attributes are reflexively created as data is ingested.
- 'Get started by setting `graphql: true` in `config.yaml`.'
- Harper's GraphQL component is inspired by the GraphQL Over HTTP specification; however,
  it does not fully implement neither that specification nor the GraphQL specification.
- The Harper GraphQL querying system is strictly limited to exported Harper Resources.
- Harper databases hold a collection of tables together in a single file that are
  transactionally connected.
- With dynamic schemas individual attributes are reflexively created as data is ingested.
- Harper database metadata (database names, table names, and attribute/column names)
  are case sensitive.
- Spaces are allowed, but not recommended as best practice.
- If you want to act upon a table or resource, querying or writing to it, then use
  the static methods to initially access or write data.
- If you want to define custom behavior for a table or resource, then extend the class
  and override/define instance methods.
- Indexes have been automatically created for `dog_name` and `owner_name` attributes.
- This document applies to self-hosted Harper instances only.
- Harper can be upgraded using a combination of npm and built-in Harper upgrade scripts.
- Harper configuration settings can be passed as Docker run environment variables.
- If no environment variables are provided, Harper will operate with default configuration
  settings.
- 'Get started by setting graphql: true in config.yaml.'
- Queries can either be GET or POST requests.
- GraphQL component is inspired by the GraphQL Over HTTP specification; however, it
  does not fully implement neither that specification nor the GraphQL specification.
- The querying system loosely supports fragments.
- Endpoints created with Harper automatically support Basic, Cookie, and JWT authentication
  methods
- Harper supports heterogeneous records
- Harper does not currently include any built-in applications, making 'custom applications'
  a bit redundant.
- Requests need to be authenticated with basic auth or JWT authentication
- Harper supports MQTT over standard TCP sockets or over WebSockets.
- mTLS is also supported by enabling it in the configuration.
- It is recommended that you use the latest version (V2) of the Resource API with
  the legacy instance binding behavior disabled.
- By default, Harper will replicate all the data in all the databases.
- You can configure which databases are replicated, and then override this behavior
  on a per-table basis.
- CBOR is generally the most efficient and powerful encoding format, with the best
  performance, most compact encoding, and most expansive ability to encode different
  data types like Dates, Maps, and Sets.
- You may need to go to your harper directory and set it up as a link first
- Clone node does not require any additional configuration apart from the variables
  referenced above.
- Clone will only run once, when you first start the container.
- Some of the storage configuration (such as compression) cannot be updated on existing
  databases, this is where the following options are useful.
- Whenever upgrading your Harper installation it is recommended you make a backup
  of your data first.
- By default, Harper automatically authorizes all requests from loopback IP addresses
  as the superuser.
- Endpoints created with Harper automatically support Basic, Cookie, and JWT authentication
  methods.
- As of Harper v4.6, a new, experimental component system has been introduced called
  plugins.
- Requests need to be authenticated with basic auth or JWT authentication.
- Harper provides real-time access to data and messaging.
- Harper supports multiple standardized protocols to facilitate diverse standards-based
  client interaction.
- Harper’s replication system is designed to make distributed data replication fast
  and reliable across multiple nodes.
- Harper encourages developers to utilize other querying tools over SQL for performance
  purposes.
- The SQL parser is still actively being developed, many SQL features may not be optimized
  or utilize indexes.
- Some of the storage configuration (such as compression) cannot be updated on existing
  databases, this is where the following options are useful. They will create a new
  compressed copy of the database with any updated configuration.
- HarperDB must be restarted for changes to take effect.
- The CLI can also be used to run operations on remote Harper instances.
