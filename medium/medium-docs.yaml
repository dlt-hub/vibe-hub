notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- There is a bug in handling query parameters that may already be causing considerable
  problems and many aren’t aware of it.
- This behavior isn’t always the same for query parameters.
- Lenient handling is the behavior discussed here. Invalid query parameters are ignored,
  the call only processes the valid parameters, and no error or warning of any type
  is returned.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '400 Bad Request: Invalid request body parameters.'
- '404: Resource not found.'
- '200 OK: Successful call even with invalid query parameters.'
