# Overview

This document provides a configuration example for integrating with a third-party webcomic API using dltHub's REST API source format. The integration allows for the retrieval of comic data from a specified API endpoint. The configuration is designed to be vendor-neutral and does not include any proprietary or branded content.

## Configuration Example

```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import rest_api_source

source = rest_api_source({
    "client": {
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
        "auth": {
            "type": "none"
        }
    },
    "resource_defaults": {
        "primary_key": "id",
        "write_disposition": "merge"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "comic_data",
            "endpoint": {
                "path": "/v1/comic",
                "data_selector": "data",
                "paginator": {
                    "type": "single_page"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

## Authentication

- Type: None
- This API does not require authentication for accessing the comic data.

## Resources

- **Resource Name**: comic_data
- **Endpoint Path**: `/v1/comic`
- **HTTP Method**: GET (default)
- **Pagination Strategy**: single_page
- **Data Selector**: `data`

## Error Handling

- The configuration does not specify any error handling logic. It is recommended to implement retry logic for common HTTP status codes such as 429 (Too Many Requests) and 5xx (Server Errors) if needed.

## Schema

- The schema for the comic data is not explicitly defined in the YAML configuration. It is recommended to define fields, types, and nullability based on the API's response structure. Use neutral field names such as `comic_id`, `title`, `image_url`, etc.

This configuration provides a basic setup for accessing comic data from a third-party API using dltHub's REST API source. Adjust the parameters as needed to fit the specific requirements of the API you are integrating with.
