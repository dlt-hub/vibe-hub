# Overview

This document provides a configuration guide for integrating with a generic RSS API using dltHub's REST API source. The integration allows for the extraction and synchronization of data from an RSS feed, supporting a variety of sync types as defined by the API's capabilities.

# Configuration Example

```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import rest_api_source

source = rest_api_source({
    "client": {
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
        "auth": {
            "type": "none"  # No authentication required for public RSS feeds
        }
    },
    "resource_defaults": {
        "primary_key": "id",
        "write_disposition": "merge"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "rss_feed",
            "endpoint": {
                "path": "/v1/rss",
                "data_selector": "items",
                "paginator": {
                    "type": "single_page"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

# Authentication

- **Type**: None
- This configuration assumes the RSS feed is publicly accessible and does not require authentication. If authentication is needed, adjust the `auth` section accordingly.

# Resources

- **Resource Name**: rss_feed
- **Endpoint Path**: `/v1/rss`
- **HTTP Method**: GET (default)
- **Pagination Strategy**: single_page (no pagination required for RSS feeds)
- **Data Selector**: `items` (assumes the RSS feed data is contained within an "items" field)

# Error Handling

- **Retry/Backoff Logic**: Not specified, but can be added if the API has rate limits or intermittent availability issues.
- **Known HTTP Response Codes**: Standard HTTP error handling can be implemented as needed.

# Schema

- **Fields**: The schema should be defined based on the structure of the RSS feed. Use neutral field names such as `title`, `link`, `description`, `pub_date`, etc.
- **Types and Nullability**: Define field types and nullability based on the RSS feed's data structure.

This configuration provides a basic setup for integrating with an RSS feed using dltHub's REST API source. Adjust the parameters as needed to fit the specific requirements and structure of the RSS feed you are working with.
