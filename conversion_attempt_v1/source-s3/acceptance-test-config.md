The provided YAML configuration appears to be a set of test cases for a data integration tool, likely related to a specific vendor's product. The task is to convert this into a vendor-neutral dltHub-compatible REST API source documentation. However, the YAML does not contain direct API configuration details such as base URLs, authentication methods, or endpoint paths, which are typically required for such a conversion. Instead, it focuses on test configurations and expected outcomes.

Given the constraints and the nature of the input, I'll provide a generalized example of how a REST API source configuration might look in dltHub's format, based on typical patterns and structures. This example will be hypothetical and not directly derived from the YAML, as the YAML lacks the necessary API configuration details.

# Overview

This document provides a configuration example for integrating with a generic third-party analytics API using dltHub's REST API source. The integration supports various data formats and includes error handling and pagination strategies.

## Configuration Example

```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import rest_api_source

source = rest_api_source({
    "client": {
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
        "auth": {
            "type": "api_key",
            "name": "api_key",
            "api_key": dlt.secrets["api_key"],
            "location": "query"
        }
    },
    "resource_defaults": {
        "primary_key": "id",
        "write_disposition": "merge"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "resource_name",
            "endpoint": {
                "path": "/v1/resource",
                "data_selector": "data",
                "paginator": {
                    "type": "offset",
                    "limit": 100
                }
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

## Authentication

- **Type**: API Key
- **Secrets**: Use `dlt.secrets["api_key"]` to securely store and access your API key.
- **Location**: The API key is included in the query parameters of each request.

## Resources

- **Resource Name**: `resource_name`
- **Endpoint Path**: `/v1/resource`
- **HTTP Method**: GET (default)
- **Pagination Strategy**: Offset-based pagination with a limit of 100 records per request.
- **Data Selector**: The data is extracted from the `data` field in the API response.

## Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: The integration will retry requests on HTTP status codes 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504.
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts will be made before failing.
- **Backoff Factor**: A backoff factor of 2 is used to space out retries.

## Schema

- **Fields**: The schema is defined based on the API's response structure, using neutral field names such as `customer_id` and `event_timestamp`.
- **Types**: Field types are inferred from the API response, with support for common data types like strings, integers, and timestamps.
- **Nullability**: Fields may be nullable depending on the API's data model.

```

### Notes:
- The example above is a generic template and does not directly map to the provided YAML, as the YAML lacks specific API configuration details.
- The configuration assumes a typical REST API integration pattern with dltHub, including authentication, resource configuration, and error handling.
- The actual implementation would require specific details about the API being integrated, such as the base URL, authentication method, and endpoint paths.
