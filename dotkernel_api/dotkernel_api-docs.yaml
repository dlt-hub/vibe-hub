auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.dotkernel.org/api-documentation/v5/core-features/authentication/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with JWT bearer tokens. Clients must include the access_token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for authenticated requests.
    Tokens expire after 86400 seconds and can be refreshed by sending a POST request
    to /security/refresh-token with grant_type "refresh_token", client_id "frontend",
    client_secret "frontend", scope "api", and the refresh_token value in the request
    body. The server returns a new access_token and refresh_token in the response.
  - Token generation uses OAuth2 password grant type. Send a POST request to `/security/generate-token`
    with JSON body containing grant_type set to "password", client_id and client_secret
    from the oauth_clients table, scope set to "api", username (identity field) and
    password from the admin or user table. The response includes a token_type of "Bearer"
    and an access token that should be sent in subsequent requests as an Authorization
    header with Bearer prefix.
