notes:
- Ensure your Google Maps JavaScript API key is correctly loaded and configured in
  your BetterForms application for this component to function.
- Multi-Mode Authentication System includes URL hash and username (email) and password
  authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- A site in BetterForms is the core of your web app.
- It contains many settings that apply to all pages of your app.
- All hooks have a maximum time of 20 Seconds before they error.
- Authentication is enabled on a per-page basis in BetterForms
- Users must also have the isEnabled field of their user record set to True before
  they can login
- BetterForms is built with Bootstrap CSS as the UI design framework.
- For full installation and configuration details, see BF Enterprise Documentation
- This is a work in progress
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Setup of connected app is required for authentication
- Performance optimization may be necessary based on payload size.
- The model property is crucial and must map to a field in your BetterForms data model
  designed to store a boolean value.
- For scenarios requiring a user to select multiple items from a list of checkboxes,
  consider using the checklist element instead.
- The value stored in the model is typically an ISO 8601 formatted string.
- Properly configuring valueZone (for storage) and zone (for display) is important
  for handling timezones correctly, especially if your users or data span multiple
  timezones.
- This element is for displaying images. For image upload functionality, refer to
  BetterForms' uploader components (e.g., Dropzone, Uppy) which are documented separately
  under 'Uploading Files'.
- The model property should provide a valid image source (URL or Base64 data URI).
- Dynamic image display can be achieved by updating the model field through actions
  or hook scripts.
- The inputType property is critical for defining the behavior and validation of the
  input field.
- Always ensure the model property correctly maps to an appropriate field in your
  BetterForms data model.
- The actual value stored in the model might be the raw input or the masked input
  depending on the underlying library's behavior and any pipe function used. Test
  to confirm.
- Complex masking or dynamic masks might require defining the mask as a function.
- This element is excellent for improving data entry accuracy for fixed-format fields.
- The model will store a single number if one handle is used, or an array of two numbers
  if two handles (a range) are used.
- For advanced tooltip formatting or value formatting (like adding currency symbols
  or units), you'll typically use the tooltips (with formatters) or format options
  within noUiSliderOptions.
- The model property will store the value of the selected radio button option.
- Ensure the values array is properly defined to present all necessary choices to
  the user.
- For a large number of single-choice options, a select (dropdown) element might offer
  a more compact UI.
- The model will store the id (or value) of the chosen option from the values array.
- The values array is key. For simple lists, an array of strings can suffice. For
  more control over display text vs. stored value, use an array of objects (commonly
  with id/value and name keys).
- For very long lists of options that might benefit from searching or type-ahead functionality,
  consider more advanced select components like vueMultiSelect (an optional VFG field)
  or custom solutions if available in BetterForms.
- The values array in the main schema provides the source for options. You often reference
  this in selectOptions.options using a path like "self.schema.values" or by directly
  providing an array if the structure is different.
- When options in selectOptions are objects (which is common), trackBy is essential
  to uniquely identify options, and label specifies which object property to display.
- The value stored in the model will be a single selected option object (or its trackBy
  value, depending on configuration) for single select, or an array of selected option
  objects (or their trackBy values) for multi-select.
- Ensure vue-multiselect is integrated into your BetterForms environment for this
  component to function.
- Currently modules will need a CDN link and must install themselves.
- Module libraries must be available via a CDN
- Modules must self install as a global Vue component
- Modules must not require initialization code and be ready for use as a Vue component
- Modules that are not Vue components can still be used but will often require writing
  small JS interface code to help patch them into the BF framework.
