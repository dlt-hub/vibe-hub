  - 'Request signing using HMAC-SHA256 with three required headers. Construct a signature
    string from the lowercased HTTP method and path (request-target), Date header,
    and Digest header (SHA-256 of request body in base64). Sign this string with your
    organization''s API secret using HMAC-SHA256, base64-encode the result, and send
    in the Authorization header with format: Signature keyId="your-api-key",algorithm="hmac-sha256",headers="(request-target)
    date digest",signature="your-signature". Also include Date header (RFC format)
    and Digest header (SHA-256=base64-encoded-body-hash).'

  - HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication using HTTP Signature scheme. Construct
    a signing string from request method (lowercase), URI path, Date header, and Digest
    header (SHA-256 of body), then compute Base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 digest using
    an api_secret key. Include the signature in the Authorization header following
    HTTP Signature specification with headers parameter listing "(request-target)
    date digest".
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://cognitohq.com/docs/reference:
  - Pagination uses link-based navigation with next and previous fields in the response
    links object, both of which are nullable strings containing HTTP/HTTPS URLs to
    the next or previous page of results respectively.
  - The API uses link-based pagination with a `next` field in the `links` object of
    the response. To paginate, use the URL provided in the `next` field to fetch the
    subsequent page of results. A `previous` field is also available for navigating
    backwards. Pagination continues until `next` is null.
  - The API uses link-based pagination with next and previous fields in a links object
    within the response. The next field contains a URL to the next page of results
    if one exists, and previous contains a URL to the previous page if not on the
    first page. Construct subsequent requests by using the URL from the next field
    until it returns null, indicating the last page.
  - The response includes pagination via a "links" object containing "previous" and
    "next" fields with full URLs to navigate between pages. Use the URL in the "next"
    field to fetch the next page of results, and the "previous" field for the prior
    page.
