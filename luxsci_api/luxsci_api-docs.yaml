auth_info:
- information_source; https://luxsci.com/luxsci-enhances-api-authentication/:
  - 'LuxSci API supports three authentication methods: OAuth 2.0, API Key, and Basic
    authentication. The documentation also mentions enhanced multi-factor authentication
    (MFA) protection with one-time-use codes and a proprietary LuxSci Secure option,
    though specific details on header names, parameter names, token endpoints, scopes,
    or implementation details are not provided in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://luxsci.com/rest-api/endpoint-documentation.html:
  - 'Access control required to execute this endpoint: Account: Users - Enable/Disable/Delete


    This indicates role-based access control is needed. The endpoint requires specific
    permissions tied to the "Account: Users - Enable/Disable/Delete" role or capability.
    Credentials must be authenticated to the account before calling this endpoint,
    and the authenticated user must have the Account Users management permission enabled.'
  - 'Access control required to execute this endpoint: User Email - Sending. The endpoint
    requires authentication tied to a user email account with sending permissions,
    indicated by the path parameter username and the access control note specifying
    "User Email - Sending" authorization.'
  - 'Access control required to execute this endpoint: User Settings - Change Password'
  - 'Access control required to execute this endpoint: User Settings - Change Password.
    App-specific passwords are used as login credentials; the endpoint requires a
    username path parameter and suffix path parameter to retrieve app-specific password
    definitions, which contain suffix, title, types (comma-delimited access codes),
    created timestamp, and expires timestamp.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://luxsci.com/rest-api/endpoint-documentation.html:
  - 'Pagination is controlled via two optional query parameters: limit_start (integer,
    starting row) and limit_count (integer, number of records). The response contains
    data as an array but does not indicate next/previous page information or total
    counts, so you must track position using limit_start and limit_count values across
    requests.'
