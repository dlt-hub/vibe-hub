notes:
- 'agent contains inappropriate content: Racist, Violence, Religion related, Political
  content, and underage NSFW are strictly prohibited'
- Only the pure text part will be used as the knowledge base content. Multimedia content
  such as files, online links, images, and audio attached to the page cannot be read
  at present.
- Import natural language text paragraphs as much as possible and avoid complex formatted
  content such as tables.
- Creating a tg agent will synchronize with your agent on MyShell, and your prompt
  modifications will be reflected on the tg agent in real-time without any additional
  operation from you.
- The bound agent will not have the cover picture of the agent on MyShell.
- If the name of the agent is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized on
  TG, but if it is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the name of the first
  modification will be synchronized.
- After the updated agent can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG agent
  will prioritize calling the public agent.
- Some agents may have specific integration requirements.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of API credentials in MyShell
- You need a Creator Pass to publish at most three agents for anyone to use.
- Visit the ComfyUI homepage to download and install ComfyUI.
- User Inputs in a single State should be either all form inputs or all IM inputs.
- The initial state’s Input will be ignored during the first run.
- You need to have your own OpenAI API Key.
- This API Key will only be used for building purposes in your local open-sourced
  project.
- Activate the ability to set up paid features by toggling the Monetization switch
  to ON.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in MyShell
- $SHELL is the native token powering the MyShell ecosystem, granting access to premium
  features, enabling creator support, and facilitating payments.
- The total supply of $SHELL is capped at 1,000,000,000 tokens, which will be gradually
  released over time to cultivate a deflationary economy and maintain token scarcity.
- Fast enough for CPU real-time inference.
