notes:
- Data includes various types of network tests such as speed tests, voice tests, and
  more.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The Wyebot DEX sensor is a plug-and-play solution that requires no configuration
  in order to get started.
- Wyebot supports IdP initiated SAML.
- The sensor captures WiFi traffic that is visible on both the 2.4 and 5GHz frequency
  spectrums.
- The sensor does not decrypt wireless traffic from 802.1x or Pre-shared key (PSK)
  encrypted networks.
- Data is accessible on the Wyebot dashboard for 30 days.
- Wyebot does not sell or share its data with other parties.
- Plug-and-play solution that requires no configuration.
- Wyebot supports SSO integration via the SAML authentication standard.
- Wyebot WIP™ works alongside existing WLAN equipment.
- No monthly recurring costs for Wyebot WIP™.
- The Wyebot sensor needs wireless credentials for any SSID that network tests will
  be run against.
- All communication between the sensor and the Wyebot cloud servers is transmitted
  via a TLS-encrypted secure MQTT tunnel.
- By default, a sensor is a completely passive device. It only captures data; it does
  not transmit any wireless data.
- Only the 802.11 header of wireless packets is sent to the cloud for analysis - payload
  data (including websites, protocols and application data) is not sent to the cloud.
- The system does NOT decrypt encrypted wireless traffic.
- All SAML users are treated as Administrators on the Wyebot dashboard.
- Limited users are currently not supported for SAML authentication.
- The HAR file will contain sensitive information such as the username and password
  used to login. It is recommended to create a separate user account for use by the
  sensor so personal information is not captured.
- Unless otherwise assigned, all sensors will use the Basic Wired Profile - which
  will have the wired traffic use the native/untagged VLAN with no 802.1X authentication.
- The Basic Wired Profile cannot be deleted.
- To receive any configuration, the sensors must first be online and communicating
  with the Wyebot cloud servers.
- Sensors must be initially connected on an open port (no authentication) to receive
  Wired Port Profile configuration.
- Enabling a Wired Port Profile with 802.1X authentication will NOT break the connection
  on the open port.
- Ensure time synchronization on all servers involved.
- API key is required for access.
- Metrics available for network tests, sensor, access point, client, RF analytics.
- The pass/fail status is represented as an integer within the result_status_id field.
- The pass/fail status will be represented as an integer within the result_status_id
  field.
errors:
- '400: Bad Request'
- '401: Unauthorized'
- '404: Not Found'
- '429: Too Many Requests'
- '500: Internal Server Error'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- The sensor does not have a config file and is attempting to retrieve one from the
  cloud.
- The sensor cannot communicate with the cloud servers, it is usually because the
  traffic is being blocked by a firewall.
- The most common issue encountered is if the web browser opens the captive portal
  authentication page in either a new tab or a new window from the original tab.
