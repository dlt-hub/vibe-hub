In this guide, we'll set up a complete Salesflare data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def salesflare_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.salesflare.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "apikey",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "tasks",
            "accounts",
            "contacts"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='salesflare_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='salesflare_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(salesflare_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from salesflare‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Tasks: Manage and retrieve tasks associated with accounts.
- Accounts: Access and manage customer accounts information.
- Contacts: Handle contacts details associated with accounts.
- Opportunities: Manage sales opportunities and related data.
- Workflows: Access and manage automated workflows.
- Tags: Manage tags for organizing data across different modules.
- Persons: Manage individual person records linked to accounts.
- Email Data Sources: Manage email data sources for integrating emailing capabilities.
- Custom Field Types: Access custom field definitions used within the system.
- Pipelines: Manage sales pipelines to track progress of opportunities.
- Users: Access user information within the system.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Salesflare workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@salesflare-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Salesflare support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:salesflare duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Salesflare API, as specified in @salesflare-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "tasks" and "accounts" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in salesflare_pipeline.py and name the pipeline salesflare_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python salesflare_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is handled by an API Key, which needs to be included in the request headers under the key 'Authorization'.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.salesflare.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python salesflare_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline salesflare load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset salesflare_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/salesflare.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline salesflare_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("salesflare_pipeline").dataset()
   # get tasks table as Pandas frame
   data.tasks.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure the API key is valid to avoid 401 Unauthorized errors. Pagination is managed automatically by the system, which may need considerations when handling large data sets.
