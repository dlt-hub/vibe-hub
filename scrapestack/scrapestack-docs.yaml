auth_info:
- information_source; https://scrapestack.com/documentation:
  - Authentication is performed by passing your unique API access key as a GET parameter
    named `access_key` to the base endpoint `https://api.scrapestack.com/scrape`.
    The access key is required for every request and can be found in your account
    dashboard.
  - The API requires an access key sent as a GET parameter. Users must supply a valid
    access key with each request; missing or invalid keys return error code 101. The
    access key is required for all API functions and must be included in the request
    parameters.
  - The API uses query parameter-based authentication. Include the access_key parameter
    in the request URL with your API key value. The access_key must be passed as a
    query parameter named access_key to authenticate requests to the scrapestack API
    endpoint.
  - The scrapestack API uses an access key for authentication. The access key must
    be passed as a query parameter named access_key in the request URL to the scrapestack
    API endpoint at https://api.scrapestack.com/scrape. You need to sign up for API
    access to obtain an access_key value, which is then included in all requests as
    access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY in the query string.
  - The scrapestack API uses an access key for authentication. The access key must
    be passed as the `access_key` HTTP GET parameter in all API requests to the scrapestack
    endpoint. You can obtain an API access key by signing up for API access through
    their pricing page.
  - The scrapestack API uses query parameter-based API key authentication. Attach
    the `access_key` parameter to the API base URL and set it to your unique API access
    key obtained from your account dashboard. All connections support 256-bit HTTPS
    encryption by using the https protocol.
