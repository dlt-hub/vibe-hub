notes:
- The Power BI API has some limitations, including an hourly limit of 1,000,000 rows
  per dataset.
- MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) is not supported.
- The server browser interface is protected by a username and password.
- User and password credentials are the only supported form of authentication for
  the JDBC connection, regardless of the type(s) of authentication supported in the
  source / target system of the connection.
- The JDBC connection only allows read access (extract types Relational and RelationalTable)
  and usage in load type RelationalSQL. "Relational" type loads are not allowed.
- The connection refers to the name of the Jedox connection in the Jedox Integrator
  project.
- New fresh System DB is created when System database.csv file is missing.
- Organizational account and other options are not supported at this time, but may
  appear in a future update of the OData Service.
