auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.moxion.io/article/234-api-documentation:
  - Authenticate against the API using the /authenticate/api endpoint to obtain a
    security token, which must then be included in subsequent API calls for authorization.
    The exact mechanism for sending credentials to /authenticate/api and the format
    of the returned token are not specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - The user is authenticated via an immediates connection, which is created by calling
    /create/connection/immediates. When authenticated this way, the project_id is
    extracted from the auth token and does not need to be provided as a request parameter.
    In all other usages, the project_id must be specified as a request parameter.
  - 'Token Required: Yes


    The API requires a token for authentication. The documentation does not specify
    the exact header name, parameter name, or token type (bearer token, API key, etc.),
    so the precise mechanism for passing this token cannot be determined from the
    provided text.'
  - Token-based authentication is required for these endpoints. The token must be
    provided to access the download assets information and direct download functionality,
    though the documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter name,
    or token format for sending the token in requests.
- information_source; https://help.moxion.io/collection/227-api-documentation:
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Call the /authenticate/api endpoint with
    credentials to obtain a security token, then include this token in subsequent
    API requests for authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.moxion.io/category/248-api-index:
  - Pagination uses optional limit and offset parameters. limit specifies the maximum
    number of events returned (valid integer), and offset specifies where to start
    in the result set (valid integer). Continue paginating by incrementing offset
    by the limit value until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - The /get/destination/messages endpoint uses limit (optional, defaults to 10) as
    a query parameter to control the number of messages per request, and start_after_message_id
    (optional) to specify where to begin retrieval for pagination. The response includes
    message id values that should be used as start_after_message_id in subsequent
    requests to retrieve the next set of messages.
