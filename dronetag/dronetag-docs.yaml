auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.dronetag.cz/cs/developers/data-pull/getting-started-sio:
  - Bearer token authentication is required for WebSocket connections. Send the access
    token in the `Authorization` header of the handshake request using the format
    `Bearer <token>`. The header must be included in the `extraHeaders` option when
    establishing the Socket.IO connection to the Dronetag API endpoint.
  - Socket.io session authentication uses an access token obtained from the REST API
    credentials. The token can be passed via the native Socket.io `auth` configuration
    option as a string value, or alternatively as a Bearer token in the handshake
    request headers. The exact method depends on your Socket.io client library's capabilities.
  - The authentication is passed via the Socket.io connection options in the auth
    field. Credentials should be provided as an object in the auth parameter when
    establishing the connection to the Socket.io endpoint at https://api.dronetag.app
    with path /v2/airspace/socket.io, though the specific auth scheme and required
    fields are not detailed in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://help.dronetag.cz/developers/data-pull/authenticating:
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Access tokens
    are issued as JWTs and are short-lived, requiring refresh upon expiration. Personal
    Access Tokens (PATs) are also supported as an authentication method.


    Authorization: Bearer <JWT_token>'
  - Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are created via POST to /v2/pats/tokens after authenticating
    through OpenID Connect flow, with a JSON body containing password and optional
    expires_at fields. Once created, use the token in the X-Personal-Access HTTP header
    for subsequent API requests. PATs only work for HTTP requests, not WebSockets.
