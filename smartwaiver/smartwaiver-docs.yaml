  paginator: Pagination is required and uses a zero-based index, so to query all results
    start with ?page=0; the supported methods of pagination include using `limit`
    and `offset`, where `limit` is required with a default value of 20 and allowed
    values between 1 and 300, and `offset` is optional for how many pages to paginate
    through.
