    (default 10) controls page size, and offset controls the starting position. Response
    includes total count, prev and next URLs with constructed offset values for navigation.
    Stop paginating when next is null.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes a pagination
    object with offset, limit, total count, and prev/next URLs for navigation. Use
    the next or prev URLs to fetch subsequent or previous pages, or construct requests
    with new offset values (incrementing by limit for next page, decrementing for
    previous).

    object with offset, limit, total count, and prev/next URLs. Use the next URL to

  - Resource collection endpoints are paginated to 20 items by default. Pagination
    data is returned in a pagination property containing offset (int), limit (int),
    total (int), prev (string URL to previous page), and next (string URL to next
    page). Use the next and prev URLs directly to navigate pages.
