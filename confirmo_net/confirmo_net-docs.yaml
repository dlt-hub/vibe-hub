auth_info:
- information_source; https://confirmonetapi.docs.apiary.io/:
  - A callback password is an autogenerated alphanumeric string used to validate webhook
    requests. For each HTTP notification, the system generates a signature by concatenating
    the request/response body with the callback password, hashing with SHA256, and
    including the hexadecimal result in the `bp-signature` request header. Validate
    incoming webhooks by reproducing this signature calculation and comparing it to
    the header value.
  - 'Each request must include an Authorization header with a Bearer token containing
    a valid API key. The header format is "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}".
    A 401 Unauthorized status code is returned if the API key is invalid or missing
    from the request header.'
