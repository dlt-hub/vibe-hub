notes:
- A technical understanding of APIs and how they work is required to use the provided
  API endpoints.
- You must have an active AccuLynx account and have created and named an API Key for
  authentication.
- Endpoints should be quick and stable.
- Respond promptly with a success status code (from 200).
- The timeout limit for webhooks is 10 seconds.
- Be prepared to handle duplicate events.
- Minimize response headers and body content.
- Webhooks require careful attention to security to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Developers must register the webhook endpoint to create a subscription.
- In order to use the AccuLynx API, you must have an active AccuLynx account and have
  acquired an API Key.
- All API requests require authentication via an API Key.
- Each integration within an AccuLynx account location should have its own API Key.
- Create a different key per Zap to allow reporting within AccuLynx on each.
- Location or Company Administrator permissions are required.
- An API Key must be sent with every request.
- Each individual location within a company needs its own API key.
- An AccuLynx account with administrative privileges is required.
- The AccuLynx API employs proactive measures to manage excessive usage. Please design
  your integration calls to stay within this rate limit.
- Every application is subject to an IP-based concurrent request limit of 30 requests
  per second. If a single IP is making more than 30 requests per second, new requests
  will be denied and return an HTTP 429 status code.
- After that, if an application does have a valid API key, we limit requests to 10
  requests per second by that key.
errors:
- 'HTTP 429: New requests will be denied due to exceeding the rate limit.'
