notes:
- 'The secondary source can be `aux` or `external`, any other value will assign the
  property to null (ie: off)'
- Ontime is a browser-based application that manages rundowns, scheduling, and cueing.
- It supports live productions, broadcasts, and events with real-time collaboration
  and powerful integrations.
- Ontime is made by entertainment technicians and video engineers and distributed
  for free.
- Ontime will remain a free, open-source app with no hidden features behind paying
  tiers.
- With the Ontime Cloud PRO subscription, you are currently allowed to manage three
  concurrent stages.
- The stage does not update automatically. If you need to use a newer version of Ontime,
  you must close and restart the stage.
- Ontime Cloud supports the same HTTP and WebSocket API as Ontime
- Ontime uses TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) to manage logins.
- This provides a safe and convenient method for authentication, especially in accounts
  shared across multiple users.
- The Editor view is the main application view.
- The Cuesheet is a view designed for real-time, cross-department collaboration.
- The documentation here will likely become out of sync as we add more features to
  Ontime.
- You must leverage Javascript, CSS and HTML for deployment using Ontime’s infrastructure.
- Ontime exposes any file inside its external folder to the network.
- Ontime reads a single worksheet
- You can have as many columns as necessary, Ontime only imports the columns you request
- 'Field names are not case-sensitive: both Title and title would be recognised on
  import'
- To use the Google Sheet integration, you will a Google account and to the Google
  Console.
- The machine running Ontime must have access to the internet.
- URL presets are user defined aliases (shortcuts) to Ontime URLs.
- The configuration for URL Presets is done centrally from the Editor settings at
  Editor -> Sharing and reporting -> URL Presets.
- All times are in milliseconds.
- The entire Runtime Data object is available in integrations using the above templates.
- All HTTP requests are GET requests.
- The OSC and WebSocket APIs allow for low latency communication to Ontime server.
- Most views are configurable using URL parameters.
- The only exceptions are the editor and cuesheet views.
- You can leverage the countdown view to have a screen that counts down to selection
  of events in the rundown.
- Ontime does not have built-in overrides for custom background images.
- You can leverage CSS overrides to achieve a custom background image.
- Ontime serves its web pages on port 4001.
- Docker containers default to UTC timezone, which you can modify using the TZ environment
  variable.
- Your data is yours to keep and manage.
- You can easily transfer data between Ontime running in your machine and our Cloud
  service.
- For users running Ontime from a password protected stage in Ontime Cloud, you will
  need to create a link that contains authentication.
- Keep in mind that these rules will also affect template variables.
- Ontime provides a few fail-safes to protect its runtime.
- If the app detects that it has been shutdown unexpectedly, Ontime will recover the
  state on the next start.
- When Ontime loads a project it ensures that its data is correct.
- Ontime discourages you from exposing the application in a public network.
- The most significant security control should happen at the network access level.
- The API’s provided by Ontime are ideal for software-to-software communication.
- Custom fields allow adding your data to any event in the rundown.
- Cuesheet is designed for real-time, cross-department collaboration.
