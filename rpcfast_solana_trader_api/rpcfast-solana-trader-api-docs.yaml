notes:
- RPC Fast is an enterprise-level blockchain API and node service provider.
- We provide clients with auto-scalable geo-distributed global infrastructure, dedicated
  nodes and HA clusters.
- Pricing starts from $1,800/month in the EU location for 512GB RAM
- No historical/archival data access on dedicated nodes
- No setup fee!
- Both crypto and fiat payments are accepted.
- RPC Fast does not provide a fallback service (such as automated traffic rerouting
  to a healthy node during downtime or scheduled maintenance), as the setup is based
  on a standalone node rather than a high-availability (HA) cluster with a load balancer.
- Mostly used to subscribe for events which are going on Solana network, such as transactions,
  votes, new blocks, program executions, etc.
- gRPC has minimal latency and maximum throughput compared to traditional WebSocket
  subscriptions.
- Using a suggested tip amount does not guarantee your transaction will be included
  in the next block.
- Endpoints are protected with CloudFlare and geographically hosted at OVH in UK,
  London.
- 'Setup timeline: ~5-7 working days after the server is delivered from the data center,
  which normally happens within 72hrs.'
- 'Minimum contract length: 3 months, with the possibility of extension for an additional
  3–12 months.'
- Scheduled maintenance notifications are sent promptly via designated communication
  channel.
- Support hours covered by SLA are Mon-Fri 8:00-19:00 CET.
- Supports multiple transactions through debug_traceCallMulti method.
- ETH Mempool is not available within a free SaaS – only as a solution within a Self-Hosted
  Cluster
- API Key is confidential and should not be shared.
- A Free Plan gives you access to healthy nodes and basic features.
- You won't pay at all for exceeding CU limits on the Free Plan.
- Free plan has 300M CUs available.
- All simulations have a fixed price of 2000 CU.
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is available within the Self-Hosted Cluster of Nodes offering.
- Add JWT to all headers of requests to enable its work.
- If you try sending requests with a wrong JWT or without it after enabling, a program
  will show the error 401 status code.
- No parameters required for eth_accounts method
- The API has a limit of 1000% of the current gas limit for eth_estimateGas and eth_call
  methods to prevent abuse.
- eth_estimateGas doesn’t require gas at all, but with some actions you will need
  to specify it.
- Shows a balance of an account on the chosen address in wei
- Shows a smart contract code, compiled, related to an address you give
- 'Block range > 50K: unavailable'
- 'Block range <= 100: No limitations'
- 'Block range between 100 and 50K: No more than 50K records can be responded'
- Shows the storage- and the account-values of the required account with the Merkle-proof.
- Returns null in case no transaction was found
- Access to information about a transaction after entering a block number and its
  index
- Returns null if the transaction was not finished
- You won’t get transactions of the uncle block by using this method.
- Gives you the quantity of uncles that fit the block number you enter
- Filters can timeout if you don’t recall them via eth_getFilterChanges for a certain
  time
- Shows the true boolean result if the client listens actively for network connections
- No parameters for this method.
- Shows you Keccak-256 (which is not the standard SHA3-256) of the stated data
- MetaMask is a secure cryptocurrency wallet accessible either as a MetaMask app that
  you can run on your desktop and mobile device or as a browser extension.
- Setting up Polygon on MetaMask allows you to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3
- RPC Fast is developed by Dysnix, a Ukrainian team with a legal entity based in Estonia.
- Support hours are Mon-Fri 9:00-18:00 CET.
- 'The support service is off during the public holidays in Ukraine: Independence
  Day of Ukraine (August 24), Christmas & New Year holidays (December 25 – January
  3)'
- Cookies help us to enhance user experience and make this website work better for
  you.
- 'High-availability setup: $200 one-time fee.'
errors:
- '-32600: You have reached CU limit. Please contact RPCFast support, or add fallback=true
  parameter to send the txs through the RPC node on reaching CU limit.'
- HTTPS 429 error with an error code -32005.
- '401 Unauthorized: invalid payload or JWT configuration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or token expiration'
- 'null: No transaction found'
