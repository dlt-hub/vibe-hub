auth_info:
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api:
  - Authentication is achieved via access tokens, cookies or sessions. Specific details
    on header names, parameter names, and implementation methods are not provided
    in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api/authentication:
  - All data in the platform is private by default. Authenticate using POST /auth/login
    with email and password in the request body to obtain an access_token. The access_token
    is then passed to subsequent API requests to access private data. Optionally,
    include otp for multi-factor authentication and mode to specify whether the refresh_token
    is returned in the JSON response or as an httpOnly cookie.
  - The API uses JWT tokens for password reset authentication. The password reset
    endpoint requires a one-time use JWT token passed in the request body under the
    field name "token" to verify the user's identity before allowing them to set a
    new password.
  - The API uses JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens. To refresh an access
    token, send a POST request to `/auth/refresh` with a JSON body containing `refresh_token`
    (the JWT to refresh) and optionally `mode` (either JSON response or httpOnly cookie).
    The response includes a new `access_token`, `expires` timestamp, and optionally
    a new `refresh_token` depending on the mode parameter.
  - The API uses JWT-based authentication. Login via POST /auth/login with email and
    password parameters, receiving an access_token (valid for expires seconds) and
    refresh_token in the response. Include the access_token in subsequent requests,
    typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Use the refresh_token
    to obtain a new access_token when the current one expires.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api/collections:
  - offset is an optional query parameter (integer) that specifies how many items
    to skip when fetching data. The meta query parameter (string) controls what metadata
    to return in the response. No explicit response pagination fields, next page indicators,
    or stopping conditions are documented.
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api/files:
  - Pagination uses limit (integer query parameter controlling number of objects returned)
    and offset (integer query parameter for how many items to skip). Construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the offset value.
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api/items:
  - limit and offset parameters enable pagination. limit (integer) controls the number
    of objects returned per request, and offset (integer) specifies how many items
    to skip. Use offset values incrementally to fetch subsequent pages until the desired
    number of items is retrieved.
- information_source; https://directus.io/docs/api/users:
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters: page (integer, cursor for pagination often
    used with limit), limit (integer, number of objects returned), and offset (integer,
    items to skip). The response includes a meta field for metadata. Construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the page parameter or adjusting offset values.'
  - page is a query parameter used as a cursor for pagination, often used in combination
    with limit to control which page of results to retrieve.
