auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sportalliance.com/apis/magicline/aggregator/aggregator/aggregator-api:
  - API key authentication is required. Include the header X-API-KEY with your API
    key value in all requests to the /v1/aggregators/member endpoint.
- information_source; https://developer.sportalliance.com/apis/perfectgym/openapi/general-information:
  - The PerfectGym Next Open API requires an API key passed as the x-api-key header
    in all requests. Authentication failures return a 401 status code, and permission
    errors return a 403 status code.
  - The PerfectGym Next Open API uses persistent key authentication with a separate
    key per studio. Authentication is performed by sending the API key in the x-api-key
    header with each request. The key is validated server-side to ensure it is valid
    and matches the requesting studio. Upon integration activation, you will receive
    an email containing the OpenAPI studio keys and base URL, and if webhook functionality
    is enabled, two API Keys are provided - one for inbound requests to endpoints
    and one for outbound webhook events.
- information_source; https://developer.sportalliance.com/apis/magicline/openapi/general-information:
  - The API uses an OpenAPI key for authentication. The key must be sent as the `x-api-key`
    header in all requests. A 401 status code indicates authentication failure, typically
    due to a wrong or missing OpenAPI key.
  - 'The Magicline Open API uses persistent key authentication with studio-specific
    keys. Send the API key in the `x-api-key` header with all HTTPS requests. Keys
    are generated automatically per studio and provided via email upon integration
    activation. Two separate API keys are issued: one for inbound requests to endpoints
    and one for outbound webhook events.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sportalliance.com/apis/perfectgym/openapi/general-information:
  - Pagination uses offset-based cursoring with query parameters offset and sliceSize.
    Responses include an offset field (next cursor value) and hasNext boolean; when
    hasNext is false, pagination is complete. To fetch the next page, use the returned
    offset value in the next request.
- information_source; https://developer.sportalliance.com/apis/magicline/openapi/general-information:
  - Pagination uses offset-based cursor navigation. Request parameter offset (query
    string, optional, default 0) specifies the starting position. Response includes
    offset field (next cursor value), hasNext boolean (false indicates last page),
    and result array. To paginate, use the returned offset value in the next request;
    stop when hasNext is false. Optional sliceSize parameter controls chunk size.
