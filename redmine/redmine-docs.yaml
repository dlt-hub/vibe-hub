notes:
- To enable the API-style authentication, have to check Enable REST API in Administration->
  Settings-> Authentication.
- REST API may be disabled on demo.redmine.org.
- Using login/password via HTTP Basic authentication
- This should be considered experimental until further testing.
- Users have an API token they can manage.
- Unlike other collection API endpoints like projects and issues, the versions endpoint
  does not currently seem to support pagination.
- Wiki pages can now be retrieved, created, updated and deleted through the REST API.
- For some versions of Redmine you can need some other extension of path /time_entries.xml,
  e.g. 2.5 works with *.json
- Authentication can be done using regular login/password or API key.
- API key can be passed in as a key parameter or as a header.
- Authentication can be done via HTTP Basic authentication or API key.
- Use 'X-Redmine-Switch-User' header for user impersonation with administrator account.
- Requires enabling REST API in Administration -> Settings -> API
- It's required to set the Content-Type header according to the format of the data
  you are sending.
- Uses either HTTP Basic authentication or API key for authentication.
- Requires enabling REST API in Administration settings.
- Use 'X-Redmine-Switch-User' header for user impersonation with admin account
- Default limit for collection resources is 25, maximum is 100
- Use a valid API key for authentication
- Check 'Enable REST API' in Administration settings
- A POST request on Redmine 1.0.1-2 (Debian stable) does not work using the API key,
  but does work with a login/passwd authentication
- This endpoint requires admin privileges.
