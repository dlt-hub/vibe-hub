auth_info:
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis:
  - Buildkite uses bearer token authentication for both REST and GraphQL APIs. Generate
    an API access token via the Buildkite dashboard, then include it in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer $TOKEN" when making requests to https://api.buildkite.com. Tokens
    require appropriate scopes; GraphQL API access requires the "Enable GraphQL API
    Access" permission.
  - 'The Buildkite REST and GraphQL APIs require bearer token authentication. Include
    an access token in the Authorization HTTP header using the format "Authorization:
    Bearer $TOKEN". Generate an access token from the Buildkite user API access tokens
    page. Tokens can be assigned different scopes to control permissions.'
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/agent-api:
  - 'The agent REST API uses an agent token for authentication. Set the Authorization
    HTTP header to the string "Token" followed by a space and the agent token value.
    Example: Authorization: Token $TOKEN'
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/managing-api-tokens:
  - Buildkite API uses access tokens issued to individual user accounts. Tokens are
    created in personal settings and scoped to specific organizations and permissions.
    Send the token in the Authorization header as a bearer token to authenticate requests.
    Token scopes include read_agents, write_agents, and others that grant granular
    permissions to specific API resources and operations.
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/rest-api:
  - 'Access tokens are sent via the Authorization HTTP header as Bearer tokens: set
    `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN`. Alternatively, API tokens can be created with
    public/private key pairs, where the private key signs JWTs containing the token
    UUID as the `iss` claim, `iat` within 10 seconds of current time, and `exp` within
    5 minutes of `iat`. Basic HTTP authentication is not supported. Tokens can be
    revoked from the web interface or REST API.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/rest-api:
  - Pagination uses query string parameters page and per_page to control which page
    and how many results per page to retrieve. The API returns a Link header with
    rel="next" and rel="last" to indicate the next page URL and last page URL respectively.
  - Pagination uses the `Link` HTTP response header containing `next`, `prev`, `first`,
    and `last` relations with full URLs. Extract the URL from the appropriate relation
    and make the next request to that URL to navigate pages.
  - Use `page` (optional, default 1) and `per_page` (optional, default 30) query parameters
    to paginate list endpoints. Response includes `total_count` header indicating
    total results; continue requesting with incremented `page` value until results
    are exhausted.
- information_source; https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/rest-api/artifacts:
  - Use page query parameter (default 1) and per_page query parameter (default 30,
    max 100) to paginate through artifacts. Response includes page, total_pages, and
    total_count fields to determine pagination state and construct subsequent requests.
