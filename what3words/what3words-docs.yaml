notes:
- Each API function has a rate limit that restricts the frequency that requests can
  be sent to the API.
- If you exceed the rate limit, subsequent requests will be throttled and will receive
  a `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` response from the API until your request rate drops
  below the limit.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ensure to handle rate limiting in your implementation.
- API key is required for all requests
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- API requires an API key for authentication.
- Rate limits are applied based on user accounts.
- API requires an API key for access
- Rate limits apply for API usage
- Rate limits apply to API requests.
- API requires an API key for access.
- You do not need to add the what3words symbol to your product (if you do not wish
  to), or refer to ‘TM’ or ‘©’ on your personalised product, provided that you are
  following the requirements above and do not misrepresent that you own or are affiliated
  with what3words in any way
- The Notes Component allows users to input a 3-word address in the delivery notes
  field alongside free text.
- It provides real-time suggestions and validation, ensuring accurate address input.
- The What3words Android wrapper encompasses the functionality of the Java wrapper.
- To display the results, use the what3words address search component with specific
  key attributes.
- Make sure you replace 'YOUR-SWIFTCOMPLETE-API-KEY' with your Swiftcomplete API key
- All coordinates are latitude,longitude pairs in standard WGS-84.
- The requested box for grid section must not exceed 4km from corner to corner.
- Ensure you have a Voice API plan enabled in your account to use voice features.
- what3words address is saved against an order within the Additional Details section
  of the order page as what3words_shipping.
- In Shopify, the what3words address attributes are stored in the customers’ orders
  of the Shopify Orders REST API as note_attributes.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ensure to handle rate limiting as per the API guidelines
- Replace the API key with your own; everything else can stay as-is.
- Add Address Autocomplete to Checkout
- Swiftcomplete is now active on your checkout page
- Existing integrations will continue to function, but all new integrations should
  adopt Swiftcomplete.
- The Swiftcomplete library is more consistent with the latest postal datasets, brand
  styling, and performance standards.
- We need access to your camera to scan what3words addresses.
- You will need a what3words API key to complete this tutorial.
- Ensure that you have an async runtime installed such as `tokio` except when `sync`
  feature is enabled.
- It is required to specify the type annotation for certain functions which will allow
  you to choose between `json` and `geojson` format.
- If you encounter errors related to convert-to-coordinate, convert-to-3wa and grid-section
  requests while using the Free plan, check for error message 'Error 402 payment required'.
- Quota exceeded or API plan does not have access to this feature. Please change your
  plan.
- All coordinates must be in the range of -90 to 90 (inclusive).
- The requested box for Grid section must not exceed 4km from corner to corner.
- A what3words API key is needed for all requests.
- Ensure to handle errors related to API limits and connectivity.
- If you encounter errors or issues related to convert-to-coordinate, convert-to-3wa
  and grid-section requests while using the Free plan, please check the network panel
  for the following error message `Error 402 payment required`.
- If you encounter errors or issues related to convert-to-coordinate, convert-to-3wa
  and grid-section requests while using the Free plan, please check the network panel
  for the following error message 'Error 402 payment required' and its response, indicating
  the need to upgrade to a higher plan.
- For all requests a what3words API key is needed
- You will need this API key for your installation.
- Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual API key.
- If you encounter errors related to convert-to-coordinate, convert-to-3wa and grid-section
  requests while using the Free plan, check for the error message 'Error 402 payment
  required'.
- If you encounter errors or issues related to convert-to-coordinate, convert-to-3wa
  and grid-section requests while using the Free plan, please check the network panel
  for the error message 'Error 402 payment required'.
- Requires API key for authentication
- The Android Emulator cannot record audio; test on a real device.
- Vietnamese what3words addresses can be written with or without spaces.
- If you’re not using an LLM and need to reliably detect Vietnamese addresses in free
  text, use our Delivery Notes Component for a more robust, logic-based solution.
- Detecting and validating what3words addresses can be crucial for various applications,
  such as logistics, emergency response, and even personal navigation.
- When written with spaces, the boundary for the end of the third word may be unclear.
- If the Vietnamese what3words address contains the /// prefix, the first word start
  boundary is clear.
- Initialize the what3words API with your API key.
- Requires API key for access
- Requires an API key for access
- The Notes Component requires an API key.
- Customisation options are available for the 3-word address suggestions.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Ensure addresses are processed accurately for deliveries
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Haravan
- Requires a valid API key to access endpoints
- Requires an API key for authentication.
- Requires setup of connected app in what3words
- Requires a valid API key to access.
- To use the what3words Mapbox Maps Fragment in your app, first follow the quick start
  tutorial on the Mapbox developer portal.
- Requires a what3words API key to access the API.
- The API allows for fetching grid squares.
- Rate limits apply to API usage.
- API key required for all requests
- API key required for access
- Rate limiting may apply

- If you encounter errors or issues related to convert-to-coordinate requests while
  using the Free plan, please check the network panel for the following error message
  `Error 402 payment required` and its response, indicating the need to upgrade to
  a higher plan.
- Ensure your API key is valid and has access to the required endpoints.
- Rate limits apply to API calls.
- Ensure you have added the security exemption to allow Salesforce to call the what3words
  API.
- Requires an API key for access.
- API key required for authentication
- Rate limiting is enforced on all API calls.
- API usage is subject to rate limits.
