notes:
- The APIs specify a '-d [data]' and use an HTTP content-type of 'application/x-ww-form-urlencoded'.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Always review configuration changes. Applying incorrect configuration could lead
  to unexpected behavior or errors with gateway operations.
- When you export an XCR that contains secret fields, such as passwords and keys,
  the secret field values are replaced with the <Configured> placeholder.
- Change the password on the default Admin account to prevent unauthorized access.
- Secure Boot ensures that only authorized software is allowed to run on the device.
  Secure Boot is enabled by default.
- Change your OEM password to prevent unauthorized users from changing the default
  configuration of your device.
- All network settings require a reboot to take effect.
- Flow control is required to import XML over the UART interface.
- Hardware flow control is recommended.
- Ensure that the gateway settings are properly configured before establishing connections.
- TruPort Socket supports UDP, TCP, AES, and TLS socket types.
- Commands are terse and not echoed.
- Monitor configuration is a multi-step procedure.
- Some CPs may be reserved for specific Roles, while other pins can be configurable
  for general input or output.
- A Role, when enabled, can trigger outside events.
- You can assign a CP to more than one role, and the CP can be defined as Input in
  one role but as Output in another role.
- You can only enable one role for a particular CP at a time.
- To modify a CP, you need to first disable all Roles in which it is a member.
- When a CP Role is saved, its CP settings are saved with it.
- The maximum file name and maximum path length are 100 characters.
- The maximum directory depth is 6.
- NTP is the default settings for time synchronization.
- User privilege levels include Admin, Tech, and User.
- Connections can be initiated and accepted using Modem 'AT' commands incoming from
  the Serial Line.
- Shows and updates current status every second. Press any key to stop.
- Changes take effect immediately.
- Changes will take effect after reboot.
- The Encrypt Key is a shared secret so it must be known by both sides of the connection
  and kept secret.
- The Decrypt Key is a shared secret so it must be known by both sides of the connection
  and kept secret.
