  - 'API key authentication is required, sent via the security scheme "api_key". The
    endpoint has a restricted auth level ("x-auth-level": "restricted"), indicating
    elevated permissions are needed. Exact header name and parameter details are not
    specified in this excerpt.'
  - API key authentication is required. Pass the API key via the security scheme named
    "api_key" in the request headers. The endpoint has a restricted auth level and
    returns API usage limits in response headers (Api-Limits, Quick-Scan-Limits).
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key using the api_key security
    scheme in the Authorization header or as a query parameter. The x-auth-level is
    set to restricted, indicating permission-based access control.
  - API key authentication is required. The api_key must be provided in the security
    configuration for endpoints, with an auth level of "restricted".
  - 'The API v2 uses API key authentication sent as a request header. Include the
    header `api-key: [generated key]` in all HTTP requests. Additionally, it is recommended
    to provide a typical User-Agent string or the product name ''Falcon'' in the User-Agent
    header to bypass internal blacklist checks. Free non-vetted accounts can issue
    restricted keys for database searches, which can be upgraded to full default keys
    for data downloads like malware samples.'
