notes:
- It is not recommended to leave development mode on in production.
- These tags are only consumed by X.
- Enabling the llms.txt feature will create an llms.txt file in the root directory
  of your website
- This file will be updated weekly by a scheduled action
- All XML sitemaps return a noindex, follow directive.
- XMLRPC files return a noindex, follow directive.
- In local environments, breadcrumbs are not working properly.
- Hierarchy of a breadcrumb path might be missing intermediate nodes.
- If one of these doesn't show that is because all of the items in there were already
  indexed.
- Authors are indexed as part of the posts indexation process.
- The default suffix setting is 'The post %%POSTLINK%% appeared first on %%BLOGLINK%%.'
- Yoast SEO always outputs a meta robots tag in the <head> of every page.
- On non-public pages, the robots tag should return 'noindex, follow'.
- No robots tag should be output on 4xx and 5xx templates.
- JSON-LD provides flexibility, scalability, and standardization.
- We prefer to avoid deep nesting of properties whenever possible.
- Integrating with Yoast's structured data framework is easy and beneficial to users.
- A valid Article must have required properties like @type, @id, headline, description,
  isPartOf, mainEntityOfPage, datePublished, dateModified, author, and publisher.
- Paginated states should not be included/represented in the list.
- The contentUrl and url properties are intentionally duplicated.
- A valid ProductGroup must have offers.
- If offers is missing, we will not change a Product to a ProductGroup.
- Should be output on all public pages, except for 4xx and 5xx range error pages/scenarios.
- If any of the required fields are missing or invalid, the node should not be output.
- Updating dependencies is somewhat of a delicate process and doing so might result
  in breakage.
- XML sitemaps should be created for each public content type.
- Requests to non-existent sitemap URLs should return normal 404 behavior.
- In all scenarios, Yoast prefers to output no meta description by default, rather
  than an auto-generated value.
- When a page lacks a meta description value, an admin comment should be output in
  the HTML code.
- OpenGraph data is consumed by Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Google.
- The easiest way to revert our theme changes is to use the dedicated control within
  the app.
- Unfortunately, Shopify doesn't provide a mechanism which allows for us to automatically
  remove our theme changes when the app is removed.
- The Yoast REST API is currently read-only, and doesn't currently support POST or
  PUT calls to update the data.
- Site structure is vital for users and SEO.
- This API provides access to SEO data for the current page and other pages.
- Yoast SEO provides a formal way of managing the construction and output of meta
  tags.
