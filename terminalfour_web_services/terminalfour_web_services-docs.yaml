  : - Bearer token authentication is required. After connecting and authenticating
      via the Connect and Authenticate requests, you receive a JSESSIONID and a Bearer
      token. The Bearer token must be included in subsequent API requests; if the
      session expires, you can reconnect to obtain a new Bearer token.

  : - API Key authentication is used, sent in the Authorization header. The API key
      value is stored in a variable and inherited from the parent collection's authorization
      settings, eliminating the need to add it to individual requests. The header
      key is set to 'Authorization' and the authorization type at the collection level
      is 'API Key'.

  : - Basic Auth is required for the initial login with a TERMINALFOUR local account
      username and password. Upon successful authentication, an authenticityToken
      is returned and stored in the `session_auth_token` variable. A JSESSIONID cookie
      is also created. For subsequent API requests, a bearer token must be obtained
      via an Authenticate request that includes the `session_auth_token` parameter.
    - This API uses a multi-step OAuth2 implicit flow with Basic authentication. First,
      send Basic auth with base64-encoded "username:password" in the Authorization
      header to obtain a session authenticity token. Then make a GET request to the
      authorize-implicit/decision endpoint with the session_authenticity_token query
      parameter; T4 responds with a SET-COOKIE header containing JSESSIONID. Finally,
      use the accessToken from the JSON response in subsequent requests by sending
      it as "Bearer {accessToken}" in the Authorization header, along with the JSESSIONID
      cookie in all subsequent requests.

  : - 'Basic authentication using username:password is required for initial login.
      After authentication, obtain a session_authenticity_token and use it in a GET
      request to the authorize-implicit/decision endpoint with client_id=site_manager_client
      and oauthDecision=allow. The response sets a JSESSIONID cookie via SET-COOKIE
      header. Extract the access_token from the JSON response and use it for subsequent
      API requests by sending Authorization: Bearer {access_token} header along with
      the JSESSIONID cookie in all requests.'
