auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.houseblend.io/articles/netsuite-customer-portal-oauth2-integration:
  - NetSuite uses OAuth2 (authorization code flow, not implicit flow or PKCE) requiring
    a server to secure the client secret. A critical permission requirement is "Log
    in using OAuth 2.0 Tokens" on the user role, and integration record scopes must
    be explicitly enabled (e.g., "RESTlets" scope for RESTlet access). Tokens expire
    after two weeks requiring re-authentication. Missing permissions or disabled scopes
    result in errors like "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION" or "INVALID_LOGIN_ATTEMPT".
  - 'NetSuite uses OAuth2 for REST API authentication. The portal application is registered
    as an OAuth2 client in NetSuite and follows the authorization code flow: redirect
    users to NetSuite''s authorization endpoint at `.../oauth2/authorize.nl`, exchange
    the returned authorization code at the token endpoint `.../oauth2/v1/token` for
    access and refresh tokens, then include the access token in subsequent REST API
    requests. OAuth2 is available only for REST web services and RESTlet endpoints,
    not SOAP.'
  - NetSuite uses OAuth2 for authorization. The flow requires redirecting users to
    NetSuite's authorization endpoint with client_id, redirect_uri, and response_type=code
    parameters. After user consent, NetSuite returns an authorization code to your
    callback URL, which your backend exchanges for an access_token and refresh_token
    by POSTing to NetSuite's token endpoint with client_id, client_secret, grant_type=authorization_code,
    and code. The access_token is then used in subsequent API requests (typically
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>") to call NetSuite REST
    APIs. Administrators can configure whether users consent once or each time; if
    set to once, reauthorization may be seamless if the user's session remains valid.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used to obtain per-customer access tokens. The
    portal backend exchanges an authorization code from NetSuite's OAuth2 endpoint
    for an access token, then uses that token to call NetSuite's REST APIs (SuiteTalk
    REST). Tokens are scoped and tied to user roles to enforce access control at the
    user/role level. REST Web Services and OAuth 2.0 must be enabled in NetSuite Setup
    under Company > Enable Features and Manage Authentication respectively.
  - 'OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the
    Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` when calling NetSuite
    REST APIs. Access tokens expire after one hour and must be refreshed by sending
    a POST request to the token endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token` and the `refresh_token`
    parameter, using the same Basic Auth credentials (client ID and secret). Refresh
    tokens themselves expire after 7 days, requiring full re-authorization through
    the login flow if expired. If a refresh attempt returns an `invalid_grant` error,
    the user must re-authorize.'
