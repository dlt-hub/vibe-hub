notes:
- The REST API provides ingestion endpoints for submitting GPS and metadata.
- By default, the For (keep data) setting is set to 90 days and the Clean each setting
  is set to Custom and no cleanup day is specified. Select the days on which the cleanup
  should take place. Otherwise, the cleanup will not run.
- The Vehicle Monitoring plugin is installed in-vehicle and on a Security Center server
  and runs as a plugin role.
- For the latest compatibility information, see Supported plugins in Security Center
  on the Genetec™ TechDoc Hub.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Before installing the plugin, read the release notes to learn about the new features,
  the known issues, and the limitations.
- Ensure that the server where the plugin will be installed meets the recommended
  system requirements and is running a compatible version of Security Center.
- It is important to protect your data by scheduling regular database backups.
- The Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin is installed on the vehicle system.
- This plugin collects telematics, GPS information, and other sensor data.
- The Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin integrates your GPS tracking systems
  and other sensors in Security Center.
- The Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin collects telematics, GPS information,
  and other sensor data as GPS entities.
- There are no known limitations with the Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin
  5.10.9.0.
- To be eligible for technical support, you must install the Vehicle Monitoring plugin
  with versions of Security Center and third-party software that are certified or
  supported by design.
- Ensure that your Security Center license includes all the options you expect to
  use.
- Although it is possible to host the headend plugin role on any server, it is best
  practice to host that role on a dedicated expansion server.
- You must create a plugin role for the Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin.
- Plugin must be installed on a Genetec™ Server and all client workstations.
- The plugin is not installed on the local computer, the license (certificate) is
  invalid, or you are missing required user privileges.
- Make sure that a Genetec™ Server has the plugin installed, the role created, and
  is configured correctly.
- 'Confirm that the plugin is installed on your Security Center computer: from the
  homepage in Security Desk or Config Tool, click About > Installed components and
  look in the list for entries that begin with Genetec.Plugins.'
- 'Confirm that your system has a license certificate for the plugin: from the homepage
  in Security Desk or Config Tool, click About > Certificates, look in the list for
  the name of the plugin, and make sure that your access permissions are set to Unlimited.'
- Plugin must be installed on a Genetec™ Server and on all client workstations that
  are used to monitor incidents.
- Confirm that the plugin is installed on your Security Center computer.
- Before installing the plugin, you must update your Security Center license to include
  a certificate for the plugin.
- To ensure that the Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugin 5.10.9.0 performs as
  expected, the Vehicle Monitoring plugin must be installed on a computer that meets
  the recommended specifications for Security Center.
- The plugin role is created with default settings that suit the needs of most users.
- Ensure you have compatible versions of the Security Center Vehicle Monitoring and
  Security Center Vehicle Monitoring plugins installed.
- Each vehicle must be deployed with an instance of the Vehicle Monitoring plugin,
  configured to run in *In vehicle* mode.
- If you are setting up a headend-only deployment, data logging should be performed
  using the Fleet Monitoring plugin instead.
- Health metadata can be used to track vehicle maintenance and downtime.
- Automatic shutdowns are used to ensure that Streamvault™ Rugged appliances running
  your systems shut down properly when power to the vehicle is turned off.
- Ensure you have installed NET Core 3.1 SDK.
- If the UST500_517_DIOStatusUDP service is activated in windows, disable it.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Each vehicle must be deployed with an instance of the Vehicle Monitoring plugin,
  configured to run in In vehicle mode.
- In large systems, set the poll interval for each vehicle to manage how frequently
  you want to receive real-time updates.
- The REST API is only configured at the system headend.
- 'For 16-pin (dual DIO module) units: Deactivate Cylance and install the eAPI 16-pin
  driver.'
- Ensure that you reactivate Cylance after you install the eAPI 16-pin driver.
- For 8-pin (single DIO module) units, no additional driver is required.
- The REST API is an application programming interface that provides ingestion endpoints
  so that eternal systems can submit GPS and metadata to your system.
- To receive digital inputs and outputs from vehicles, you must configure user privileges
  sufficient to submit the outputs.
- In a system with thousands of vehicles, increasing the poll interval from its default
  of five seconds lessens bandwidth usage in your system.
- Plugin requires configuration for headend or individual vehicles.
- Data logging settings must not be enabled for headend-only deployments.
- Regularly clean your database to remove old data so that the database does not grow
  beyond its capacity.
- Automatic plugin upgrading requires the GUS Extension Plugin to be installed on
  each vehicle that must receive automatic updates.
- Genetec™ Update Service must be installed on the headend and used as a proxy by
  the vehicle's GUS Extension Plugin instance.
- GPS units are automatically created for new vehicles discovered in data provided
  by a data source.
- GPS units that have not appeared in a data source for a specified duration are automatically
  deleted.
- Requires setup of connected app in Genetec
- Some API responses may vary based on user permissions
- When selected, the system monitors when vehicles enter, exit, or reside within a
  geofence.
- The For (keep data) setting is set to 90 days
- The Clean each setting is set to Custom and no cleanup day is specified. Select
  the days on which the cleanup should take place. Otherwise, the cleanup will not
  run.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The unique identifier prefixed to the NMEA sentence is sending unexpected data.
- The `Genetec.ITS.GPS.Server.Comms.DataSources.Push.DocketPushDataSource` logger
  is displayed.
- Incoming data is displayed in the Logs section.
- The Genetec.ITS.GPS.Server.Comms.DataSources.Push.DocketPushDataSource logger is
  displayed.
- Install the Vehicle Monitoring plugins.
- Configure GPS entities for your vehicles.
- Configure digital inputs for your vehicles.
- The COM port can only be accessed by one software.
- Our serial NMEA class requires Position and Time (RMC) sentences. Fix data (GGA)
  sentences are optional and, if present, are used only for altitude.
- The Vehicle Monitoring plugin must be installed on a computer that meets the recommended
  specifications for Security Center.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'

- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'Plugin installed, but missing from Security Desk and Config Tool: The plugin must
  be installed on a Genetec™ Server.'
- Plugin is deleted before the GPS entity.
- Ensure that the server where the plugin will be installed meets the recommended
  system requirements and is running a compatible version of Security Center.
- 'Operation failed: Check the plugin role configuration.'
- In Config Tool, you see the plugin in the Plugins task, and you can add a new plugin
  role, but the role is missing the Properties tab.
