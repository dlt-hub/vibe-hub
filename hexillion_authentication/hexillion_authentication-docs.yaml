auth_info:
- information_source; https://hexillion.com/support/reference/authentication-api:
  - 'Authentication uses username and password credentials sent via POST request (recommended
    for security) or GET to the auth endpoint, which returns a session cookie named
    HexillionSession that must be included in subsequent requests. Credentials are
    submitted as form-encoded parameters: username and password in the request body
    or URL query string.'
  - To authenticate with this API, send a POST request to the auth endpoint with username
    and password as form-encoded parameters, or use a sessionKey parameter to invalidate
    an existing session. The server returns session cookies (HexillionSession and
    HexillionUser) upon successful authentication that should be included in subsequent
    requests.
- information_source; https://hexillion.com/support/reference/whois-api:
  - Authentication uses a session key passed as a cookie named HexillionSession. Obtain
    the session key from the authentication service, then include it in requests via
    the Cookie header as HexillionSession=<session_key_value>. Alternatively, you
    can send your password in the query, but using a session key is recommended to
    avoid exposing credentials in plain text.
- information_source; https://hexillion.com/help/how-to-use-centralops-tools-as-apis:
  - Use the authentication API to obtain a session cookie, then send requests to hexillion.com
    versions of tool URLs (instead of centralops.net) to ensure the cookie is included
    in subsequent requests. Your HTTP library should handle cookie management automatically
    if it supports cookies.
