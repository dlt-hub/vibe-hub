notes:
- Endpoints must be configured to use SAML and not Ws-Fed.
- Ensure no encryption or signature for ADFS trusts.
- Please do not change them as Asset Management depends on the specific names that
  are requested here.
- No special permissions are needed; the user account that’s needed to be created
  needs to be just a regular user, and not a technician or an administrator.
- At this stage, we do not support any other protocol except SAML 2.0.
- The bearer token remains active for a period of 8 hours from the time that it is
  issued.
