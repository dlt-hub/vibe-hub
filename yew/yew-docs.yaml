notes:
- By default server will listening at address '127.0.0.1' and port '8080'
- If you need the Renderer for testing or examples, you should enable it in the `dev-dependencies`
  instead.
- Uses external REST API for fetching video data.
- Make sure dependencies are wasm32 compatible.
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is `1.76.0`. Older versions will
  not compile.
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is `1.84.0`. Older versions will
  not compile.
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is 1.56.1. Older versions can
  cause unexpected issues accompanied by incomprehensible error messages.
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is 1.56.0.
- Trunk is the recommended tool for managing deployment and packaging.
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is 1.49.0. Older versions can
  cause unexpected issues accompanied by incomprehensible error messages.
- note that this might take a while to install because it compiles everything from
  scratch
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is 1.76.0. Older versions will
  not compile.
- Trunk has a bug on windows when trunk serve command fails. To workaround the issue
  you can run trunk build before running trunk serve.
- Yewがサポートする最低Rustバージョン（MSRV）は1.84.0です。古いバージョンではコンパイルできません。
- これはすべての内容をゼロからコンパイルするため、インストールに時間がかかる場合があります
- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is 1.56.0. Older versions can
  cause unexpected issues accompanied by incomprehensible error messages or outright
  fail to compile.
- Trunk will open your application in your default browser, watch the project directory
  and helpfully rebuild your application if you modify any source files.
- Uses fetch to get video data from an external source
- CORS issues require a proxy server to resolve
- サーバーサイドレンダリングは現在実験的な機能です。バグを見つけた場合は、GitHubで報告してください
- Ensure the latest version of Rust is installed by running `rustup update`.
- Remove option '--open' to not open your default browser `trunk serve`.
- Uses CORS proxy for API requests
- If you have an internal pure component that makes no use of hooks and other component
  machinery, you can often write it instead as a normal function returning `Html`
  and avoid a bit of overhead for Yew, related to running the component lifecycle.
- The `html!` macro only accepts one root html node (you can counteract this by using
  fragments or iterators)
- An empty `html! {}` invocation is valid and will not render anything
- Literals must always be quoted and wrapped in braces
- The `html!` macro can reach the default recursion limit of the compiler. If you
  encounter compilation errors, add an attribute like `#![recursion_limit="1024"]`
  in the crate root to overcome the problem.
- Suspense is a way to suspend component rendering whilst waiting a task to complete
  and a fallback (placeholder) UI is shown in the meanwhile.
- The recommended way to use suspense is with hooks.
- The `web-sys` crate with all of its features enabled can add lots of bloat to a
  Wasm application.
- Most types are feature gated so that you only include the types you require for
  your application.
- web-sys is a raw binding to the Web API
- Community crates provide abstractions over web-sys
- Server-side rendering is currently experimental.
- 服务端渲染目前是实验性的。如果您发现了一个 bug，请在 GitHub 反馈。
- 服務端渲染目前是實驗性的。如果您發現了一個 bug，請在 GitHub 回饋。
- link time optimization using using whole-program analysis
- The nightly rust compiler can contain bugs, such as this one that require occasional
  attention and tweaking. Use these experimental options with care.
- By default server is listening at address '127.0.0.1' and port '8080'.
- This version of Yew is no longer actively maintained.
- In order to fix CORS, a proxy server is needed.
- Use trunk to serve the backend during development.
- Yew is a modern Rust framework for building front-end web apps using WebAssembly.
- This will fail if the socket is being used by another application.
- By default server will listening at address '127.0.0.1' and port '8080'.
- In order to fix CORS, a proxy server is required.
- デフォルトでは、サーバーはアドレス '127.0.0.1' のポート '8080' でリッスンします
- CORS issues may require a proxy server.
- You only need feature `csr` if you are building an application.
- If you are making a library, do not enable this feature as it will pull in client-side
  rendering logic into the server-side rendering bundle.
- The server will be listening at address '127.0.0.1' and port '8080'.
- Uses NodeRef to manage event listeners in a concise way.
- List of available events for web_sys
- For up-to-date documentation, see the latest version (0.21).
- BrowserRouter is highly recommended when using yew-router in browser environment.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Every component has an associated properties type which describes what is passed
  down from the parent.
- 'Use #[derive(Properties)] to automatically generate the implementation.'
- Requires the rust-src component. `rustup +nightly component add rust-src`
- To change the port, edit Trunk.toml to set 'port = 8000'
- CORS issues require a proxy server to function correctly.
- Trunk will listen on port '8080' by default.
- Ensure dependencies are wasm32 compatible to run the application.
- Use a proxy server to avoid CORS issues.
- Yew supports the minimum Rust version (MSRV) is 1.49.0. Older versions may lead
  to unexpected issues with difficult-to-understand error messages.
- Trunk will automatically rebuild your application when any source code files are
  modified.
- Uses `gloo-net` for fetch calls.
- Ensure dependencies are compatible with `wasm32`.
- Yew supports a minimum Rust version (MSRV) of 1.84.0. Older versions will not compile.
- This may take some time to install as it will compile everything from scratch.
- Remove option '--open' to not open your default browser
- CORS issues require a proxy server for local development.
- TargetCast was designed to feel very similar to JsCast
- Using NodeRef can simplify event handling in Yew components
errors:
- 'CORS: Use a proxy server to handle CORS issues'
- 'CORS error: Use a proxy server to resolve.'
