notes:
- 'The key will be presented to you only once: immediately copy it someplace safe.'
- In a production environment, do not hard-code your key.
- You can also upload base64 encoded images as data URIs.
- Your API key should never be hard-coded into your application.
- Ensure your key is stored securely.
- All URLs must be HTTPS.
- The length of any single URL should not exceed 2048 characters.
- The file size of the image asset that the URL points to should not exceed 16MB.
- The length of the encoded data URI must be under 5MB.
- The output member will contain one or more URLs that link to the result of your
  generation.
- These URLs are ephemeral and will expire within 24-48 hours.
- Each call to Runway’s API defaults to auto moderation levels.
- If your account makes too many moderated requests we will suspend it.
- Sales tax may be applied to the charge depending on your location.
- If the payment fails, we’ll notify you by email.
- Each organization in the API is subject to a set of limits. These limits are per-organization,
  not per-API key.
- If you exceed the maximum daily generations limit, you’ll receive a `429 Too Many
  Requests` response.
- You can upload base64 encoded images as data URIs.
- URLs must reference a domain name, not an IP address.
- The server should respond with valid `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers.
- Redirects are not followed. If the URL returns a 3XX response code, the request
  is considered failed.
- The length of any single URL should not exceed `2048` characters.
- The file size of the image asset that the URL points to should not exceed `16MB`.
- The server responding to the request must support HTTP `HEAD` requests.
- Keep your integration secure by ensuring your API key is not hard-coded.
- No maximum requests-per-minute limit as long as requests are within maximum daily
  generations limit.
- Autobilling requires a payment method through Stripe
- The recharge amount must be at least 1000 credits (or $10)
- Each call to Runway’s API defaults to `auto` moderation levels.
