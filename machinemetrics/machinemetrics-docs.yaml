auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.machinemetrics.com/docs/guides/authentication/auth-overview:
  - Bearer token authentication using an API key. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer INSERT_API_KEY_HERE" for all requests to both REST endpoints
    and GraphQL. The header name is "Authorization" (case-insensitive in examples)
    and the format is "Bearer " followed by your API key value.
  - The MachineMetrics API uses API Key authentication via Bearer token. Include an
    Authorization header with the value "Bearer API-KEY" in all requests. API Keys
    can be created multiple times with separate scopes for different use cases, and
    scopes can be adjusted anytime after key creation.
- information_source; https://docs.machinemetrics.com/docs/rest/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}".
  - JWT tokens are used for CSV report access. Send a GET request to `/user-token`
    to receive a JWT response, then append the token as a query parameter `token={{JWT}}`
    to CSV endpoint URLs like `https://api.machinemetrics.com/csv/production/{{resourceId}}?token={{JWT}}`.
    The API also uses bearerAuth authorization scheme.
  - 'The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for CSV download requests. To
    access CSV reports, first request a report endpoint with csv: true in the request
    body to receive a JWT token and download URL with expiration date. Then append
    the JWT token as a query parameter to the download URL like this: https://exampleUrl?token={{JWT}}.
    Additionally, a token query parameter (string type) is required for CSV quality
    results endpoints.'
