notes:
- REST APIs are quickly becoming the standard for communicating between applications.
- Python is an excellent choice for REST API development due to its simplicity.
- Integrate.io API allows monitoring of clusters and jobs.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Integrate.io
- REST API standards are essential to modern programming development.
- Adhering to REST API standards significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency
  of applications.
- Enable OAuth Settings for authentication
- Callback URL must be valid
- Integrate.io offers a no-code platform for moving both types of data to a central
  repository.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication — requires implementation of security measures.
- Integrate.io offers a low-code HTTP connector that can connect to virtually any
  REST API, supporting authentication, pagination, and schema mapping for seamless
  ingestion and transformation.
- Easily incorporate API integrations with Integrate.io to improve automation, scalability,
  and communication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of connected app in Integrate.io
- When using a $ sign in the call, it needs to be escaped with back slash \
- Only one bag field can be flattened per parse. To flatten another BAG field, create
  a new parse.
- 'Securing an internal REST API in the cloud requires layered controls: strong authentication
  and authorization.'
- Avoid long-lived static credentials. Issue short-lived access tokens via client
  credentials (machine-to-machine), or token exchange when needed.
- Use HTTPS. SSL Certificates are now cheap and easy to get.
- Do not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Instead give the same error on all HTTP endpoints
  (that the service is available only over SSL).
- If you are building an OAuth API, make sure you force the use of a state parameter
  to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Learn to handle large data sets effectively.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your API key or OAuth token.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '200: OK (Request successful)'
- '401: Unauthorized (Authentication failure)'
- '404: Not Found (Resource or endpoint not found)'
- '500: Internal Server Error (Server-side error)'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
