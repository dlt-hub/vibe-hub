auth_info:
- information_source; https://screenshotone.com/:
  - 'The API uses HMAC-based authentication with two credentials: an access key and
    a secret key. These are passed to the Client constructor and used to generate
    signed requests to the ScreenshotOne API endpoint at https://api.screenshotone.com/take.'
  - The API uses access key and secret key authentication. Initialize the Client with
    `Client.withKeys("<access key>", "<secret key>")` where both keys are required
    credentials passed as constructor parameters.
- information_source; https://screenshotone.com/docs/guides/authenticated-pages/:
  - 'ScreenshotOne API requires an access_key query parameter for all requests. For
    authenticated pages, you can pass authentication credentials via custom HTTP headers
    in the headers query parameter (format: "Header-Name: value"), or use the authorization
    query parameter for Bearer tokens (format: "Bearer <token>"). Alternative header
    names like X-API-Key are supported with the same headers parameter syntax. Cookies
    can also be used for authentication if the target website supports them.'
  - ScreenshotOne API uses an access key for authentication. The access key must be
    passed as the `access_key` query parameter in API requests to `https://api.screenshotone.com/take`.
    For authenticated page screenshots, you can also pass cookies via the `cookies`
    query parameter in the standard HTTP cookie format.
  - 'ScreenshotOne API uses cookie-based authentication to access pages behind login.
    Pass cookies via the `cookies` parameter as a URL-encoded string in the format
    `name=value; name2=value2`, or include individual cookie parameters like `domain`,
    `path`, `httpOnly`, and `secure` flags. Example: `cookies=__Secure-better-auth.session_token=ZFmIsN7BVPU0Fzzd9aJ7lZU4TLSvu2L2.buMSGkHDIxhT%2B7YIl6tS82eGGLAAeRzk7FMp1YiTtK8%3D`
    with `access_key` parameter for API authentication.'
