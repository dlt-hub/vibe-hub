notes:
- Make sure to specify a versionIdentifier to avoid errors or inconsistent results
  when new versions get released.
- The Redivis JS client is currently limited in functionality, and can only read data
  from tables.
- All requests to the Redivis API require an appropriately set Authorization header
  in the HTTP request.
- You should always request the minimum necessary for your application to function.
- Files represent arbitrary data blobs stored on Redivis, and are generally used for
  non tabular data.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Variables represent individual columns in a table. Their name is unique within a
  table (case-insensitive).
- Workflows were previously referred to as 'Projects' on Redivis.
- The resource type will always be 'report'.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Other statistic fields will only be populated once `status == "completed"`.
- Redivis stores data on Google Cloud infrastructure.
- Access rules are defined and enforced by the dataset owner.
- It's important to make sure that you fully cite any datasets used in your work.
- Datasets and workflows on Redivis can be supplemented with related identifiers that
  situate a resource in its broader context.
- Redivis supports HTTP strict transport security (HSTS) and is on the HSTS preload
  list for all major browsers
- Many datasets on Redivis are public, and you can browse them without creating an
  account.
- However, you'll need an account in order to analyze data, as well as to apply for
  access to restricted datasets.
- Datasets are versioned collections of tables containing data, alongside rich documentation
  and metadata.
- Datasets can be shared with other users on Redivis according to their access configuration.
- Redivis has limits in place to protect systems and guide correct usage.
- Many datasets on Redivis are public, while others have requirements for certain
  levels of access enforced by the data owner.
- Notebooks can only reference tables within their workflow, so we recommend keeping
  all related work together in the same workflow.
- If your table is larger, try reducing it first by creating a transform.
- Notebooks on Redivis offer a performant and highly flexible environment for doing
  data analysis.
- When using models stored on Redivis, we don't have to worry about whether our notebook
  has internet access.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- It is strongly recommended to use a Filter step with a cross join to avoid a massively
  expanded table.
- There are a few performance pitfalls when performing geospatial joins.
- Parameters allow you to centrally manage a set of values for use throughout a workflow.
- An update to a parameter will immediately propagate to any transform or notebook
  where that parameter is referenced.
- Comparisons are made up of one or more comparison rows.
- Several operators are supported for comparisons.
- This step can be used to drop duplicated records even in cases where no aggregation
  happens.
- Exports are subject to the corresponding export quotas and limits
- If data exports are restricted, you might first need to gain approval to export
  the table.
- Some datasets on Redivis have export restrictions which prohibit or limit removing
  data from the system.
- You can check export restrictions by going to the dataset page and clicking the
  top right button Manage access.
- Anyone with a Redivis account can create a dataset in their workspace
- Datasets owned by organizations have more options for access than datasets owned
  by users
- In order to view variables, you must have metadata access the source dataset(s)
  for the given table.
- Query results may not exceed 10GB – if you need to materialize larger results, use
  a transform for your query.
- You'll need to authenticate a Google account, and then specify the BigQuery project,
  BigQuery dataset, and BigQuery table.
errors:
- '400: The request was malformed or is otherwise invalid. Validate that your parameters
  and/or request body are valid, and that the given operation is appropriate for the
  requested resource.'
- '401: Invalid credentials. Either your request is missing credentials, credentials
  have expired, or are otherwise malformed.'
- '403: Not authorized. You do not have access to the request resource, or the scope
  associated with your API credentials does not allow for the given operation.'
- '404: Not found. The resource could not be found. Note that if you don''t have the
  ability to view a resource, the API will typically return a 404 to avoid revealing
  the existence of that resource, even though this is really an authorization / access
  error.'
- '500: Internal error. This means an unexpected internal error has occurred. You
  can retry the request, or contact Redivis support if the problem persists.'
- '403 Not authorized: If your request is in conflict with any export restrictions.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Check OAuth credentials or token expiration.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
