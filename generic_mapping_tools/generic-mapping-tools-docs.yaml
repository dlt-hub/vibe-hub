notes:
- No actual processing of the data or further calculation will be done here.
- Requires Internet access to compile and run the example code.
- The program may take some time to execute depending on the gridding process.
- Uses GMT_Create_Session to initialize a new GMT session.
- By default, you are only allowed to read a data source once; the source is then
  flagged as having been read and subsequent attempts to read from the same source
  will result in a warning and no reading takes place.
- Supports multiple modes for calling modules.
- Requires proper initialization before taking FFT.
- 1-D and 2-D FFT are fully normalized.
- Results are returned via the data array.
- GMT is available on Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD.
- Source and binary packages are provided for the latest release.
- The installers are always built for the latest macOS version only.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- We are laying the groundwork for more dynamic documentation.
- All modules can now read data via external URL addresses.
- All programs now use consistent, standardized choices for plot dimension units.
- Programs that read data tables can now process multi-segment tables automatically.
- GMT 5 only produces PostScript and no longer has a setting for Encapsulated PostScript
  (EPS).
- While TIME_LEAP_SECONDS is a recognized keyword it is currently not implemented
  and has no effect. We reserve the right to enable this feature in the future.
- Users who still worry about the new version breaking things may install GMT 4.5.x,
  5, and/or 6 side by side.
- The first time you run gmtswitch it will try to find all the available versions
  installed on your file system.
- GMT 6 shall be compatible with GMT 4 and GMT 5 syntax
- This is a community driven project and everyone is welcome to contribute.
- Please be considerate and respectful of others.
- Developers on macOS are most likely to want to use Xcode for this purpose.
- Install PyGMT following the official instructions at https://www.pygmt.org/dev/install.
- You can skip debugging `gmt begin`, `gmt end`, or other GMT commands by opening
  a terminal, adding `vbuild/gmt6/bin` to your path, exporting `GMT_SESSION_NAME=vscodedebug`,
  and then mixing VSCode debugging with CLI commands.

  or ulcers caused by correct or incorrect use of PSL. If you find bugs, please report
  them to the authors by electronic mail. Be sure to provide enough detail so that
  we can recreate the problem.'
- Most parameters can be changed by using set, editing a gmt.conf file, or setting
  parameters on-the-fly via the --PARAMETER=*VALUE* option to any GMT program.

- To instead plot the GMT QR code that links to https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/
  just plot the custom symbols QR or QR_transparent in plot.
- 'The angle of a contour is computed as an average over *n* points along the contour.
  If you obtain poor angles you can play with two variables: Change *n* via the **+w**
  modifier to [**-A**](#a), and/or resample the contour via [**-S**](#s). For a fixed
  *n* the **-S** will localize the calculation, while the opposite is true if you
  increase *n* for a constant [**-S**](#s).'
- Be aware that using -I may lead to aliasing unless your grid is smoothly varying
  over the new length increments.
- It is generally better to filter your grids and resample at a larger grid increment
  and use these grids instead of the originals.
- 'For the -Qs option: The PostScript language has no mechanism for smoothly varying
  colors within a polygon, so colors can only vary from polygon to polygon. To obtain
  smooth images this way you may resample the grid file(s) using grdsample or use
  a finer grid size when running gridding programs like surface or nearneighbor. Unfortunately,
  this produces huge PostScript files. The alternative is to use the -Qi option, which
  computes bilinear or bicubic continuous color variations within polygons by using
  scanline conversion to image the polygons.'
- Low-resolution raster-images appearing in PDF or PostScript files may look blurry
  when viewed with the Preview application under macOS. This happens because Preview
  decides to resample very coarse (low dpi) images instead of leaving them alone;
  we do not know of a simple way to turn this feature off.
- No plotting is performed when using the -A option.
- Each tag record must be immediately followed by either a list or region record.
- All tags should be at least 3 characters long.
- If you need to pass the list nodes via a dataset file yet be understood as a list
  (i.e., no interpolation), then you must set the file header to contain the string
  “LIST”.
- Should you need to ensure that the coordinates are unique and sorted (in case the
  *file* or *list* are not sorted or have duplicates) then supply the **+u** modifier.
- The -G and -I options are for raster images only. They have no effect when placing
  Encapsulated PostScript files.
- Modules are fully compatible with GMT 4 and 5.
- No specific API endpoints or authentication details provided.
- No default radial scale and grid settings for polar histograms. Users must run the
  module with -I to find max length in binned data set.
- GMT 6.6 is our first release after Paul Wessel has left us. Though we are still
  in a kind of orphanage state, the GMT development has not stopped. This release
  includes many bug fixes and the new and much requested Spilhaus map projection.
- In paragraph mode, the presence of composite characters and other escape sequences
  may lead to unfortunate word splitting.
- If a font is requested with an outline pen it will not be used in paragraph mode.
- New supplement module for computing geopotential anomalies
- General updates included in 6.4 with many new features
- The uppercase symbols A, C, D, G, H, I, N, S, T are normalized to have the same
  area as a circle with diameter size.
- The stroke-only symbols x, y, + and - will derive their pen widths from the symbol
  size and their pen color from -G or -C.
- By placing -S~ options in the segment headers that differ from the one on the command
  line you can change the decorated lines on a segment-by-segment basis.
- Minor revisions in 6.2 include new modifiers and options across various modules.
- Default is 10**c** or 4**i**
- New API functions include GMT_Get_Pixel, GMT_Set_Index, GMT_Open_VirtualFile, GMT_Close_VirtualFile,
  GMT_Read_VirtualFile, GMT_Read_Group, and GMT_Convert_Data.
- Vectors were completely redesigned for GMT5 which separated the vector head (a polygon)
  from the vector stem (a line).
- New programs in GMT 5 include gmt, gmt2kml, connect, get, info, simplify, spatial,
  vector, which, grdraster, kml2gmt, sph2grd, sphdistance, sphinterpolate, sphtriangulate.
- A new supplement called potential contains modules like gmtgravmag3d, gmtflexure,
  gravfft, grdgravmag3d, grdredpol, grdseamount.
- The spotter supplement has added a new module grdpmodeler.
- GMT uses the standard 35 fonts that come with most PostScript laserwriters.
- To use extra fonts in GMT you need to specify the PostScript name of the relevant
  fonts in the file PSL_custom_fonts.txt.
- GMT programs will attempt to open a file named gmt.conf.
- If your script is particularly old (GMT 3) it may also use a deprecated syntax that
  GMT no longer recognizes.
- Default line segments have rectangular ends but can be changed to rounded.
- Line appearance can be affected by the rendering algorithm used.
- Due to PostScript implementation limitations the raster images used with -G must
  be less than 146 x 146 pixels in size.
- Some PostScript interpreters may run out of memory and abort when processing complex
  clip paths.
- The drafted release notes are not perfect, so we will need to tidy it prior to publishing
  the actual release notes.
- Uses various vector plotting capabilities.
- Make sure you have an Xcode icon under Applications.
- Use specific codes for reference points to place features accurately.
- Default anchor point is often the same as the justification point of the reference.
- 'Caveat Emptor: The authors are not responsible for any disasters, suicide attempts,
  or ulcers caused by correct or incorrect use of PSL. If you find bugs, please report
  them to the authors by electronic mail.'
- Some parameters are static and are only read via the gmt.conf file.
- If $GMT_USERDIR is not defined, then the default value $HOME/.gmt will be assumed.
- When $GMT_CACHEDIR is not defined, then the default value $HOME/.gmt/cache will
  be assumed.
- Some modules automatically handle this by extending the format, but you should be
  alert of unusual situations where data may appear truncated to nearest second.

- Default applies to both.
- Types T and s can only be used with ASCII data sets.
- Default is bicubic interpolation with antialiasing and a threshold of 0.5
- Using -o assumes there are as many numerical columns as implied in -o
- To plot the GMT QR code that links to https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/ just
  plot the custom symbols QR or QR_transparent in plot.
- Coordinates for w in the range 0-1 correspond to the first day of the week [Monday]
  but can be changed via TIME_WEEK_START.
- If a temporal cycle is indicated then we implicitly set -f to indicate absolute
  time (unless already set separately).
- The -w option can also be applied to the y-coordinate instead (or any other coordinate)
  via the +c*col modifier.
- The -x option is only available to GMT modules compiled with OpenMP or Glib threads
  support.
- Different settings in the gmt.conf file may affect the output.
- Dimensions can be specified in inches (i), centimeters (c), or points (p).
- This transformation converts polar coordinates (angle θ and radius r) to positions
  on a plot.
- The angle of a contour is computed as an average over *n* points along the contour.
- 'If you obtain poor angles you can play with two variables: Change *n* via the **+w**
  modifier to [**-A**](#a), and/or resample the contour via [**-S**](#s).'
- Uses GMT for creating 3-D perspective images or surface meshes from grid data.
- The PostScript language has no mechanism for smoothly varying colors within a polygon.
- Low-resolution raster-images appearing in PDF or PostScript files may look blurry
  when viewed with the Preview application under macOS.
- When creating a document intended for printing, it is best to preserve the scalable
  vector characteristics of the default PDF file.
- Programs like PowerPoint can convert PDF to a raster for you, but best results come
  from doing the conversion yourself.
- GMT provides 90 different bit and hachure patterns that can be selected with the
  -Gp or -GP option in most plotting programs.
- LaTeX is a large and complicated type-setting system with many optional packages,
  and we simply must assume that your LaTeX installation has all the needed features.
- If the conversion from LaTeX to EPS fails, please follow instructions to run the
  conversion script manually in the terminal so you may determine what packages or
  fonts you may be missing.
- Default values for min_area, min_level, max_level are 0/0/4
- Default resolution is l in classic mode and a in modern mode
- Uses optional modifiers for drawing map roses.
- Uses HSV system for artificial illumination.
- CMYK color system requires mixing of four colors.
- Impulse responses look the same in 1-D and 2-D.
- Gaussian filter has no negative side lobes.
- 'Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then exit (Note: on Windows
  just use -).'
- Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the explanation of any module-specific
  option (but not the GMT common options), then exit.
- Print a complete usage (help) message, including the explanation of all options,
  then exit.
- By default we compute such distances using a spherical approximation with great
  circles
- You can use -jf to perform 'Flat Earth' calculations (quicker but less accurate)
  or -je to perform exact geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate)
- GMT was ported to non-UNIX systems such as Windows.
- It is recommended that GMT be installed in a POSIX-compliant UNIX environment.
- Some methods for Windows installation include Windows Subsystem for Linux, MinGW/MSYS2,
  and Cygwin.
- Custom symbols are selected via the -Sk*symbolname/*size symbol selection.
- EPS symbols are widely available on the Internet or can be created with GMT.
- The syntax is strictly enforced, meaning the opening brace must appear after then
  with nothing following it, and the closing brace must appear by itself with no other
  text.
- 'Records starting with # and blank lines are skipped.'
- GMT provides various algorithms for label placement based on the contouring and
  plotting requirements.
- Uses polar histogram for plotting
- Add -i0 if your file only has azimuth values
- If any single word is wider than your chosen paragraph width then the paragraph
  width is automatically enlarged to fit the widest word.
- Sometimes the (*x, y*) coordinates are not printed with enough significant digits,
  so the local perpendicular to the track swings around a lot.
- 'To see if this is the problem, you should do this: gmt mapproject -Af yourdata.xyz
  | more'
- 'Then if these numbers jump around a lot, you may do this: awk ''{ print NR, $0
  }'' yourdata.xyz | filter1d -Fb5 -N4/0 --FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT=%.12g > smoothed.xyz which
  performs a 5-point boxcar filter, and plot this data set instead.'
- The command must be a plotting command and modern mode syntax is required.
- If the single module involves a CPT then a color bar will be plotted below the map.
- The conversion to raster images (BMP, JPEG, PNG, PPM or TIFF) inherently results
  in loss of details that are available in the original PostScript file.
- The conversion to Geo PDFs have proven unstable and could create PDF files that
  could not be opened.
- No space is allowed between the option flag and the associated arguments.
- The uppercase symbols A, C, D, G, H, I, N, S, T are normalized to have the same
  area as a circle with diameter size, while the size of the corresponding lowercase
  symbols refers to the diameter of a circumscribed circle.
- Complex Geometries include five symbols that require two or more parameters, and
  some have optional modifiers to enhance the symbol appearance.
- GMT is a collection of freely available command-line tools under the GNU LGPL
- To include LaTeX code as part of a label, enclose the expression with @[ markers
  (or alternatively <math> … </math>). (requires `latex` and `dvips` to be installed).
- Text items such as *title*, *subtitle*, *label* and *seclabel* are seen by GMT as
  part of a long string containing everything passed to **-B**.
- 'For non-geographical projections: Give negative scale (in **-Jx**) or axis length
  (in **-JX**) to change the direction of increasing coordinates (i.e., to make the
  y-axis positive down).'
- Vectors were completely redesigned for GMT5 which separated the vector head from
  the vector stem.
- The inset module is used to carve out a sub-region of the current plot canvas and
  restrict further plotting to that section of the canvas.
- Currently, nesting of subplots is not implemented.
- If auto-legend option -l is used then you must complete plotting in one panel before
  moving to another.
- Specifying separate primary and secondary annotations via -Bp and -Bs have not yet
  been implemented.
- dimfilter will filter a grid file in the space (or time) domain by dividing the
  given filter circle into n_sectors.
- Additional filtering (e.g., Gaussian via grdfilter) of the DiM-filtered data is
  generally recommended.
- If your printer does not support some of these fonts, it will automatically substitute
  the default font (which is usually Courier).
- If no fixed point is given then we compute the azimuth (or back-azimuth) from the
  previous point.
- For the Mercator projection only, append +m to set the origin of the projected y
  coordinates to coincide with the standard parallel [Equator].
- Calculation mode for geographic data is spherical, hence -je cannot be used in combination
  with -L.
- GMT is available over the Internet at no charge.
- Width is by default measured in points (1/72 of an inch).
- 'A few predefined pen names can be used: default, faint, and {thin, thick, fat}[er|est],
  and wide.'
- Dynamic CPTs modify behavior of programs that use them
- Cyclic color tables are indicated by a cycle symbol
- Various attributes can be modified for vector plotting.
- Files file_a.nc and file_b.nc must have the same grid spacings and registration,
  and must have one edge in common.
- The reference point can be specified using five different codes.
- Resample or sampling of grids will use various algorithms.
- 'Output files have 3 columns: frequency or wavelength, spectral density estimate,
  and one standard deviation error bar size.'
- Requires reference point and optional adjustments via the -D option.
- For raster images, specify size via +w*width*/height or +r*dpi*.
- The NOAA Solar Calculator is for research and recreational use only. NOAA cannot
  certify or authenticate sunrise, sunset or solar position data.
- Some variables are optional and may have default values.
- Files whose full path is given will never be searched for in any of these directories.
- Uses FFmpeg for movie processing
- The limit on the number of concurrently open files is relatively small by default
  on macOS
- To include LaTeX code as part of a label, enclose the expression with @[ markers
  (or alternatively <math> … </math>).
- Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator for data tables
- For non-geographic axes, the MAP_FRAME_TYPE setting is implicitly set to plain.
- The annotation format may be controlled with the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT parameter.
- By default, FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT is set to “%g”.
- If FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT is set to another format it will be used directly.
- For axes with angles in radians you can specify annotation, tick, and gridline intervals
  using multiples or fractions of π.
- There are occasions when the length of the annotations are such that placing them
  horizontally may lead to overprinting or too few annotations.
- GMT relies on external tools to translate geospatial files such as shapefiles into
  a format we can read.
- Default applies to both input and output columns for the -f option.
- Default number of header records is set by IO_N_HEADER_RECS.
- Default writes all columns in order, starting with the first column (i.e., column
  0)
- Default is all rows
- Coordinates for **w** in the range 0-1 correspond to the first day of the week [Monday]
  but can be changed via [TIME_WEEK_START](../gmt.conf.html#term-TIME_WEEK_START).
- If a temporal cycle is indicated then we implicitly set **-f** to indicate absolute
  time (unless already set separately).
- Because **-w** is a global GMT option it is available in all modules that read tables.
- If your PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT is set to inch then you need to use the equivalent dpu
  of 200 pixels per inch for HD.
- If you need to pass the list nodes via a dataset file yet be understood as a list
  (i.e., no interpolation), then you must set the file header to contain the string
  'LIST'.
- Should you need to ensure that the coordinates are unique and sorted (in case the
  file or list are not sorted or have duplicates) then supply the +u modifier.
- Files that have the same names as some operators, e.g., ADD, SIGN, =, etc. should
  be identified by prepending the current directory (i.e., ./LOG).
- Piping of files is not allowed.
- The stack depth limit is hard-wired to 100.
- The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from infinite
  distance.
- The most noticeable feature of azimuthal projection is the fact that distances measured
  from the center are true.
- The Gnomonic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from the center onto
  a plane tangent to the surface.
- Mercator projection is a cylindrical and conformal, with no distortion along the
  equator.
- The transverse Mercator was invented by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772.
- A particular subset of the transverse Mercator is the UTM.
- Uses gmt grdimage to read a 2-D grid file and produces a gray-shaded or colored
  map.
- Be aware that if your input grid contains patches of NaNs, these patches can become
  larger as a consequence of the resampling that must take place with most map projections.
- If you find that the NaN areas are not treated adequately, consider (a) use a linear
  projection, or (b) use -T+s instead to plot graticule polygons.
- If -n is not set and no CPT is given (or a master CPT is given or implied), we automatically
  set -nc+c.
- The batch module can generate GMT processing jobs using a single master script.
- Each script is run in isolation (modern) mode so trying to create a gmt.conf file
  via the preflight script to be used by other scripts is futile.
- Piping in the context of batch script may corrupt the GMT history files, resulting
  in stray messages from some frames, such as region not set, etc.
- If the input file is a GeoTIFF with multiple data bands then the output format will
  depend on your selection (if any) of the bands to keep.
- These packages provide extensions of GMT that are needed for particular rather than
  general applications.
- GMT can read both ASCII, native binary, netCDF table data, and ESRI shapefiles.
- The old-style native grid file format that was common in earlier version of GMT
  is still supported, although the use of netCDF files is strongly recommended.
- GMT allows users to specify colors in CPTs in RGB, CMYK, and HSV color systems
- Interpolation between colors is performed in either RGB or HSV, depending on the
  specification in the CPT
- Impulse responses are shown here for the boxcar, cosine, and gaussian filters.
- Although the impulse responses look the same in 1-D and 2-D, this is not true of
  the transfer functions.
- The syntax is strictly enforced, meaning the opening brace must appear after then
  with nothing following it.
- The closing brace must appear by itself with no other text.
- GMT provides five different algorithms for determining where labels should be placed.
- The contouring programs expect the algorithm to be specified as arguments to -G.
- One or more attributes may be appended to the -A option using the format +code[*args*].
- All new data fields are stored as comment lines.
- The first comment line must specify the version of the OGR/GMT data format.
- Modern mode simplifies GMT by placing all commands between gmt begin and gmt end.
- If the single module involves a CPT (either explicitly or implicitly) then a color
  bar will be plotted below the map.
- While the region specified by -R determines your final output grid, internally we
  may use a slightly larger region that will allow for more intermediate grids (i.e.,
  more common factors between n_columns - 1 and n_rows - 1). This should allow for
  better convergence in the final solution.
- If you attempt gridding at the poles, you will be severely warned but the calculations
  will continue. Because the result is a geographic grid, the GMT i/o machinery will
  interfere and detect inconsistencies at the pole points and replace all values along
  a pole with their mean value. This will introduce further distortion into the grid
  near the poles.
- The solution is obtained by inverting a n x n double precision matrix for the Green
  function coefficients.
- Pre-processing your data is recommended to avoid aliasing and may also control the
  size of n.
- The STRIPACK algorithm and implementation expect that there are no duplicate points
  in the input.
- The uncertainty propagation for bathymetric grids requires both horizontal and vertical
  uncertainties and these are weighted given the local slope.
- The GMT data server hosts many tens of Gb of data sets.
- The -c option can be used to either advance the focus of plotting to the next panel
  in the sequence
- The -d option allows user-coded missing data values to be translated to official
  NaN values in GMT
- The -e option offers a built-in pattern scanner that will only pass records that
  match the given pattern
- The -f option specifies what kind of data each input or output column contains when
  map projections are not required
- The -g option is used to detect gaps based on one or more criteria
- The -h option allows specifying that input and/or output file(s) have n header records
- The -i option allows you to specify which input file physical data columns to use
  and in what order
- The -j option determines how spherical distances are calculated in modules that
  support this
- The -l option is used to automatically build the specfile that is read by the legend
  module to create map or plot legends
- Default writes all columns in order, starting with the first column (i.e., column
  0).
- Using -o assumes there are as many numerical columns as implied in -o.
- Be aware that the format in effect can lead to loss of precision in ASCII output,
  which can lead to various problems downstream.
- Unless you are using the **-:** option, selected ASCII input records are copied
  verbatim to output.
- Selection is always done point by point, not by segment.
- 'The -: option swaps the 1st and 2nd column on input and output [default is no swapping].'
- Command line arguments that may take geographic coordinates (e.g., -R) always expect
  longitude before latitude.
- If the user selects ps as one of the formats, it is recommended to first set the
  desired paper size.
- OGR/GMT files are considered complete datasets and thus you cannot specify more
  than one at a given time.
- This causes problems if you want to examine the intersections of two OGR/GMT files.
- There is a slight difference in how simplify processes lines versus closed polygons.
  Segments that are explicitly closed will be considered polygons, otherwise we treat
  them as line segments. Hence, segments recognized as polygons may reduce to a 3-point
  polygon with no area; these are suppressed from the output.
- A grid produced by grdlandmask is a categorical dataset.
- Use grdimage -nn to instead use a nearest neighbor interpolation for such cases.
- A GMT modern session can make any number of illustrations (including none).
- The line connection does not work if a line only has a single point.
- dimfilter will not produce a smooth output as other spatial filters do because it
  returns a minimum median out of N medians of N sectors.
- Changes made using set are permanent until explicitly changed back in classic mode
  and are in effect for the duration of the current session in modern mode.
- Manual changes to the gmt.conf file are in effect until explicitly changed back,
  or can be ignored for a modern mode session using the -C argument of the begin module.
- Only netCDF and native binary grid formats are can be written directly.
- Uses ellipsoidal formulae if implemented and selected ellipsoid as reference shape.
- This module is not a general editor for netCDF files. If your netCDF file contains
  more than one 2-D (or higher dimension) data layer, then only the selected layer
  will be written out if changes are requested. Likewise, if you have additional netCDF
  attributes then those will also be lost in any revised output.
- All data types can be read, even 64-bit integers, but internally grids are stored
  using floats.
- When -S is used no grids are implied and we read data into an intermediate double
  container.
- Values of -9999 indicate missing data.
- The intensity grid can be created from the data grid using grdgradient and, optionally,
  modified by grdmath or grdhisteq.
- Holes are identified by NaN values
- One of -A or -L is required
- A grid produced by grdmask is a categorical dataset. As such, one has to be careful
  not to interpolate it with standard methods, such as splines. However, if you make
  a map of this grid using a map projection the grid will be reprojected to yield
  a rectangular matrix in the projected coordinates. This interpolation is done using
  splines by default and thus may yield artifacts in your map. We recommend you use
  grdimage -nn to instead use a nearest neighbor interpolation for such cases.
- Uses Welch’s method for spectral estimation.
- Geographical grids may be used by specifying the -f option that scales degrees to
  meters.
- Wrapper module to run some of the GDAL programs from within GMT.
- Given that GMT and GDAL syntaxes are very different, this module offers a minimal
  set of GMT style options.
- The NOAA Solar Calculator is for research and recreational use only. NOAA cannot
  certify or authenticate sunrise, sunset or solar position data. The U.S. Government
  does not collect observations of astronomical data, and due to atmospheric conditions
  our calculated results may vary significantly from actual observed values.
- Default display frame rate is 24.
- If you find the output is not written with enough precision, consider switching
  to binary output or specify more decimals.
- This module is typically used in conjunction with movie where the implicit loop
  over time is used to call events over a time-sequence and thus plot symbols as the
  events unfold.
- The PostScript imaging model does not support any form of transparency.
- Piping from a non-GMT module into a GMT module or vice versa is not a problem.
- If you attempt this type of gridding you will be severely warned but the calculations
  will continue.
- Uses free-space Green functions with no boundary conditions at the edges of the
  specified domain.
- Inversion for coefficients can become numerically unstable when data neighbors are
  very close.
- The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by parameters in your
  gmt.conf file.
- The input data are assumed to contain (*lon, lat*) or (*x, y*), optionally followed
  by a *z* and a *weight* column.
- There is a slight difference in how simplify processes lines versus closed polygons.
  Segments that are explicitly closed will be considered polygons, otherwise we treat
  them as line segments.
- A grid produced by grdlandmask is a categorical dataset. As such, one has to be
  careful not to interpolate it with standard methods, such as splines.
- (1) If you need to pass the list nodes via a dataset file yet be understood as a
  list (i.e., no interpolation), then you must set the file header to contain the
  string “LIST”.
- (2) Should you need to ensure that the coordinates are unique and sorted (in case
  the file or list are not sorted or have duplicates) then supply the **+u** modifier.
- grdblend only supports netCDF and native binary grid formats for both input and
  output.
- xyz2grd reads one or more x, y, z or z tables and creates a binary grid file.
- xyz2grd will report if some of the nodes are not filled in with data.
- All data types can be read, even 64-bit integers, but internally grids are stored
  using floats. Hence, integer values exceeding the float type’s 23-bit mantissa may
  not be represented exactly.
- A grid produced by grdmask is a categorical dataset. As such, one has to be careful
  not to interpolate it with standard methods, such as splines.
- To use the -D5 option the input Mercator grid must be created by img2mercgrd using
  the -C option so the origin of the y-values is the Equator (i.e., x = y = 0 correspond
  to lon = lat = 0).
- If the new x_inc, y_inc set with [-I](#i) are not integer multiples of the increments
  in the input data, filtering will be considerably slower.
- Uses a flat earth approximation for geographic grids.
- The output of grdvolume is one or more records (one per contour if -C is set to
  search multiple contours) containing contour area volume volume/area.
- For geographical grids we convert degrees to 'Flat Earth' distances in meter.

- surface will complain when more than one data point is found for any node and suggest
  that you run blockmean, blockmedian, or blockmode first.
- If you did run these decimators and still get this message it usually means that
  your grid spacing is so small that you need more decimals in the output format used.
- -I option does not yet work properly with time series data
- 'Too many open files: Limit on the number of concurrently open files is relatively
  small by default on macOS.'
