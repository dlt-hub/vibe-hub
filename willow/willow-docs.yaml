    request to /oauth2/token with client_id, client_secret, and grant_type set to
    "client_credentials" in the JSON request body. The response includes an access
    token that is then used to make API calls to other endpoints.

  - Authentication is required to access the Willow API using OAuth2. To obtain an
    access token, send a POST request to /oauth2/token with clientId and clientSecret

    X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset response headers, with a default
    limit of 3600 calls per hour.
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>" for all requests to this endpoint.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.willowinc.com/openapi/willowtwin/v1/:
  - Continuation Token method of pagination is used. When making a request to an endpoint,
    a continuation token is provided in the response to retrieve subsequent pages;
    use this token in the next request to continue pagination.
  - Continuation token pagination is supported on many endpoints. Include the continuation
    token received in the response body as a query parameter in subsequent requests
    along with the desired page size to retrieve the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageSize (integer) and continuationToken
    (string). The response includes a continuationToken field; use this token value
    in the next request's continuationToken parameter to fetch the next page, and
    stop when no continuationToken is returned.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageSize (integer, max 32) and continuationToken
    (string). The response includes a continuationToken field; use its value in the
    next request's continuationToken parameter to fetch subsequent pages, or stop
    when no continuationToken is returned.
  - Pagination uses query parameters continuationToken and pageSize. The continuationToken
    string from the response is passed in the next request to retrieve subsequent
    pages, while pageSize controls the number of results per page. Both parameters
    are optional.
