notes:
- The Skill Quality Score (SQS) is a number between 0-5, and is designed to provide
  a measure of skill quality.
- Features are updated periodically with new capabilities and improvements.
- Create your own voice experience and deliver nearly any use case.
- Enable customers to access your music streaming service on hundreds of millions
  of Alexa devices.
- Uses Smart Home Skill API to enable device control via Alexa
- Multi-Capability Skills allow combinations of Smart Home and Custom Skill models
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- If you are creating a video skill for use with Fire TV, you should complete the
  video catalog ingestion step before you create your skill.
- Currently, independent developers can’t create Connected Vehicle skills, either
  for their own private use or for general public use.
- Use data binding to retrieve data from a separate data source that you provide.
- Change the visual experience during runtime or communicate with your skill’s Lambda
  function or web service during the interaction with APL commands.
