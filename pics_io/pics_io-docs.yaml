auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.pics.io/docs/:
  - API authentication uses JWT tokens passed in the HTTP Authorization header. Each
    request must include the Authorization header with a secret API token; requests
    over HTTP (non-HTTPS) or without this header will fail.
- information_source; https://api.pics.io/docs/how-to-upload-assets:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" where {token} is the authentication credential. This applies
    to POST requests to endpoints like /images and https://api.pics.io/images/buildS3UploadLink.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` for POST requests to the API endpoints.
    The token must be obtained before making requests and is passed as a string interpolated
    into the header value.'
  - 'Upload requests to Pics.io require a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
    When uploading a file to the URL obtained from the /images/buildGDUploadLink endpoint,
    include the header Authorization: Bearer ${token} where token is the upload token
    returned by that endpoint. The token is passed in the initial POST request to
    buildGDUploadLink with a JSON body containing metadata, contentType, and contentLength
    fields.'
