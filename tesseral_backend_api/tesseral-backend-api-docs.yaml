notes:
- All requests to the Backend API require a Backend API Key, which are secret and
  must not be put into clientside code.
- Tesseral is an open source, developer-first user management platform built specifically
  for B2B SaaS.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in tesseral
- Use publishable keys for your production Project, instead of the publishable keys
  for your sandbox Project.
- Requires setup of connected app in Tesseral Console.
- 'Use await auth({ or: ''throw'' }) for handling authentication.'
- Users can use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy to generate
  time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
- Users can use passkeys for passwordless authentication.
- SAML requires configuration on your customer’s end.
- You can configure SAML on your customer’s behalf with IDP Entity ID, IDP Redirect
  URL, and IDP Certificate.
- SCIM API Key Secret Token is sensitive. Share it with your customer only over a
  secure channel.
- API Keys feature is not enabled by default, but can be configured.
- Customers can have self-service access to create and manage their own API keys.
- All significant actions taken by users will be logged once Audit Logs is enabled.
- B2B tenant isolation is around organizations, and users live inside organizations.
- Custom Roles are not enabled by default because some customers may find them confusing
- You must enable Custom Roles on an Organization to add this functionality
- Your customer can configure authentication settings.
- Your customer can enable (or disable) primary factors like passwords.
- Your customer can require (or elect not to require) multifactor authentication (MFA).
- Tesseral supports multifactor authentication (MFA).
- 'Currently, Tesseral supports two secondary authentication factors: Authenticator
  apps and Passkeys.'
- Tesseral comes with SAML SSO out of the box.
- Every customer’s use of SAML SSO requires one-time configuration of a SAML Connection.
- Tesseral supports enterprise single sign-on for all major identity providers (IDPs)
- OIDC protocol is common for many cloud software single sign-on.
- Tesseral handles authentication-related emails on your behalf.
- Emails require specific DNS records for reliable delivery.
- Your endpoint must respond to events with a 200 HTTP response code after successfully
  processing a webhook event.
- Other status codes will be treated as an error, and Tesseral may retry sending you
  the event.
- Managed API Keys require use of the Tesseral Backend API under the hood.
- Tesseral handles automatically collecting audit logs for activity like logins, logouts,
  inviting other users, modifying login settings, and more.
- Audit logs are only supported from server-side code.
- Tesseral is an open-source project that you can self-host on your own infrastructure.
- Projects correspond to a unique deployment of an application.
- Backend API Keys authenticate your server-side code to Tesseral’s backend API
- A Publishable Key is a globally unique identifier that Tesseral uses to identify
  Projects in its client-side SDKs.
- A Publishable Key is not a secret and does not authenticate your application to
  Tesseral.
- Organizations are first-class tenants in Tesseral.
- Tesseral uses a B2B multitenancy model.
- Passkeys are secondary authentication factors used in conjunction with a primary
  authentication method.
- Each Organization will have either zero SAML Connections or one SAML Connection.
- OIDC SSO is complex and unfamiliar to most developers.
- Each customer that wants to use OIDC SSO will require its own one-time configuration.
- SCIM provisioning requires a pre-configured trust relationship with a given Organization’s
  identity provider (IDP).
- Do not confuse SCIM API Keys with Backend API Keys.
- Each User Invite represents an invitation for someone to join an Organization.
- Once accepted, the invite will result in the creation of a User within that Organization.
- Never give out an OAuth code parameter to others. You must keep code secret.
- Never give out an OAuth access_token parameter to others. You must keep access_token
  secret.
- Google's OAuth Client ID typically ends in apps.googleusercontent.com.
- Google's OAuth Client secret typically starts in GOCSPX.
errors:
- 'Unauthorized: Recheck API Key or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '404 Not Found: If the Organization or User was deleted, you will receive a 404
  from GetOrganization or GetUser.'
- 'Unauthorized: Check your authentication credentials.'
- 'Invalid SCIM API Key: Check that the SCIM API Key is correct and not revoked.'
- 'invalid_client: Check your client_id and client_secret.'
- 'invalid_grant: Ensure the code has not been redeemed already.'
