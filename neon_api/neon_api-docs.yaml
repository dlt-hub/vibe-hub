notes:
- Each key is a randomly-generated 64-bit token that must be included when calling
  Neon API methods
- All keys remain valid until deliberately revoked
- Personal API keys can access personal projects by default, and organization projects
  if organization ID is specified
- Organization API keys provide full admin-level access to all projects within that
  organization
- Project-scoped organization API keys provide member-level access to specified project
  only
- API rate limited to 700 requests per minute (about 11 per second) with bursts up
  to 40 requests per second per route per account
- Rate limits apply to all API requests including those made by the Neon Console
- Rate limits may change - ensure your app handles 429 errors and retries appropriately
- 201 Created response includes connection URI with database, password, and role
- At least one non-protected role is created with a password
- Wait until operations are finished before attempting to connect to project database
- Values have some lag and are reset at the beginning of each billing period
- Currently only AWS platform is supported with identifier 'aws'
- Supported Postgres versions are 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 with default of 17
- Provisioner can be k8s-pod or k8s-neonvm for Autoscaling support
- Returns 204 if the endpoint doesn't exist or has already been deleted
- Only supported for Scale, Business, and Enterprise plan accounts
- History begins at the time of upgrade
- Consumption history is available starting from March 1, 2024, at 00:00:00 UTC
- For hourly granularity, consumption metrics are limited to the last 168 hours
- For daily granularity, consumption metrics are limited to the last 60 days
- For monthly granularity, consumption metrics are limited to the past year
- Azure regions are currently not supported
- If you delete a VPC endpoint from a Neon organization, that VPC endpoint cannot
  be added back to the Neon organization
- API uses path parameters like project_id and branch_id that need to be replaced
  with actual values
- Includes X-Request-ID header support for request tracking
- This endpoint is only available for Scale, Business, and Enterprise plan accounts
- Date-time values are rounded according to the specified granularity
errors:
- 'HTTP 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded - 700 requests per minute with
  bursts up to 40 requests per second per route'
