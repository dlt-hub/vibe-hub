auth_info:
- information_source; https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/reference/rest/v2-overview:
  - The documentation references Google-provided client libraries and mentions that
    this is a Google API service (dialogflow.googleapis.com). Google APIs use OAuth
    2.0 authentication. Requests must include a valid OAuth 2.0 access token in the
    Authorization header as a Bearer token. The access token can be obtained through
    Google Cloud authentication flows (service account credentials, user credentials,
    or application default credentials). No API key or custom header names are explicitly
    specified in this excerpt.
