notes:
- We keep two years of history for all Snitches.
- Everything is in UTC.
- On the hour, every hour, Dead Man's Snitch looks to see if your Snitch checked in
  during the previous hour.
- You can manage your case's API keys on your case's API Keys page.
- We do not sell our users’ private personal information. Full stop.
- In rare cases jobs may not be run or run twice.
- The app isn’t formatted for the X-family of iPhone screens.
- Monitoring the system while we work to catch up.
- No authentication required for accessing incident data.
- Field Agent is designed to wrap the execution of a script or command.
- It's important that your scripts exit cleanly (e.g. `exit 0`) if they run without
  an error.
- It checks to make sure your process hit the URL at least once each period (UTC).
- Pausing a Snitch will not automatically acknowledge alerts in ilert.
- Create an API Integration with appropriate permissions in Opsgenie
- Fill in the API key created in Opsgenie when integrating with Dead Man's Snitch
- Webhooks support HTTP Basic Authentication using credentials provided in the hook's
  URL.
- We strongly recommend, for security reasons, that hook target urls require authentication
  and use HTTPS.
- There is a hard timeout of 30 seconds on all webhooks. Any request that takes longer
  than 30s will be considered an error and will be retried.
errors:
- '404: The requested resource was not found.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Access denied. Provide your API Key as the user for HTTP Basic
  Authentication.'
- '422 Unprocessable Entity: The requested resource attributes are not valid.'
- '404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.'
- 'api_key_invalid: Access denied. Provide your API Key as the user for HTTP Basic
  Authentication.'
- Exit status code (0 is good, everything else is an error)
- 'Rate limits: After the first 10 pings in an hour, Snitches are limited to one hit
  per minute.'
