notes:
- The client uses a plain-text protocol to exchange information with the game.
- UnrealCV 4.27-stable supports UDS on Linux
- The image resolution and port is configured in the config file.
- Depth is retrieved as a numpy array.
- When using the plugin in the editor, it is strongly recommend to turn off the setting
  'Editor Preference -> General -> Misc. -> Use Less CPU when in Background'.
- This tutorial assumes the basic knowledge of using a command line.
- If you are a windows user and do not have much knowledge of using command line and
  find it difficult to understand, please let us know.
- An easy to remember name that people can refer to the binary you created
- Author name and contact information
- What this virtual world is designed for? Generating dataset, reinforcement learning,
  etc.??
- It can be a release version such as v0.3, a git short sha version, or a pointer
  to a commit of your fork.
- Please host binaries in your website, if you have difficulties finding a place to
  host content, we can help you find some free solutions. Please also include which
  platform (win,mac,linux) your binaries are built for.
- UnrealCV provides commands useful for computer vision researchers.
- Commands can be typed into a built-in console.
- Model Zoo is still experimental. If you are a beginner, we highly recommend you
  start with RealisitcRendering to avoid unknown bugs.
- Issues and workaround can be found in issue tracker.
- If the plugin crashed the editor, please send us your crash log to help us figure
  out what is going wrong.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'UnrealCV server is not running: Run the game downloaded from http://unrealcv.github.io

- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
