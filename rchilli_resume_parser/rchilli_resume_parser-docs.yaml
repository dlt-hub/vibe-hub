    into the RChilli My Account portal at myaccount.rchilli.com with your email and

    requests; the documentation indicates the key should be sent with API calls, though
    the specific header or parameter name for passing the ApiKey is not detailed in

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.rchilli.com/kc/c_RChilli_search_match_pagination:
  - Pagination in My Account contains 10 pages by default. Users navigate through
    results by clicking pagination numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) to view further results
    on the next page.
  - Pagination uses pageStart (integer, optional, default 0) and pageSize (integer,
    optional) request parameters to control which batch of records to fetch. The response
    includes count (total records), pageStart, pageSize, and records array; construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing pageStart by pageSize to fetch the next batch.
