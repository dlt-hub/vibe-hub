notes:
- The new Squid widget comes with a new theming system to better match your brand.
- The API offers nearly the full functionality of the SDK, and is only missing some
  helper functions for front end work.
- Squid aims for 100% up-time with multiple guardrails in place to prevent unintended
  downtime.
- Seamless and simple integration through Squid’s API, SDK, or frontend widget
- Provide your users superior user experience, pricing and settlement times
- Enable contract interactions in the same transaction before or after the cross-chain
  swap
- Guaranteed completion or refund
- The deposit transfer must be initiated within 20 seconds of receiving the depositAddress
  from the deposit-address endpoint.
- You must request an integrator ID (API Key) which will be sent to your email.
- Coral uses a hub-and-spoke architecture with an intent-based protocol design.
- Smart contracts are audited, non-upgradeable, and ownerless, ensuring security and
  neutrality.
- Squid's smart contracts are designed to never hold liquidity, they only orchestrate
  calls to DEXs, Axelar, and any other involved contracts. They do this, and deal
  with edge cases around cross-chain mechanics. This avoids security risks usually
  associated with token bridges.
- Squid emphasizes the security of its platform and the safety of users' assets. Regular
  audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of Squid’s smart contracts
  and protocols.
errors:
- There is insufficient liquidity for this trade. Please decrease your input amount.
- The input amount is not high enough to cover the bridge fee. Please send more than
  $${amountNeeded}
- Price impact is too high. Try reducing the swap amount.
- Cross-chain gas fee estimation is currently unavailable. Please refresh the page
  or try again later.
- Failed to estimate routes.
- Slippage must be between 0.01 and 99.99.
- Route not found, please contact support if the issue persists.
- Currently unable to get a quote from the Osmosis RPC
- Missing fallbackAddresses field. For cosmos tx's it must be set.
- Missing fallback address for Cosmos chain with slip44 type equals ${slip44}
- No paths found, please choose a different token pair
- Receiving gas with your swap is not supported yet for ${toChain.networkName}
- GMP Calls directly from Axelar are not supported yet.
- Bridge fees (${feeAmount} ${bridgeToken.symbol}) are higher than the value of your
  transfer (${_bridgeAmount} ${bridgeToken.symbol}). Please increase your input amount
  to be greater than (${feeAmount} ${bridgeToken.symbol}).
- Cosmos address validation failed. Invalid address
- You must provide a fallback address of a chain with slip44 type equal to 118(e.g.
  cosmoshub, osmosis)
