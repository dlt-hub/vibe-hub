notes:
- Supports Excel (.xlsx) and TSV (.tsv) file formats for uploads.
- Metadata information must be included in a specific format.
- It is possible to produce an Excel spreadsheet out of a CEDAR template for collecting
  metadata records from users.
- This method is only feasible if the template has a simple, flat structure without
  nested elements.
- Anyone accessing the provided URL must log in to CEDAR before filling out the form.
- Only users who are part of the user group will be able to submit metadata records.
- Follow best practices when building fields and templates in CEDAR
- Use snake_case format for field names
- Provide clear and concise descriptions for each field
- Use question format for boolean fields
- Apply regular expressions to ensure identifier fields match specific patterns
