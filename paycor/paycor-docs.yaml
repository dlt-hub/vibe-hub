pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.paycor.com/explore:
  - The pagination uses a continuation token mechanism. Include the "continuationTokenId"
    query parameter from the "additionalResultsUrl" field in subsequent requests to
    retrieve additional pages of results.
- information_source; https://developers.paycor.com/guides:
  - Pagination uses a continuationToken query string parameter for consumer-driven
    paging. The response includes hasMoreResults (boolean indicating if more data
    exists), continuationToken (token for next page), and additionalResultsUrl (complete
    URL for next page). Page size is fixed at 100 records maximum per request. Continue
    paginating while hasMoreResults is true, using the returned continuationToken
    or additionalResultsUrl for subsequent requests.
