auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.wildberries.ru/en/cases/82:
  - Authorization requires an API key obtained from your Wildberries Seller Account.
    Store this key in a Postman environment variable named `apiKey` and pass it as
    your authorization token with requests.
  - Most WB API requests require token-based authorization. Configure authorization
    at the collection level by setting the Authorization tab to use the environment
    variable {{apiKey}}, which will be automatically included in all requests within
    that collection.
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header. The
    token must be included as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" with no extra spaces
    or typos, and tokens may require periodic renewal to remain valid.'
  - WB API requires an API key for authorization, passed as the apiKey environment
    variable in Postman. The exact header name and parameter location are not explicitly
    specified in the provided documentation, so the precise transmission method cannot
    be determined from this excerpt.
- information_source; https://dev.wildberries.ru/en/news/144:
  - 'Each API request requires two headers: Authorization header with a Bearer token
    (the seller''s access token), and X-Client-Secret header with the service secret
    value issued for that specific service. The service secret must match the service
    it was issued for, or the request will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.wildberries.ru/en/openapi/work-with-products:
  - Cursor-based pagination using request body parameters. Pass cursor object containing
    limit (default 100), updatedAt, and batchUUID from previous response. Repeat requests
    until response field next is false to indicate all data received.
  - To paginate through product cards in trash, use cursor-based pagination. In the
    request body, set settings.cursor.limit to the desired page size (max 100). Copy
    trashedAt and nmID values from the cursor in the response and insert them into
    the cursor of the next request. Stop when the total value in the response is less
    than the limit value in the request.
