notes:
- Agents automatically discover and connect with each other.
- Unified format, clear protocol, and zero translation headaches.
- Uses proven, widely-adopted standards like OAuth2
- Authorization token must be included in headers
- FastAPI is designed for speed and supports asynchronous processing.
- It is compatible with OAuth 2.0, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema.
- Django-dependent with heavier setup
- Less flexible serialization
- TeamCity REST API is a powerful tool which lets you integrate external applications
  with the TeamCity server.
- Authenticate your request via bearer token in the header
- By default the max. list amount response will be 100
- Token based authentication is preferred for performance.
- Pagination helps users navigate through large datasets.
- It's crucial to implement pagination correctly to improve usability.
- Pagination helps improve user experience by speeding up load times.
- Effective controls are crucial to enhance user navigation and experience.
- Inconsistent pagination can confuse users and disrupt their navigation flow.
- Too many page links can overwhelm users. Instead, limit the number of visible page
  links and provide 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons for easier navigation.
- Mobile users should find it easy to tap on pagination links without zooming in or
  struggling with small touch targets.
- Page controls should be accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities.
  Ensure keyboard navigability and proper screen reader support.
- Users should always know which page they are on. The current page should be clearly
  highlighted and not clickable.
- If a user clicks on an item and then goes back, they should return to the same spot
  in the pagination. Not saving the user's state can lead to frustration and a poor
  experience.
- Pagination is the process of splitting the contents of a website, or a section of
  contents from a website, into discrete pages.
