auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.seamless.ai:
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. The API uses OAuth2 for authorization on endpoints
    like the Poll Company Research endpoint. Credentials must be provided according
    to OAuth2 standards, though specific header names, token acquisition details,
    and scopes are not detailed in this documentation excerpt.
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. To obtain an access token, POST to /oauth/accessToken
    with a JSON body containing client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, grant_type
    set to "authorization_code", code, and refresh_token. The response includes access_token,
    expires_at, and refresh_token. Use the access_token for subsequent API requests
    to endpoints like Contact Search.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with client credentials. Exchange an authorization
    code for access and refresh tokens by posting client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri,
    grant_type set to authorization_code, and code to https://api.seamless.ai/api/client/v1/oauth/accessToken.
    Include the returned access_token in the Authorization header as Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
    for all authenticated requests. Refresh tokens using the same endpoint with grant_type
    set to refresh_token and the refresh_token parameter.
  - OAuth2 is required for authentication. The endpoint uses OAuth2 as the authorization
    scheme. Include a valid OAuth2 access token in the request to authenticate.
  - 'OAuth2 is required for this endpoint. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token (format: "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}").'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.seamless.ai:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, default 1) and limit (integer,
    max 500, default not specified). The response contains a data array with contact
    objects. No explicit next/previous fields or stop conditions are documented in
    the provided response structure.
  - Use nextToken (string, optional, default null) or deprecated page (integer) parameter
    in request body for pagination. Response includes nextToken to retrieve subsequent
    pages. Set limit (integer, optional, default 50) to control page size. Stop paginating
    when nextToken is not returned in response.
  - 'page is an optional query parameter (default: 1) and limit is an optional query
    parameter (maximum: 500, default not specified). Use page to navigate through
    results; increment page number for subsequent requests. The response contains
    a data array with company objects.'
- information_source; https://docs.seamless.ai/:
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, default 50) and nextToken (string, default null)
    parameters in the request body. The nextToken from a response should be used in
    the subsequent request to fetch the next page; the page parameter is deprecated.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, default 1) and limit (integer,
    max 500, default not specified). The response contains a data array with company
    objects. No explicit next/previous fields or stop conditions are documented.
