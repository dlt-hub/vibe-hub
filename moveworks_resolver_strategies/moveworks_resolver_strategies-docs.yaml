auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.moveworks.com/docs/acl-platform-permissions-update-set-module:
  - The Scripted REST API requires authentication via an Authorization header. Requests
    to endpoints like GET /api/488834/moveworks/base/version must include an Authorization
    header (exact format not specified in documentation) to ensure only authorized
    users can access the custom endpoints.
  - The endpoint requires an Authorization header with credentials. The exact format
    of the auth header value is not specified in the documentation provided, so the
    specific scheme (Bearer token, API key, basic auth, etc.) cannot be determined
    from this excerpt. Include the Authorization header in requests to the GET moveworks/acl/get_access_info
    endpoint.
  - To prevent unauthorized access to the Scripted REST API, a Moveworks ACL with
    type execute is created and associated with the moveworks_user role. Access to
    the API endpoint requires the moveworks_user role assignment.
- information_source; https://help.moveworks.com/docs/update-set-modules:
  - Authorization header is required for the `/acl/get_access_info` endpoint. Pass
    credentials via the Authorization header in the request (exact header name and
    format not specified in documentation).
  - The Scripted REST API requires authentication via an ACL with type execute associated
    with the moveworks_user role. For the web chat widget, JWT authentication is used
    with a ServiceNow token provider specified by the moveworks.webchat.jwt_provider_sys_id
    system property, and token lifetime is configured via moveworks.webchat.jwt_life_in_seconds.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.moveworks.com/reference/data-api-overview:
  - Data API uses OData pagination with a fixed page size of 500 records per page.
    The response includes an `@odata.nextLink` field containing the exact URL for
    the next request, which uses `$skip` and `$orderby` parameters to fetch subsequent
    records. Pagination is complete when `@odata.nextLink` is absent from the response.
