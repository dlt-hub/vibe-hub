  - The API uses an API key passed as the `api_key` parameter in the ChatOpenAI initialization,
    with the key named 'FEATHERLESS_API_KEY'. The base URL for requests is "https://api.featherless.ai/v1".
    The API key should be provided when instantiating the client and is used for authentication
    with the Featherless API.
  - The Featherless API requires authentication via an API key passed to the ChatOpenAI
    client. The api_key parameter must be set to the value of the FEATHERLESS_API_KEY
    environment variable or directly provided as a string. Requests are made to the
    base URL https://api.featherless.ai/v1 with the API key included in the authorization
    headers by the client library.
- information_source; https://featherless.ai/docs/api-overview-and-common-options:
  - 'Most API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Send the header
    `Authorization: Bearer FEATHERLESS_API_KEY` where `FEATHERLESS_API_KEY` is obtained
    from the API keys section of your account at https://featherless.ai/account/api-keys.
    The base URL is `https://api.featherless.ai/v1`.'

    Authorization header as "Bearer {FEATHERLESS_API_KEY}" where the key is stored
    in the environment variable FEATHERLESS_API_KEY. This is required when making
    requests to the realtime session endpoints.
