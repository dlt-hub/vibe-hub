notes:
- VA is experiencing long delays in approving production access for Veteran benefits
  APIs.
- Integrating with our APIs allows you to access the most up-to-date VA data with
  the least amount of effort.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Sandbox access available for immediate development with test data.
- Production access timeline varies.
- Look up static information that is filtered and formatted for VA benefits claims.
- If you use Authorization Code Grant (ACG), submit a support ticket for sandbox access.
- If you use Client Credentials Grant (CCG), get sandbox access quickly by filling
  out the form.
- Sandbox access available with test data.
- Uses industry best practices for API security and Veteran authentication, including
  adherence to the highest industry standards.
- API may have limitations on access, calls, or use.
- Changes to API features and functions may occur.
- All consumers must be US-based.
- We do not allow the monetizing or selling of Veteran data.
- Timeline for getting production access varies.
- We encourage all apps and websites to comply with Section 508.
- Rate limiting is enforced at 60 requests per minute per consumer.
- Requests to APIs that don’t require authentication are rate limited per IP address.
- Expected availability varies by environment and whether the API is internal or external.
- Certain APIs are only available to VA teams or approved VA partners.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration.'
- '429: Too Many Requests - Exceeded rate limit.'
