auth_info:
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/api/oauth-token-exchange.html:
  - 'Access tokens are obtained via OAuth2 token exchange and passed in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The token is retrieved from an endpoint response, stored
    in an environment variable (SUBJECT_TOKEN), and sent as "Authorization: Bearer
    $SUBJECT_TOKEN" to access protected APIs. Token exchange allows an actor (identified
    by ACTOR_ID and ACTOR_SECRET environment variables) to exchange a subject token
    for a new token with different scopes and audience (AUDIENCE environment variable)
    to access downstream services on behalf of the user.'
  - OAuth2 Token Exchange grant type with basic authentication. The client authenticates
    using HTTP basic auth with ACTOR_ID as username and ACTOR_SECRET as password,
    then exchanges a subject token for an access token by sending a POST request with
    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange, audience, subject_token,
    and scope parameters to the IAM token endpoint. The response includes an access_token
    with token_type Bearer that is sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>"
    to invoke downstream services.
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/admin-guide/health_endpoints.html:
  - Sending basic authentication, the endpoint returns a response with more details.
    Basic auth credentials (username and password) are sent via the Authorization
    header using the format "Basic base64(username:password)". Administrator users
    receive detailed health information, while anonymous requests receive only a status
    summary.
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/api/scim-api.html:
  - 'Access to the SCIM API requires OAuth authorization with a bearer token sent
    in the Authorization header. The token must have either the scim:read scope for
    read access or the scim:write scope for write access. The Authorization header
    format is "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where {token} is the OAuth access token.'
  - POST `/scim/Users` requires either `ROLE_ADMIN` role or `scim:write` scope. The
    authorization mechanism is role-based access control (RBAC) or scope-based, likely
    implemented via OAuth2 or a similar token-based system where the token or authenticated
    session carries role/scope information.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/api/scim-api.html:
  - Pagination uses startIndex (1-based, default 1) and count (max results per page)
    query parameters. Response includes itemsPerPage, totalResults, and startIndex
    fields. To paginate, increment startIndex by itemsPerPage for the next request
    until startIndex plus itemsPerPage exceeds totalResults.
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/api/tokens-api.html:
  - Pagination uses `count` (integer, max results per page) and `startIndex` (integer,
    1-based index of first result). Response includes `totalResults`, `itemsPerPage`,
    and `startIndex` fields. Increment `startIndex` by `itemsPerPage` to fetch the
    next page until `startIndex` plus `itemsPerPage` exceeds `totalResults`.
- information_source; https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/api/group-requests.html:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: startIndex (1-indexed starting position)
    and itemsPerPage (results per page) are included in the response along with totalResults
    (total count). To paginate, adjust startIndex in subsequent requests; continue
    until startIndex plus itemsPerPage exceeds totalResults.'
  - Returns a paginated list of group requests with optional filtering by username,
    group name, or request status. Use query parameters page and size to control pagination,
    where page is the page number (starting from 0 or 1, default unspecified) and
    size is the number of results per page (default unspecified). The response includes
    pagination metadata to navigate through pages.
