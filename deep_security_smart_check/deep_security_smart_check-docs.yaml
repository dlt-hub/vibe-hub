pagination_info:
- information_source; https://deep-security.github.io/smartcheck-docs/api/index.html:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with query parameter cursor (opaque string, optional,
    default empty) and limit (integer, optional). The response includes Link header
    with rel="next" containing the next cursor value to use in the next request. When
    Link rel="next" header is absent, there are no more results.
  - List operations support pagination with a default page size of 25. Use the `limit`
    query parameter to specify records per page. Navigate pages using either the `next`
    field in the response body or the `Link` header with `rel="next"`.
  - 'Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with optional limit parameter. Request
    parameters: cursor (string, optional) and limit (integer, optional, default value
    not specified). Response includes cursor field to retrieve next page; continue
    paginating until no cursor is returned.'
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with optional limit parameter. The response
    includes a "next" field containing an opaque cursor value to use in the next request
    via the cursor query parameter. The limit query parameter controls the number
    of results per page with a default value (exact default not specified in documentation).
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with optional query parameters. Request
    parameters include cursor (string, optional), query (string, max 64 characters,
    optional), and limit (integer, optional, default unspecified). The response contains
    content finding override objects; use the cursor value from the response to request
    the next page until no cursor is returned.
