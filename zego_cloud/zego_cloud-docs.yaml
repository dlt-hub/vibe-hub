    require four mandatory parameters: AppId (unique credential assigned by ZEGO),
    Signature (generated per signature mechanism), SignatureNonce (random string),
    and Timestamp (Unix timestamp in seconds, allowing up to 10 minutes error). SignatureVersion
    defaults to 2.0. All parameters are sent as query parameters in the request URL.
    AppId and Signature serve as the primary authentication credentials.'
