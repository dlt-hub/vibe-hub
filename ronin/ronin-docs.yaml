notes:
- Setting the --gasprice flag explicitly is required to work around the issue with
  the provider used by Hardhat ignoring the gas price set in hardhat.config.js.
- There is a difference between unlocked supply and circulating supply.
- Circulating supply increases in the event that tokens are distributed from the original
  allocations or staking contracts as rewards to users and other parties.
- These public RPC endpoints are rate limited and should not be used in a production
  environment.
- For SLA-based RPC access, please check out our list of Node providers.
- A validator must not publish two distinct votes for the same height.
- Validators can schedule temporary maintenance, during which they don't get slashed
  for unavailability.
errors:
- 'Double-sign validator: A serious error when a validator signs more than one block
  with the same height.'
- 'Unavailability validator: If a validator misses more than 100 blocks in a day,
  they don''t earn commission and the staking reward on that day.'
- 'Unavailability validator: If a validator misses more than 500 blocks in a day,
  the validator is slashed 1,000 of self-delegated RON.'
