notes:
- You may need to remove opencv-python before running the Anipose installation command,
  so that opencv-contrib-python is installed correctly.
- The maximum number of cameras is unclear. Tested with up to 6 cameras, calibration
  works with up to 10 cameras but fails with 11+ cameras.
- Anipose uses the TOML configuration format.
- The final folder should be 'videos-raw'.
- Calibration should always be recorded with the maximum view your camera offers,
  for best results.
- The automatic calibration pattern detection can fail. Removing incorrectly detected
  frames will improve calibration accuracy.
- Uses a ChArUco board for calibration
- Calibration may take about 15 minutes due to detection
- Calibration and triangulation processes are time-consuming; calibration takes about
  15 minutes.
errors:
- Filter settings may need adjustment for optimal results.
