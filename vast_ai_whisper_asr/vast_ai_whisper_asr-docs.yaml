notes:
- HTTP and token-based auth are both enabled by default.
- If you are getting an internal 500 error it's most likely the file you selected
  to upload is too large.
- Colab is connecting to a remote Jupyter instance using SSH forwarding.
- If you close your browser, you might not be able to re-open the session.
- A simple Jupyter Vast instance doesn't have that limitation.
- You can save time by automating away the rendering of animations for batch of blend
  files.
- Ensure your instance in Vast is running to keep the Jupyter notebook active.
- Users must have a Vast account to join a team upon invitation.
- 'Clear Role Definitions: Clearly define the responsibilities and permissions for
  each role to avoid confusion and ensure effective collaboration.'
- 'Use Custom Roles Judiciously: Create custom roles when predefined roles do not
  meet your specific needs. Be mindful of the permissions assigned to ensure team
  security and efficiency.'
- Users can create keys with restricted permissions.
- Permissions can be managed through the CLI.
