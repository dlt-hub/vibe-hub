notes:
- Amazon Marketing Cloud is now part of the Amazon Ads API, providing a more streamlined
  experience with enhanced security, usability, and performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- A 30-day free trial gives teams time to become familiar with the information provided
  by a data source like Amazon, Google, or Facebook.
- The one thing that is not included in a trial is historical data, where available.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Openbridge does not employ bots, web, data, or screen scraping technologies for
  data pipeline automation.
- Employing bots, web, data, or screen scraping technologies would violate the terms,
  AUPs, and DPPs set forth by companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook.
- APIs are not unlimited resources; they have certain restrictions.
- Openbridge adopts a cautious API request strategy, ensuring compliance with established
  rate limits and throttling constraints.
- The frequency of a data pipeline process is determined and controlled by each unique
  data source, not Openbridge.
- Delays due to data source delays, system outages, authorization issues, or temporary
  account blocks can range from a few minutes to several days.
- Data sources often return NULL or empty values for metrics if we call them more
  aggressively.
- Data pipeline job schedules are driven by integration behaviors for both sources
  and destinations.
- Syncing data may require 24-48 hours for the initial sync to happen.
- The frequency of a data pipeline process is determined and controlled by each unique
  data source.
- Delays due to source response, authorization issues, or destination loading capacity
  can range from a few minutes to several days.
- Data sources often return NULL or empty values for metrics if called too aggressively.
- App authorization settings are configurable in Google Workspace by a Google Administrator.
- Data pipeline job schedules are driven by integration behaviors for both sources
  and destinations
- Once you've initiated a data pipeline, it may require 24-48 hours for the initial
  sync to happen
- This timeline can fluctuate significantly based on the source system's data generation
  speed
- As these historical requests can be demanding, they're scheduled to run as separate
  processes to minimize interference with daily, hourly, or lookback schedules
- Transaction events are typically at the API request level.
- Retries will occur for up to 8 hours.
- Messages in the DLQ will expire or no longer be attempted after seven days.
- Any error messages are supplied by the source or destination system directly, which
  allows you to look up possible reasons for an error.
- The messages in the DLQ will be reattempted at various intervals, though no more
  than seven days.
- API calls must be made when the data is known to be 'settled.'
- Many APIs do not support live, real-time data updates.
- While the document focuses primarily on data sources, destinations like Snowflake,
  Redshift, BigQuery, Azure, and others also have APIs.
- The key takeaway is that each API defines well-bounded limits, cadences, frequencies,
  and timings for data availability and delivery.
- The API provides a live transaction feed of activity each hour.
- There is no historical data for live Order API feeds.
- Dynamic API limits vary by seller and region.
- Order Items require individual API requests by Order ID.
- Amazon will not return records for sp_retail_sku_by_asin when the order count is
  0 for an ASIN.
- Reports may take up to a week to populate data after a reporting period closes.
- Reports may take up to a week to populate data after a reporting periods closes
  (e.g. day, week, month).

  admin. Once invited, you must accept the invitation.
- Monthly Storage Fees report (GET_FBA_STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES_DATA) is only available
  monthly.
- Reports are provided at a DAILY interval.
- If you have requested a report via another tool or manually, this can block us from
  collecting data.
- Once a report template is defined, you save it with a template label.
- The specific combinations you select can adjust the data present in the outputs.
- Hourly reporting 'snapshot' data feeds for the listing, condition, disposition,
  and quantity inventory, including archived listings.
- Amazon strongly recommends requesting no more than once every 60 minutes.

  for app authorizations.
- Ensure the authorizing user is either an Admin or Global Admin.
- Data is unified in each date output, and various columns are used to filter outputs.
- Make sure you are using the right Vendor Central credentials to log in.
- Different data may be reported in the API compared to the UI due to internal modeling.

- Create an authorization token using the same credentials used to log into the DoubleClick
  Search UI
- Table versioning allows for seamless handling of schema changes.
- No data is lost during schema changes; older versions remain intact.
- Google best practice is that you link no more than 300 Google Analytics reporting
  views to a single BigQuery Project. More than 300 will degrade the export of intraday
  data.
- Naming your integration something unique is important since it will be used as the
  basis for table and view names in your warehouse.
- Enabling billing is crucial for the smooth operation of certain services like BigQuery.
- Remember that costs are associated with the use of Google Cloud services.
- Typically the GA 360 data will be resident in a dataset called "ga_sessions*".
- File naming convention is designed to generate unique and traceable names for all
  file objects based on the transaction ID and the job’s scheduled run time.
- If a file is large, the system automatically splits it into multiple chunks.
- Azure Data Lake requires authorization to access your data.
- Partitioning improves performance and reduces cost, critical for compute-based SQL
  query services.
- Openbridge defaults to using Apache Parquet as the object format and Google Snappy
  for compression.
- If you currently have or plan to have, a large number of data pipelines going to
  your Amazon Athena data lake, it is advised to raise your AWS service quotas from
  the default.
- Amazon provides conservative defaults, which at scale, may create bottlenecks for
  those who have a large (30+) number of pipelines active, especially if those pipelines
  are high frequency (real-time or near-realtime).
- While we will attempt to throttle and retry requests in the event rates are exceeded,
  it is possible that the volume of pipelines can far exceed the default limits on
  your AWS account.
- As a result, this may result in load errors as our attempts to deliver data eventually
  timeout.
- Typically, Athena requires authorization to access your data.
- The container name must be lowercase, must start with a letter or number, and can
  include only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Access must be set to Private.
- 'Don’t forget to note the different names: Storage account name vs. Container name.'
- Store your access keys securely.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- If you do not change `yourbucketname` in the template policy setup will not work.
- Uses private, customer-created apps for connectivity
- Uses CloudFormation to automate the setup process of Amazon S3 and IAM for Athena
- 'Ensure firewall allows access from IPs: 52.54.227.22, 52.2.68.68'
- Shopify requires you remove the HTTPS or slashes from the store URL
- If you selected that you were approved for historical data in the Openbridge interface
  and the approval was still pending, Shopify will provide an authorization failure.
- In the event that this error occurs, please select the permission is pending option
  in the Openbridge authorization interface.
- Remember to change the *`yourbucketname`* in the policy document to the AWS S3 bucket,
  you set up in Step 1.
- Typically, Google requires authorization to access your data.
- You can schedule this query to run regularly and configure a notification to be
  sent if the query errors.
- It is suggested to leave the default interval at 1 day to reduce noise and increase
  signal.
- Your Google account status may automatically delete data in BigQuery after 60 days.
- The sandbox mode has significant limitations. As such, it is NOT suitable for anything
  other than exploring the service's features.
- If you use or switch to sandbox mode at any point, there is a significant risk of
  failed data loading and data loss.
- If you created or switched to a sandbox mode, the limits and quotas can be destructive
  to your data.
- Openbridge cannot recover anything Google Cloud deleted from its service.
- These metadata fields ensure consistent data tracking across different systems and
  platforms, facilitating seamless data integration.
- Be mindful that adding metadata fields increases the size of your datasets, which
  may impact storage costs and performance, especially with large volumes of data.
- Ensure the metadata does not include sensitive information that could pose security
  risks or violate privacy regulations.
- Typically, you will not need services for Amazon Redshift.
- Amazon Redshift requires authorization to access your data.
- Data is collected daily for various sources.
- Delivery times may vary based on the source.
- We only show warehouse destinations that you have previously configured via the
  setup process.
- Any data in your previous warehouse destination is left untouched.
- Requires an active, billing-enabled Snowflake account.
- CDP can impact storage costs.
- The system is designed to adapt and adjust dynamically to changes detected from
  various data sources.
- Whitelisting Openbridge IPs is required to connect to the Redshift cluster.
- Ensure the Security Group and database are in the same VPC.
- Remember that costs are associated with the use of Google Cloud services. Make sure
  to monitor your usage and set budgets to manage costs effectively.
- Ensure Redshift is publicly accessible.
- Configure Amazon Redshift security group to grant inbound access from Openbridge
  IP addresses.
- This naming logic applies uniformly, including for historical data or 'lookback'
  requests, regardless of the report date or request type.
- Use Secret Manager or Vault to store service account keys securely.
- Openbridge cannot recover deleted data, so it’s critical to keep table expiration
  disabled.
- Snowflake is retiring the legacy authentication processes.
- Openbridge supports Snowflake OAuth workflows.
- If you encounter a limit, contact AWS to request a quota increase.
- Athena requires authorization to access your data.
- Must have an active, billing-enabled Snowflake account.
- Storage account name must be unique across Azure.
- Container name must be lowercase, must start with a letter or number, and can include
  only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Access must be Private.
- Don’t forget to note the different names. For example, the Storage account name
  is `openbridgelake`. The Storage container's name is `datalake`.
- 'IMPORTANT: If you do not change `yourbucketname` in the template policy setup will
  not work.'
- Take note of the values for AccessKeyforIAMUser, BucketName, and SecretKeyforIAMUser.
- Congratulations, the IAM role, and policy are ready!
- Make sure to **download the credentials.csv file.** Also, **keep this file in a
  safe place.** The CSV contains your AWS Secret and AWS Key for the user you just
  created. You will need this later.
- Openbridge strongly suggests that this mode not be used with our service.
- If you started with an account in Sandbox mode or had your account converted to
  Sandbox mode due to a billing issue, Google will switch everything to a 60-day expiration.
- To edit a table or view expiration, edit and select the expiration to be None.
- The process will not work without an active, billing-enabled Snowflake account.
- Ensure session role is set to ACCOUNTADMIN to complete the setup process.
- The Security Group and database must be in the same VPC, or the connection will
  fail.
- Configure Amazon Redshift Firewall to allow access from Openbridge IP addresses.
- Keep the downloaded JSON file containing credentials for the Service Account secure,
  as it grants access to your BigQuery resources.
- Openbridge cannot recover deleted data, so it’s critical this remains disabled.
- Snowflake is retiring the legacy authentication processes
- Openbridge supports Snowflake OAuth workflows
- Choose Authorize → Select 'Bring Your Own App' → Enter Client ID, Secret, and Authorization
  URL → Authorize via direct Snowflake login.
- Snowflake is retiring the legacy authentication processes — Openbridge supports
  Snowflake OAuth workflows.
- Openbridge only supports Unity Catalog
- Openbridge requires the use of Unity Catalog for external locations.
- Openbridge will not load a record with the same ob_transaction_id. This is done
  to avoid loading records calculated to be duplicate records.
- Openbridge automates and unifies data for use in your favorite BI, modeling, processing,
  data visualization, SQL, or data science tools.
- Continuous operation of data pipelines requires a data catalog to keep track of
  these changes.
- Some objects like post insights may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- if Redshift forces SSL connections, the connection parameters need to be explicitly
  set for SSL.
- This guide covers Tableau v9.x, there might be slight variations for new versions!
- Must use PostgreSQL JDBC drivers instead of Amazon Redshift JDBC drivers
- If Redshift forces SSL connections, the connection parameters need to be explicitly
  set for SSL
- Storing fields as VARCHAR in the database is a strategic decision to ensure compatibility
  and resilience when integrating data from source systems.
- Some sources auto-expire authorization after a set period.
- Authorized access to your accounts becomes disconnected from time to time.
- Copy the client's secret when presented, as it may appear only once.
- Ensure there is no added space to the end of the ID or Secret. This may cause the
  credentials to fail if there are any extra spaces included during a 'copy and paste'.
- Most apps will not accept IP Addresses, and Openbridge does not support them either.
- The callback URL will be HTTPS; do not type HTTP.
- If Openbridge loses authorization to a data source or a data destination, data delivery
  may be adversely impacted.
- Using 'group' emails for primary user account email address is suggested for notifications.
- 'Limited Authorization Insight: Openbridge lacks visibility into authorizations
  performed by external parties.'
- 'Potential Impact on Data Collection: Openbridge is only aware of the initial link
  creation and the resulting authorization token.'
- 'Lack of Authorizer Identification: You may not know the authorizer or the specific
  account they used for authorization.'
- Support requests sent directly via chat or Openbridge team email addresses may be
  missed and untracked.
- We will generally respond within 24 hours of receiving a ticket.
- Healthchecks reflect a transactional log of data pipelines' health and well-being.
- Two fundamental types of Healthcheck errors are reported; blocker and transient.
- The SP-API uses a 'Login with Amazon' authorization process.
- Once you have authorized our app, proceed to activate the SP-API connector.
- Upstream APIs rarely guarantee a service level.
- The cadence of the upstream source will dictate the frequency and cadence of timing.
- Providing objective, measurable examples is critical to troubleshooting.
- When you submit a support request, please supply your analysis and the outputs from
  the diagnostic queries.
- API throttling may cause significant delays in requesting reporting data.
- Excessive requests can lead to temporary outages and data gaps.
- If a request experiences an issue, Openbridge will use a retry/backoff/queue system
  to handle the abovementioned scenarios.
- Exponential Backoff ensures that if the API is experiencing issues, it isn't overwhelmed
  with a flood of retries quickly.
- Not all errors are worth retrying; for example, a 404 Not Found error might not
  be resolvable with a retry.
- It's essential to limit the number of retries to prevent endless loops in cases
  where the error is permanent.
- Requests get added to the retry queue if the API frequently exceeds capacity due
  to high demand or is limited due to service degradation or outages.
- The 'thundering herd' problem refers to a volume of requests that exceed and overwhelm
  an API.
- Items in queues must expire to address the issue of unbounded queue growth.
- Pricing is based on a pay-as-you-go model.
- Openbridge does not use usage metrics like row counts, the amount of data stored,
  compute credits, etc., for pricing.
