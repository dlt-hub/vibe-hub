auth_info:
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/:
  - API key authentication is available for registered users. Unauthenticated requests
    are throttled to 15 requests per minute, while API key authenticated requests
    are throttled to 120 requests per minute. The documentation does not specify the
    exact header name or parameter name for sending the API key.
  - 'The API offers two authentication methods: API Key (registered) or unauthenticated
    (anonymous) access. For API Key authentication, include the token in the Authorization
    HTTP header prefixed with "Token " (e.g., "Authorization: Token z944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b").
    To obtain an API key, register at https://lda.senate.gov/api/register/ and then
    authenticate via POST to https://lda.senate.gov/api/auth/login/ with JSON body
    containing username and password fields; the response contains a key field with
    your API token. Anonymous clients can access the API without authentication but
    are subject to stricter rate limiting.'
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/openapi/v1/:
  - API Key authentication is supported for registered users, sent as part of the
    request (likely as a header or query parameter). Unauthenticated requests are
    allowed but rate-limited to 15 requests per minute by IP address, while authenticated
    API Key requests are limited to 120 requests per minute per user.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. For API Key authentication, include
    the token in the Authorization HTTP header prefixed with "Token " (e.g., "Authorization:
    Token z944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b"). Obtain an API key by registering
    and then making a POST request to https://lda.senate.gov/api/auth/login/ with
    username and password as JSON or form data. Unauthenticated (anonymous) access
    is available but subject to stricter rate limiting.'
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/auth/login/:
  - Username and password credentials are required for authentication. Send a POST
    request to `/api/auth/login/` with a JSON body containing "username" and "password"
    fields to obtain authentication credentials for accessing the API.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/:
  - Large result sets use the `page` query string parameter to request specific pages.
    The response includes `next` and `previous` keys for navigation; continue paginating
    until `next` is null.
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/v1/filings/:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (page=1, page=2, etc.) with response fields
    count (total results), next (URL to next page), previous (URL to previous page),
    and results (data array). Stop paginating when next is null.
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/v1/filings/\/:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter page (e.g., ?page=2) to navigate through
    results. Response includes count (total records), next (URL for next page), previous
    (URL for previous page), and results array. Stop paginating when next is null.
- information_source; https://lda.senate.gov/api/v1/contributions/:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter to navigate through results. The response
    includes count for total results, next and previous fields with URLs to the next
    and previous pages, and results array containing the current page's data. Stop
    paginating when previous is null (first page) or next is null (last page).
