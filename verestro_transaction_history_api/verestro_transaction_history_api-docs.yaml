auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.verestro.com/books/money-transfers/page/technical-documentation-api:
  - The P2P API requires x509 Certificate authentication. Clients must provide a valid
    x509 certificate issued during onboarding for all requests. Additionally, for
    encrypted payloads, send the Base64-encoded public key in the X-Encryption-Public-Key
    header, set the JWE token in the value field, and use Content-Type header application/x-jwe-encryption-body+json.
    Decryption uses A256GCM for payload and RSA-OAEP-256 for the JWE key.
- information_source; https://developer.verestro.com/books/card-issuing-and-core-banking/page/overview:
  - Use your private key to decrypt the "payload" field in the request body. Responses
    are encrypted (JWE format with RSA-OAEP-256 and A256GCM) on success (HTTP 20X,
    except 204), but unencrypted on errors. Send the encrypted payload as a JSON field
    named "payload" in the request body.
