auth_info:
- information_source; https://open.lazada.com/apps/doc/api?path=%2Forder%2Ffulfill%2Fpack:
  - The API uses HMAC-based authentication with four required common parameters. Include
    app_key (unique app ID), timestamp (request time), access_token (API interface
    call credential), sign_method (HMAC hash algorithm name), and sign (authentication
    signature) in all requests. The sign parameter is computed using HMAC based on
    the specified sign_method.
- information_source; https://open.lazada.com/apps/doc/api?path=%2Forder%2Fget:
  - The API uses OAuth2 token-based authentication. Requests require an accessToken
    parameter passed to the client.execute() method. The LazopClient is initialized
    with appkey and appSecret credentials, and the accessToken is obtained separately
    and provided when executing requests.
- information_source; https://open.lazada.com/apps/doc/api?path=%2Forder%2Fitems%2Fget:
  - Authorization Required. This API requires authentication via Lazada's standard
    OAuth2 or API key mechanism (specific header/parameter names and token acquisition
    details are not provided in this excerpt). Refer to Lazada's full API authentication
    documentation for the exact authorization header format and token generation process.
  - 'LazopClient requires three credentials: appkey, appSecret (both obtained from
    the Lazada console), and accessToken. The client is initialized with the URL,
    appkey, and appSecret, then the accessToken is passed to the execute method when
    making API requests.'
- information_source; https://open.lazada.com/apps/doc/api?path=%2Forder%2Fpackage%2Frts:
  - 'The documentation shows that authentication uses an access token passed to the
    client execute method. The LazopClient is initialized with an appkey and appSecret,
    and requests are executed by passing an accessToken to the execute method: client.execute(request,
    accessToken). The exact mechanism for obtaining the accessToken and how it is
    transmitted in the HTTP request (header, parameter, etc.) is not specified in
    this excerpt.'
