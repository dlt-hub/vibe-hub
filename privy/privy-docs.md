In this guide, we'll set up a complete Privy data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def privy_wallet_management_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://your-instance.privy.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
,
        },
        "resources": [
            "fundWallet",
            "createEthereumWallet",
            "createSolanaWallet"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='privy_wallet_management_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='privy_wallet_management_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(privy_wallet_management_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from privy_wallet_management‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Wallet Management: Provides functionalities for creating, funding, and managing wallets.
- KYC Verification: Endpoints for submitting and checking KYC status, crucial for regulatory compliance.
- Authentication and Login: Features for user authentication including code sending and login with code, supporting various methods like Apple Pay.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Privy workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@privy_wallet_management-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Privy support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:privy_wallet_management duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@privy_wallet_management-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Privy API, as specified in @privy_wallet_management-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "fundWallet" and "createEthereumWallet" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in privy_wallet_management_pipeline.py and name the pipeline privy_wallet_management_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python privy_wallet_management_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Auth is managed through OAuth2 with refresh token. Headers must include content type, accept, authorization signature, and specific app details. Tokens are managed and refreshed via a specified URL.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.privy.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python privy_wallet_management_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline privy_wallet_management load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset privy_wallet_management_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/privy_wallet_management.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline privy_wallet_management_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("privy_wallet_management_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "fundWallet" table as Pandas frame
   data."fundWallet".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure correct setup of API keys and wallet configurations. Use test tokens for development and avoid real payment methods. Manage the OAuth flow correctly, as incorrect setup can lead to unauthorized access. Consider region-specific features and limitations on plans.
