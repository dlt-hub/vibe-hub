auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.docuwriter.ai/posts/api-security-best-practices:
  - OAuth 2.0 and JWT are recommended authentication mechanisms for APIs. OAuth 2.0
    supports multiple grant types including authorization code for web applications
    and client credentials for server-to-server communication, allowing third-party
    apps to access user resources without handling passwords directly. JWT tokens
    are used for stateless authentication and authorization.
- information_source; https://www.docuwriter.ai/posts/sample-api-documentation:
  - The Spotify Web API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Developers must review the
    authorization guide to properly authenticate and access API functionalities, with
    detailed documentation provided for secure access flows.
- information_source; https://www.docuwriter.ai/posts/best-api-documentation-generator:
  - Support for OAuth2 and API key authentication mechanisms. The documentation mentions
    that Swagger UI supports these auth schemes but does not provide specific details
    about header names, parameter names, token acquisition flows, scopes, or implementation
    instructions.
- information_source; https://www.docuwriter.ai/posts/template-for-api-documentation:
  - 'Bearer token authentication. The token is sent in the `Authorization: Bearer
    <token>` header with each request.'
- information_source; https://www.docuwriter.ai/posts/what-is-a-rest-api:
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication sent via the Authorization header. Include
    `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` in request headers to authenticate. The server
    validates this API key before processing requests and will return 401 or 403 errors
    if the key is missing or invalid.'
