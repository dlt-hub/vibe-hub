auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.contentcontroller.com/automation-api/v1/:
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. An access token must be obtained by
    POSTing credentials to the /auth endpoint, then included in subsequent requests
    (likely via an Authorization header with bearer token format). A 401 status code
    indicates the auth token was missing, expired, or invalid.
  - You must obtain an application key and application secret from Content Controller's
    Settings > System Admin > Applications tab, then use those credentials to obtain
    an OAuth token via the OAuth Token Resource endpoint. Include the token in all
    API requests using the Authorization header with the format Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE.
