auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sendwyre.com/docs/authentication:
  - Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header. Submit a client-generated
    secret key (SK-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX format) to the auth endpoint first to validate
    it, then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer SK-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
    on all subsequent requests. The secret key should be a long random string generated
    client-side and transmitted only over SSL.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Generate a cryptographically secure
    random 30-character secret key, POST it to /v2/sessions/auth/key?secretKey=X to
    receive an API Key, then include this bearer token in the Authorization header
    for subsequent requests. The token becomes associated with an account after the
    first account creation request.
  - Tokens can be used as the secret key for signature-based authentication, providing
    additional security since the token is not retransmitted after initial delivery.
    Obtain the API key from POST /v2/sessions/auth/key and use it for signature authentication
    requests. For bearer token IP whitelisting, pass the secretKey as the Bearer token
    to the Create API Key endpoint with the ipWhitelist parameter. The masqueradeAs
    query parameter allows master accounts to query and transact on behalf of sub-accounts
    or users by supplying masqueradeAs=AC_XXXXXX1 (for accounts) or masqueradeAs=user:US_XXXXXX1
    (for users) in the query string alongside your own credentials; this parameter
    must be included when signing API key signature auth requests.

  - Bearer token authentication is required for account creation and API access. Submit
    the bearer token in the Authorization header for initial requests. Alternatively,
    use API key signature authentication by obtaining an API key from POST /v2/sessions/auth/key
    and signing requests with it for enhanced security. For sub-account management,
    include the masqueradeAs query parameter to perform requests on behalf of specified
    sub-accounts or users. IP whitelisting is available via POST to /v2/sessions/apiKey/:apiKeyId/ipWhitelist
    after creating an API key.
  - Send a randomly generated secret key as a query parameter to POST /v2/sessions/auth/key?secretKey=X.
    The response provides an API Key. Use the bearer token returned in the Authorization
    header for subsequent requests.

  - Pagination uses `limit` and `offset` as query string parameters to navigate pages.
    Response includes `position` (current page), `recordsTotal` (total records across
    all pages), and `recordsFiltered` (records on current page). Refer to Formatting
    Parameters documentation for complete query parameter details.
