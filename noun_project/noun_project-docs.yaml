    that nonce values must be at least 8 characters long.
  - The Noun Project API uses OAuth 1.0 authentication. You must provide your API
    key and API secret to the OAuth1 handler. In Python, use the requests_oauthlib
    library with OAuth1("your-api-key", "your-api-secret") passed as the auth parameter
    to requests.get() calls against endpoints like https://api.thenounproject.com/v2/icon/1.

  - 'Pagination uses cursor-based tokens: pass next_page or prev_page query parameters
    (strings) to navigate pages, and the response includes next_page, prev_page, and
    total fields. The limit query parameter (integer) controls maximum results per
    request.'
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (maximum number of icon results),
    next_page (token for next page), and prev_page (token for previous page). Use
    the token values returned in the response to construct subsequent requests.
