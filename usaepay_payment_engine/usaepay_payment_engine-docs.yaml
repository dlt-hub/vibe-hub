auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.usaepay.info/api/paymentengine/:
  - API authentication uses an authorization header. You must provide an API key and
    PIN in the authorization header when making requests to the REST API. Verify that
    the gateway host matches the one used to create the key, and ensure sandbox keys
    are not used in production environments.
  - 'All API calls require HTTP Basic Authentication with base64-encoded credentials
    in the Authorization header. The credentials are constructed as "apikey:apihash",
    where apihash is generated by hashing a random seed concatenated with the apikey
    and a private API pin using SHA256, formatted as "s2/seed/sha256_hash". Send the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic base64(apikey:apihash)".'
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required using APIKEY and PINHASH credentials passed
    via the Authorization header. Send credentials as --user APIKEY:PINHASH where
    APIKEY is the API key and PINHASH is the PIN hash. The Content-Type header must
    be set to application/json.
  - Basic HTTP authentication using an API key and PIN hash. Send credentials via
    the Authorization header using the format `--user APIKEY:PINHASH`, where APIKEY
    is your API key and PINHASH is your PIN hash encoded as base64 for HTTP basic
    auth.
  - Basic authentication is required using APIKEY and PINHASH credentials passed via
    the --basic flag. The APIKEY serves as the username and PINHASH serves as the
    password in HTTP Basic Authentication sent to the API endpoint.
