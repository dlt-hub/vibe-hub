notes:
- Most people can and should stick to using the standard search function.
- If the lattice parameters are very different to what you expect, check the setting
  first!
- Some systematic errors are also present. These will typically be an over-estimation
  of 1–3% for most crystals.
- Ensure that your password for your provider is correct.
- Check your 'Spam' or 'Junk' folder in case the login email has been flagged.
- Some terms are scientific terms while other terms refer to tools used in MP infrastructure.
- The Materials Project API has recently undergone a significant modernization effort.

- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The term 'band gap' refers to the fundamental gap, not the optical gap.
- DFT band structures usually severely underestimate predicted band gaps.
- Not all materials have band structure or DOS data available. If the API returns
  `None` for these, the calculation has not been performed.
- As of now, the raw VASP output files are not publicly available, but the MP team
  is working on making these accessible.
- Diffraction patterns are calculated using x-ray and electron diffraction methodologies.
- The data is generated with the MatPESStaticSet in pymatgen, with efficient PBE and
  r2SCAN workflows implemented in atomate2.
- The dataset can be bulk downloaded from MPContribs and uses the 'MatPESTrainDoc
  schema from emmet-core.
- Each MP account can create (or be an owner of) a maximum of 3 projects at any time.
- By default, projects are set to private.

  order, and not a prediction of the true ground state magnetic order

- The Materials Project uses pymatgen and spglib to determine primitive and conventional
  cells
- Treat very small deviations (e.g., ~1e-16 in coordinates) as numerical noise.
- The piezoelectric behavior can only occur in crystals that lack inversion symmetry.
- The material must have a band gap greater than 0.1 eV to exhibit piezoelectric behavior.
- The paper presents the results of our piezoelectric constant-calculations for the
  first batch of 941 compounds.
- Dielectric tensors are calculated from first principles Density Functional Perturbation
  Theory (DFPT).
- The dielectric response calculated corresponds to that of a single crystal.
- Calculations performed at 0 K on a potential energy surface.
- Properties derived from vibrational frequency analyses assume standard state conditions.
- Different methods of partial charge approximation can differ both quantitatively
  and qualitatively.
- The Mulliken method is reported to behave poorly and should be avoided when multiple
  options are available.
- X-ray Absorption Spectra (XAS) is calculated using the code FEFF.
- The spectra include extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), x-ray absorption
  near edge structure (XANES), and both are stitched together to give a total XAS
  spectra.
- Surface energy is a measure of the energy change associated with the breaking of
  intermolecular bonds in a bulk material.
- NBO processes and analyzes the optimized wavefunction produced by a DFT calculation.
- For open-shell molecules, NBO performs separate analyses on the ɑ and β electrons.
- Distance >1 suggests that the structures are very dissimilar.
- Threshold for similarity is 0.9.
- DFT vibrational frequency analyses produce a set of frequencies, their predicted
  spectroscopic activities and intensities, and the vibrational normal modes associated
  with each frequency.
- On the Materials Project Web site, we allow users to visualize the computed IR spectra
  with broadened peaks based on Gaussian and Lorentzian lineshapes.
- The properties of small molecules were calculated using the B3LYP exchange-correlation
  functional and the 6-31+G(d) basis set with a PCM implicit solvent model.
