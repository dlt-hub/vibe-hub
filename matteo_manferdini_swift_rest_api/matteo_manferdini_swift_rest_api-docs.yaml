auth_info:
- information_source; https://matteomanferdini.com/swift-rest-api/:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication uses the Authorization header set to "Basic " followed
    by Base64-encoded username:password credentials. OAuth 2.0 uses an access token
    obtained after user login, also sent via the Authorization header (typically as
    "Bearer <token>"). Both methods add credentials to the Authorization HTTP header.
  - HTTP basic authentication requires setting the Authorization header to Basic followed
    by the Base64 encoding of username:password. OAuth 2.0 authentication requires
    setting the Authorization header to Bearer followed by an access token obtained
    through the OAuth 2.0 flow. Both approaches use the Authorization header but with
    different prefixes and credential formats.
  - OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication. Access token is passed in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {token}".
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {token}" for all requests, including POST requests.
