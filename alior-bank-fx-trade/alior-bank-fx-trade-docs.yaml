notes:
- Using the sandbox is free of charge and everyone can register and use the APIs in
  our test environment.
- Scheduled unavailability of services may occur during planned maintenance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The Bank shall not charge for activities related to making the Portal available
  and maintaining thereof
- Application registration (Client ID) is mandatory.
- RSA pair of keys (Public key and Private key) of 2048 bits length is required for
  secure mode.
- Requires OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with client ID and secret.
- The refresh token can be issued for the same privileges as in the original token,
  except for situations when the TPP uses PIS services.
- It is not possible to refresh token from version v2_1_1.1 or v2_1_1.2 but it is
  possible to use this token on version v3_0.1.
- In a sandbox environment you can access our API without any certificates.
- The access_token for PIS transfer can be used only one time.
- This refresh token process can be repeated as long as you need but take a note that
  should be connected with real needs.
- The private key is required to create JWS-Signature request header.
- The public key required to verify the signature will be provided during the onboarding
  process.
