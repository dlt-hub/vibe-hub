notes:
- Extensive API can be used to tightly integrate Informatics into your existing infrastructure.
- Flexible packages to meet the needs of your solution
- Limited API access for Personal and Basic subscriptions
- Full API access for Flex subscription
- By downloading this software, you confirm that you accept the Terms of Service
- The API can be used to provide answers to common network questions.
- Standard HTTP response codes and augmented error codes are included.
- access to the API requires an API key.
- The authentication that is typically handled via an API key/token has been disabled
  for the demo.
- Some Netify API endpoints provide data in paginated format.
- Paginated data is always provided in the same order for the specified target, typically
  an internal ID number.
- API endpoints that provide data at the organization level require the x-net-organization
  parameter in the REST header request.
- API endpoints that provide data at the site level require the x-net-site parameter
  in the REST header request.
