    utilizing Client Credentials and Authorization Code flows, requiring access tokens
    and refresh tokens, with further details available in the API Reference sections
    for authentication and token management.

  paginator: Pagination is required for API requests that search and list summaries
    from a resource collection if there are too many results, and it can be controlled
    using querystring parameters such as `offset`, which specifies the starting point,
    and `max`, which defines the page size, with a default page size potentially being
    specified in the API documentation.
