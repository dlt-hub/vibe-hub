- information_source; https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/ui/index.html:
  - 'Pagination information found in response structure: The API returns paginated
    results with response fields "page" (current page number, starting at 1), "itemsPerPage"
    (number of items per page, default 20), and "total" (total count of items). To
    paginate, construct subsequent requests using the page parameter in the query
    string, incrementing it until reaching the last page (when returned items are
    fewer than itemsPerPage or page exceeds total divided by itemsPerPage).'
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (number, starts at 1) and itemsPerPage
    (number) to control pagination. Response includes total (total matching items),
    page (current page number), and itemsPerPage (items per page) fields.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 1) and itemsPerPage (default 20)
    to request pages. Response includes total (total items), page (current page number),
    and itemsPerPage (items per page) fields to navigate.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 1, optional) and an implicit
    per-page limit. Response includes page (current page number), total (total matching
    items), and an artist array. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the
    page parameter until all results are retrieved.
  - 'Request pagination using optional query parameters: page (starting at 1) and
    itemsPerPage. Response includes page, itemsPerPage, and total fields to track
    pagination state.'
