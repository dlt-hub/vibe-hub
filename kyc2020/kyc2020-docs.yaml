auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.kyc2020.io/:
  - 'API key authentication is required for all requests. Send the `apikey` header
    with a string value (example: a1b2c3) and the `email` header with a string value
    (example: john.d) in all API calls to batch job and monitoring endpoints.'
  - 'API key authentication is required via the apikey header (example value: a1b2c3)
    and an email header is also required (example value: john.d...). Both headers
    must be included in requests to this endpoint.'
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the header parameter
    named "apikey" (example value: a1b2c3) and the email in the header parameter named
    "email" (example value: john.d...).'
  - API key authentication is required. Send the email address in the "email" header
    and the API key in the "apikey" header with each request to the Alert History
    endpoint.
  - API keys are required for authentication. Each API key is unique to an account
    and must be included with requests. API keys are accessible through the KYC2020
    Single Sign-On portal. All API requests must be made over HTTPS and include authentication
    credentials; requests without authentication will fail.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.kyc2020.io/:
  - 'Pagination uses two required query parameters: page_no specifies the page number
    and page_size specifies the number of results per page. The response structure
    is not fully detailed in the provided documentation, so the exact fields indicating
    pagination state or how to determine when to stop paginating cannot be confirmed.'
  - page_no and page_size are query parameters used for pagination, where page_no
    fetches a specific page and page_size sets the number of results per page. Both
    are required string parameters. Stop paginating when the returned results are
    fewer than the page_size or when no additional records are available.
  - page_no and page_size parameters in the request body control pagination. page_no
    specifies which page to retrieve and page_size determines the number of results
    per page. The response includes a number field indicating the current page.
