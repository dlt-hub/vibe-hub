notes:
- All api calls require an Access Token using the Bearer token method.
- Blue Canvas polls your Org and looks for changes to tracked metadata.
- You can have multiple connected orgs in each column.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Blue Canvas polls your Org and looks for changes to tracked metadata automatically.
- You'll be prompted to go through Salesforce's highly secure OAuth flow.
- The connection with Salesforce is securely established with OAuth 2.0, and Blue
  Canvas never reads your Salesforce credentials.
- Salesforce Source Tracking is the one requirement for Quick Sync to operate.
- Salesforce Source Tracking 'is available in Developer and Developer Pro Sandboxes
  only.'
- Make sure that you have at least two Salesforce orgs connected to Blue Canvas.
- Deployed edits show up in the target, not the source
- Rollback must validate normally like any other Deployment Request.
- It may take some tuning to get the rollback to go through successfully.
- Merging is an important part of using source control systems.
- Merging is as easy as pressing a button.
- We support both Jira Cloud and Jira Server
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Blue Canvas
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'When syncing your Blue Canvas to GitLab you will need to use the following format
  for your URL: https://EMAIL%40DOMAIN:[PASSWORD@git.bluecanvas.io](mailto:PASSWORD@git.bluecanvas.io)/USER_ID/REPO_ID.git'
- The initial import into Azure DevOps doesn't copy binary files (e.g. Documents,
  StaticResources) because they are stored in Git LFS.
- 'Check for conflicting URL prefix: Some versions of Azure DevOps contain an additional
  prefix in the clone URL that will cause authentication errors in Git LFS.'
- Email support@bluecanvas.io to include more information in your CSV export
- Salesforce release (v62)
- We are currently aiming to disable legacy branch syncs on December 1st, 2024.
- ExperienceBundle Metadata API doesn't support the template of Aloha1.
- Require peer reviews in deployment requests when enabled, deployment requests to
  these branches are blocked until a required number of approving reviews is met.
- Require that unit tests cover at least 75% of the code when enabled, deployment
  requests that contain Apex must fulfill the same code coverage requirements that
  Salesforce enforces for production orgs.
- Require all status checks in deployment requests to succeed when enabled, deployment
  requests to these branches are blocked if any external checks have failed or are
  still in progress.
- Automatically mark checklists as deployed after approvals when enabled, checklists
  that target these branches will be marked as 'deployed' automatically after a required
  number of approving reviews.
- Requires setup of a new Okta application for Blue Canvas.
- Follow the instructions to create an Incoming Webhook on Slack and paste the URL
  into the configuration form.
- To set up your Microsoft Teams integration, go to Settings > Notifications > Microsoft
  Teams and click on Enable.
- To use this integration, you just need a free Webex account and a subscription to
  Blue Canvas.
- You can configure which days of the week this branch will sync, and at what time
  of the day.
- You can also set the sync interval anywhere from every 90 seconds to every 6 hours.
- By default, everything available over the API is synced
- See exactly what's happening behind the scenes with your branch syncs.
- This can serve as a useful and transparent audit log.
- After a refresh you will need to wait ~30 minutes after the sandbox refresh completes
  before reconnecting to Blue Canvas.
- Hover over the red triangle to see the specific error message for that org. When
  the message reads `Authentication error with Salesforce`, then you are safe to reconnect
  the org.
- To get support on any questions or issues you are experiencing, email support@bluecanvas.io
- Blue Canvas uses fewer than 6,000 API calls per day.
- A limiter is in place that will stop using your API calls once you hit 75% of your
  API limit.
- Ensure under 'Permitted Users' you have 'All users may self-authorize' selected.
- Ensure under 'IP Relaxation' you have 'Relax IP Restrictions'.
- Ensure 'Allow OAuth User-Agent Flows' is 'On'.
- It's highly recommended you use a user with 'System Administrator' privileges.
- Ensure 'Modify All Data' is checked.
- Ensure 'Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions' is checked.
- Ensure 'View Setup and Configuration' is checked.
- Ensure 'Customize Application' is checked.
- Ensure 'Download AppExchange Permissions' is checked.
- Ensure the 'Timeout Value' is 2 hours or longer.
- Ensure 'Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated' is unchecked.
- Ensure 'Lock sessions to the domain in which they were first used' is unchecked.
- Ensure 'Enforce login IP ranges on every request' is unchecked.
- The API user must have review permissions in order to use these API calls.
- Creates or updates the status of a check for a given deployment by its canonical
  check name.
- Retrieves a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz) of the file tree for the specified revision.
- Please make sure you use HTTPS in order to prevent replay attacks or make sure you
  do not execute duplicate actions.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
