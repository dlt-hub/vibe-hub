notes:
- Most Tulip API endpoints require a workspace context in order to specify what workspace
  the data should be queried in.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Establishing secure data connections may require IT personnel.
- This connector is a good starting point that implements a core set of the service's
  most common functions.
- Some configuration may be required in MaintainX to establish a connection with Tulip.
- Uses HTTP API for integration with ERP/MES systems.
- Tulip should be on the same network with Windchill.
- 'Currently there is a limitation when loading images: it only works if in the browser
  where Tulip is running, Windchill is also open and authenticated.'
errors:
