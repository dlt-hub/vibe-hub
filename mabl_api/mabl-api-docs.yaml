  `<path>` elements.
- The mabl Trainer cannot upload a file that was downloaded within a previous test
  step.
- Some API calls may have rate limits
- Mabl's product structure allows teams to reuse browser tests and flows across the
  workspace.
- If you and a colleague are both editing the same flow or browser test at the same
  time, you can accidentally overwrite each other's changes.
- While branching can help you prevent changes to your main tests, the mabl Trainer
  also prompts users with a Save Conflict warning to prevent accidental overwrites.
- Replay of the auto-login flow in the mabl Trainer is not supported.
- 'Auto-login flow does not work in the following situations: The application requires
  more than a username and password to log in, the login page isn''t in English, the
  attributes for the username and password fields are not descriptive enough for mabl
  to recognize as username and password fields.'
- 'Auto-login flows can only use mabl credentials, which have the following limitations:
  Mabl credentials are not environment-specific, tests that run in the same plan can
  only use one set of mabl credentials.'

- The MFA (TOTP) authenticator code refreshes every 30 seconds.
- After 30 seconds, the temporary authentication code is invalid.
- 'Mabl credentials have two limitations: You cannot configure mabl credentials per
  environment and plans can only use one set of mabl credentials.'
- Requires setup of connected app in mabl
- Finding the correct element during test execution can present an interesting challenge.
- Mabl leverages a wide range of strategies to find the correct element based on the
  interactions recorded with your application.
- Mabl supports automating tests for applications that use Time-based one-time password
  (TOTP) authentication and Email one-time password (OTP) authentication.
- Mabl does not support automating login for apps that use Okta Verify QR Codes, Webauthn,
  FIDO, such as USB Yubikeys, or SMS 2FA.
- API requires authentication.
- During test execution, mabl only considers elements that match ALL the selected
  Configure Find values before either failing or attempting to auto-heal.
- Only select the most important attributes to ensure that the step is not over-constrained.
- Prior to general availability, functionality is subject to change.
- API requires authentication via OAuth2.
- After creating MFA credentials, you're ready to train an MFA login in the Trainer.
- Providing context when there are many similar elements on the page allows mabl to
  tailor these strategies and create even more resilient find steps.
- Uses email one-time password (OTP) for authentication.
- 'In mabl browser tests, there are three ways to configure additional waits: Configure
  Find, wait until steps, and wait steps.'
- The default timeout for Configure Find steps is 15 seconds, but you may set the
  timeout to wait up to 15 minutes (900 seconds) before finding and interacting with
  the target element.
- 'Custom find steps lack the following features: Auto-heal, Intelligent wait, Triggering
  a download assertion'
- During test execution, mabl only considers elements that match ALL the selected
  Configure Find values before either failing (if auto-heal is disabled) or attempting
  to auto-heal.
- To ensure that the step is not over-constrained, only select the most important
  attributes.
- When finding an element, mabl always uses the latest information from recently found
  versions of that element.
- Providing context when there are many similar elements on the page allows mabl to
  tailor find strategies.
- A confidence rating will be generated based on how many similar elements have been
  found.
- Training in closed shadow DOMs is not supported. Only open shadow DOMs are supported.
- Elements within a shadow DOM tree cannot be targeted with XPath.
- While Configure Find can specify attributes for an element within a shadow DOM,
  it cannot include attributes for the shadow root itself.
- 'Auto-healing in the Shadow DOM: mabl can auto-heal for elements within an element,
  but it cannot auto-heal on the shadow parent itself.'
- The current link crawler does not pierce the shadow DOM. It only captures links
  in the main 'light' DOM.
- On the Test Output page, shadow DOM trees are not included in the HTML shown in
  the DOM tab.
- Assertions have a character limit of 300. If you are trying to assert on an element
  that has more than 300 characters, mabl will capture only up to 300 characters.
- Soft assertions are useful for asserting non-functional aspects, such as element
  labels and style, without stopping the test from executing.
- Cache may affect API responses.
- Ensure proper API permissions for data access.
- If the test passes, the auto-heal is saved.
- If it fails, the auto-heal is not saved.
- All find actions in mabl, including assertions, automatically wait up to 30 seconds
  for the targeted element to appear.
- The 'disable case sensitivity' option may behave unexpectedly for certain characters
  and languages where casing exists and the rules differ significantly from standard
  English.
- Assertions are critical for building effective automated tests that yield meaningful
  results.
- Keep the end goal in mind when writing assertions.
- All find actions in mabl, including URL assertions, will automatically wait up to
  30 seconds for the targeted element to appear.
- If the URL takes more than 30 seconds to appear, a wait step before the assertion
  may be necessary.
- API provides various testing capabilities including browser, performance, and accessibility
  testing.
- You can define variables at an environment level and use them across multiple tests.
- Variable names are case sensitive.
- Use all caps for environment variable names.
- Some API endpoints may have specific requirements on headers or params
- We recommend using cloud credentials and cloud credentials with MFA for sensitive
  data.
- Credentials set at the plan level override credentials set at the test level.
- Mabl credentials are not environment-specific.
- API tests require authentication and proper setup.
- External libraries are not currently supported.
- A common use case for this feature is to define variables for environment-specific
  URLs, API endpoints, and API keys so that you can run the same tests across multiple
  environments such as staging and production.
- When you save environment variables, they are serialized to JSON and encrypted using
  an encryption key specific to your workspace.
- Mablの設定が必要です
- Cloud credentials are only supported on the Unified Runner.
- Test execution will wait up to five minutes for the callback before failing.
- Default timezone variable is an empty string
- Mabl does not currently support download assertions for dynamic file names and partial
  strings in file names.
- Browsers add numbers to repeatedly downloaded files. The download filename assertion
  will automatically elide these numbers during assertions.
- When training in Chrome, you may only automatically download the file 100 times
  due to Chrome limits.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 for API access
- Rate limits are enforced based on your subscription plan
- When you enable parameters in the code editor, adding a description of what a snippet
  does and how to work with its parameters can be helpful for other members of your
  workspace.
- If you're using a variable as an override, be sure that the variable is created
  or initialized before the start of the flow.
- Be careful using the name of a variable already used earlier in the test, as assigning
  a new value to that variable is the same as overwriting the original variable.
- You can only modify the flow parameters when editing the test and flow instance.
- No, you currently cannot loop based on a flow parameter.
- No, only modifying the parameter names and default values will impact other instances
  of the flow.
- Loops can easily be added to any existing reusable flow just by editing it.
- The maximum number of loops allowed is 500.
- When the number of loops is specified with a variable, the mabl runner checks to
  see if the number of loops executed has reached or exceeded the variable value prior
  to each iteration.
- It is possible to extend or break out of looping by modifying the variable conditionally
  from inside the loop.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of connected app in mabl
- Some tests may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup.
- API steps support basic and bearer auth.
- Requires authentication setup for OAuth2
- Email address cannot be user supplied; it must be an input to the test and generated
  by mabl.
- The total size of the email, including attachments, must be under 10 MiB.
- Email must arrive within five minutes of the email assertion step. Otherwise, the
  assertion fails.
- Temporary email addresses do not persist after the test run completes.
- Permanent email addresses persist indefinitely.
- If you're using a variable as an override, be sure that the variable is created
  or initialized before the start of the flow. Otherwise, the step that uses the variable
  will fail.
- You can only modify the flow parameters when editing the test and flow instance.
  We do not currently support the ability to modify the flow parameter while the test
  is running, such as assigning it to a new value in the flow with a 'Create variable'
  step.
- No, you currently cannot loop based on a flow parameter. Loops function similarly
  to flow parameters, however, and it is simple to set a flow to loop based on a variable
  created earlier in the test by using the standard '{{@varName}}' format.
- No, only modifying the parameter names and default values will impact other instances
  of the flow. Modifying the override or inputs will not alter other instances of
  the same flow, even within the same test.
- The mabl Mailbox stores the 100 most recent emails in the inbox.
- The total email size must be less than 10 MiB. Since this includes all email headers
  and metadata, the attachment limit is also under 10 MiB.
- Attachment links expire after 1 hour.
- The 'Record hovers' setting allows automatic recording of hover steps.
- API authentication requires OAuth2 with refresh token.
- Only temporary email addresses support custom email prefixes. Permanent email addresses
  do not support custom email prefixes.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- PDFs that are generated via an HTTP POST request are only supported when encoded
  as 'x-www-form-urlencoded'.
- Due to restrictions in Chrome, blob URL PDFs can be trained against when embedded,
  or downloaded, but not when the blob URL is directly opened, i.e. the location bar
  URL starts with 'blob://'
- The Trainer cannot make assertions against documents that are solely images, such
  as scans.
- There is no support for filling out PDF forms.
- Any request that runs as part of an API test or API step in the cloud counts towards
  the monthly allocated API requests for your workspace.
- Local runs of both API and browser tests, including steps run in the mabl Trainer
  and API Test Editor, do not impact your allotment in any way.
- Your form validations and mail provider should support email addresses up to 25
  characters long.
- The email address cannot be user supplied; it must be an input to the test and generated
  by mabl.
- Cookies essentially customize your web experience.
- Session cookies expire when the browser is closed.
- Permanent cookies remain in operation even after closing the browser.
- Third-party cookies are installed by external parties.
- Permanent workspaces can create up to 100 permanent email addresses.
- Trial workspaces can create up to 20 permanent email addresses.
- The maximum filename limit is 255 ASCII characters.
- If the filename includes non-ASCII characters, the limit may be as low as 84 characters
  depending on character encoding and the 255 bytes available for filenames.
- By default, file uploads are supported up to 15 megabytes.
- Support for large file uploads up to 100 MB is currently available as an early access
  program.
- Attachment links expire after 1 hour. If you keep a mabl Mailbox open during training
  for over an hour, the links will not resolve.
- This feature is available to customers on the Enterprise plan, as well as all mabl
  trials.
- There are some basic limitations when testing PDFs, as they sometimes can be set
  up differently than a standard webpage.
- Cookies essentially customize your web experience!
- Session cookies are primarily used by online shops, and expire when the browser
  is closed.
- Permanent cookies are the kind that remain in operation even after closing the browser.
- There are also third-party cookies, which are installed by external parties.
- 'The mabl Trainer does not support the following methods for opening a new tab:
  CTRL + T or ⌘+T keypress steps, CTRL + click or ⌘+ click.'
- Switch context steps for tabs cannot be edited.
- The mabl Trainer does not support switching context to a new tab whose name or URL
  is dynamically generated.
- Data-driven testing is supported.
- File uploads are supported up to 15 megabytes.
- Automatic popup dismissal cannot be disabled.
- If mabl is dismissing an element that the test should interact with during cloud
  runs, try adding Configure Find to target the correct element.
- Keyboard shortcuts are only supported for applications that use event listeners
  for specific key up or key down events.
- Global keyboard shortcuts, such as ctrl + a, ctrl + c, and ctrl + v, are handled
  at the system level and are not supported in mabl browser tests.
- Both steps are required to create a valid drag and drop action.
- The mabl Trainer does not support click and drag actions.
- Requires OAuth2 setup for authentication
- API responses may vary based on user permissions
- 'Supported special keys include: [ENTER], [TAB], [BACKSPACE], [DELETE], [ARROWUP],
  [ARROWDOWN], [ARROWLEFT], [ARROWRIGHT], and [ ] for space keypress.'
- A DataTable is a table of data that defines what variables a test uses and what
  their values should be in each scenario.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication to access the API.
- The mabl Trainer does not support click and drag actions. Click and drag requires
  an element and an offset, such as coordinates.
- If a drag and drop action interacts with an <svg> element, the mabl Trainer cannot
  with specific coordinates in a <path> element.
- DataTables can have a maximum of 500 scenarios.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 credentials in mabl
- Data-driven testing allows for the clean distinction of test logic from the actual
  test data.
- Data-driven variables are the building blocks of data-driven testing.
- To edit an API test with a DataTable scenario, you need to add the variable names
  from the DataTable and the values from the scenario manually.
- API requires OAuth2 authentication
- DataTables run the same test multiple times with a different scenario with a different
  set of data each time.
- Plans with DataTables and multiple browsers will run tests multiplied by the number
  of browsers configured.
- Currently, CSV is the only supported file format for DataTables.
- The tests details page describes the steps that mabl will follow when testing the
  test and provides informations on Plans that include the tests (if applicable).
- Requires proper API key setup in the mabl dashboard.
- Some endpoints may have usage limits.
- API supports both REST and GraphQL.
- Ensure proper OAuth setup to avoid authentication issues.
- Editing test steps requires the mabl Desktop App.
- Requires setup of connected app in mabl.
- All newly created tests are saved to a master branch, unless specified otherwise.
- API supports RESTful interactions.
- If a plan includes a test that is associated with a DataTable, then by default the
  plan will run the test once for each scenario (row) in all associated DataTables
  by default.
- If a plan is configured to run on multiple browsers and includes tests that are
  associated with DataTables, the plan will run those tests once for each DataTable
  scenario multiplied by the number of browsers configured.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup in mabl
- API has rate limits that may affect data retrieval
- API requires OAuth2 with refresh token flow.
- If the current test has no plans that include it, a new section titled 'Add a plan
  to this test' will replace the 'Plans that include this test' section.
- The compare and conflict resolution views are not available for API tests.
- If either the master or the branch version of a test or flow was saved prior to
  March 27, 2022 there is insufficient information to determine whether it is safe
  to overwrite the master with the branch version.
- If not all conflicts have been resolved and you continue with a merge, the test
  version of conflicting steps and values will overwrite the master version.
- If you delete a test or flow, it will be deleted across all branches.
- Plan labels can be used to define specific test suites, such as regression, targeted
  regression, smoke, the team associated with the tests, or a certain functionality
