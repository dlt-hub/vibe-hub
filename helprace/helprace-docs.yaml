auth_info:
- information_source; https://helprace.com/docs/api/:
  - 'API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with email and password credentials (format:
    `user@example.com:password`), passed via the `-u` flag in requests. Alternatively,
    API keys can be generated and managed in Settings > INTEGRATIONS > API page in
    the admin panel; authentication is required for requests that modify data or access
    restricted content, but public search requests do not require authentication.'
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Credentials are sent as username and password
    in the HTTP Authorization header using the format user@example.com:password, typically
    encoded in base64 for the Authorization: Basic header. In cURL, use the -u flag
    with the format username:password.'
  - Basic authentication is required using email and password credentials passed via
    the `-u` flag (or Authorization header). Credentials are formatted as `user@example.com:password`
    and sent in the HTTP Authorization header using basic auth scheme.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication over HTTPS. You can authenticate either
    with your primary email address and password in the format `{email_address}:{password}`,
    or with your email address and API key in the format `{email_address}/api_key:{api_key}`.
    Pass credentials via the `-u` flag in curl or the Authorization header using base64-encoded
    Basic auth.
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed via the `-u` flag
    in curl, which translates to an `Authorization` header with base64-encoded `username:password`
    in the format `Authorization: Basic base64(user@example.com:password)`. The same
    credentials apply to all request types (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://helprace.com/docs/api/:
  - 'API responses returning lists include a meta object with pagination details:
    count (total records), page (current page number), pages (total pages), and per_page
    (records per page). Request pagination using the per_page query parameter to override
    the default of 10 records per page. Navigate pages by incrementing the page parameter
    in subsequent requests until page equals pages.'
  - Default page size is 10 records; override with per_page query parameter. Navigate
    pages using Link header with rel="first", rel="next", and rel="last" URLs.
  - Page and per_page are query parameters for pagination. page is the page number
    to retrieve, and per_page specifies records per page with a default of 10. The
    response structure uses a data array within users to return paginated results,
    but no explicit next/previous fields or stop condition are documented.
  - Page-based pagination using page (integer, page number) and per_page (integer,
    records per page, default 10) query parameters. The response structure for indicating
    total pages or next page is not specified in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: request with query parameters page (optional,
    default 1) and per_page (optional, default 10); response includes meta object
    with count (total results), page (current page number), pages (total page count),
    and per_page (results per page). Stop when page reaches pages value.'
