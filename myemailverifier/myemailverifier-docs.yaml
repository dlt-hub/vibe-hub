  - API key authentication is required, passed as a URL path parameter named API_KEY.
    The API key can be obtained from the client area API section. Missing or invalid
    API keys will result in error responses indicating "Missing API Key" or "Invalid
    API Key". Account status, payment verification, and credit availability are also
    checked during authentication.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as the final path segment
    in the GET request URL to the validate_single endpoint. The API key can be found
    in the client area API section at https://client.myemailverifier.com/apisettings.
  - Authentication requires an API key that must be included in request URLs as a
    path parameter named API_KEY. The API key is acquired by users and serves to authenticate
    every API call. If the API key is missing or invalid, the API returns a response
    with status false and either "Unauthorized Request" or "Invalid API Key" message.
