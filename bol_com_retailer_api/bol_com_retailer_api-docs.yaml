  - 'HTTP Basic authentication is required, using base64-encoded ClientId and ClientSecret
    concatenated with a colon. Send a POST request to https://login.bol.com/token
    with grant_type=client_credentials in the body and Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    header. The response contains an access_token field with a Bearer token that must
    be extracted and used in subsequent API requests; the token expires in 299 seconds
    as indicated by expires_in.'
  - 'JWT token-based authentication. Acquire a JWT token via a prior authentication
    step, then pass it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" when calling
    the Retailer API. The token is embedded with expiration information and should
    be reused across multiple requests rather than requesting a new token per request.
    Set the Authorization header with value "Bearer <token>" and include Accept: application/json
    header.'
  - 'JWT tokens are used for authentication by including them in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The token format is `Authorization: Bearer [jwt]`, where
    the JWT is a signed token that cannot be modified without invalidation. Tokens
    can be introspected for debugging but are read-only; modification will cause signature
    mismatch and request rejection.'
- information_source; https://api.bol.com/retailer/public/Retailer-API/intermediary-authorization.html:
  - 'The bol Retailer API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Send the access
    token in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Tokens
    expire and are refreshed; use the new refresh token provided with each token response.'
- information_source; https://api.bol.com/retailer/public/Retailer-API/conventions.html:
  - The Retailer API uses OAuth2 for authentication. Retrieve a token from an OAuth2
    server, then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for all
    authenticated requests. Omitting this header will result in a 403 Forbidden response.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.bol.com/advertiser/docs/redoc/sponsored-products/v11/campaign-management.html:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter page (integer, >= 1, default 1) to request
    specific pages. Response includes page field indicating current page number. Continue
    paginating by incrementing page parameter until no more results are returned.
  - Pagination uses page and pageSize parameters in the request body. page is the
    page number (starting at 1) and pageSize is the number of results per page. The
    response contains an ads array with the paginated results, but does not include
    fields indicating total pages, has_more, or next page information.
  - 'The pagination parameters are passed in the request body: page (required, integer
    starting at 1) and pageSize (required, integer for results per page). The response
    does not include pagination metadata or navigation fields; only the adGroups array
    is returned.'
- information_source; https://api.bol.com/advertiser/docs/redoc/sponsored-products/v11/budget-management.html:
  - Pagination is controlled by page (required, starts at 1) and pageSize (required)
    parameters in the request body. The response contains a campaignBudgets array
    but does not indicate total pages, next page markers, or stopping conditions,
    so pagination navigation rules are unclear from this documentation.
- ? information_source; https://api.bol.com/retailer/public/Retailer-API/v11/functional/advertising-api/campaign-management/campaigns.html
  : - Pagination uses `page` and `pageSize` parameters in the request body. The `page`
      parameter specifies which page to retrieve, and `pageSize` specifies the number
      of results per page, with a maximum limit of 50 for `pageSize`. The response
      returns a `campaigns` array containing the paginated results.
