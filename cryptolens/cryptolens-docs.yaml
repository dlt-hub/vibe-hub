  - The access token is passed as a query parameter named `token` in the URL. The
    token must have the appropriate permissions for the API method being called (e.g.,
    "Activate" permission for the Activate endpoint), and an "Unable to authenticate"
    error indicates either an incorrect token or an expired subscription.

  - Access tokens are required and passed as a query parameter named `token`. The
    token must have the appropriate permissions for the specific API method being
    called (e.g., "GetKey" permission for the GetKey method). An "Unable to authenticate"
    error indicates an invalid token or expired subscription, while "Access denied"
    means the token lacks sufficient permissions for the requested operation.

  - 'The Cryptolens Web API requires an access token with either UserAuthNormal or
    UserAuthAdmin permission passed to the Login method. The Login method accepts
    username and password credentials and returns licenses associated with the authenticated
    user.


    Access token requirement: pass the token as the first parameter to UserAuth.Login()
    method. For production use in applications, assign the access token UserAuthNormal
    permission only. The Login method signature is UserAuth.Login(access_token, LoginUserModel
    with UserName and Password fields).'
