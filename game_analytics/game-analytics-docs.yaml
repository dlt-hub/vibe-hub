notes:
- The collector has a POST size limit of 1MB in the request body.
- The servers validate fields and reject events that do not pass validation.
- Make sure your character encoding is UTF-8 for strings.
- Certain event_id strings require specific characters validated by matching a regex.
- Users are reporting issues with failing authentication using the UTF-8 standard
  in Java. In this case make sure you encode to the ISO-8859-1 standard instead.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Starting with iOS 14.5, apps must ask for user consent before they can access and
  share some user data, including the device's IDFA.
- Remember to add a usage-description to the info.plist file.
- Uses GameAnalytics SDK for event tracking.
- Remember to request app permission after Android 6.0.
- A maximum of 20 values are allowed for each list
- The SDK still expects to be run in a browser environment where the navigator object
  is defined.
- By default event submission is enabled.
- Don’t have any keys yet? Head over here and register your game at the GameAnalytics
  website!
- 'There are three custom dimensions available to send: custom_01, custom_02 and custom_03.'
- When a Custom Dimension is set for the user it will be persisted across sessions
  and app exit until another custom dimension value is specified, the dimension value
  is reset by calling with null, or the app is re-installed.
- Our event collection system allows up to 100 unique custom dimensions values for
  each custom dimension category.
- When data collection is limited or disabled, the events cannot be recovered.
- GameAnalytics calculate metrics within UTC dates/hours.
- Primary Owners cannot be removed from the Organization without contacting support.
- This SLA does not apply to any free Services, Accounts or subscriptions (“Core Analytics”)
  offered by GameAnalytics.
- GameAnalytics Pro includes GameAnalytics Platform, Metrics API and Organization
  API.
- GameAnalytics DataSuite includes Data Export and Data Warehouse.
- Data will be processed and delivered to You by the beginning of the following UTC
  day (within 12 hours after midnight UTC).
- The project has to be a C++ project for the plugin to work! A pure blueprint project
  won't work.
- Enable HTTP requests in Roblox Studio to send events.
- Your game must ship with the executable and the the shared library to function.
- Lack of the DLL/SO/DyLib (for your respective OS) will cause it to fail and crash.
- Do not use a custom userId unless you have a specific need for using it.
- Processing many unique dimension values can be taxing for our servers.
- From v1.8.0 and onwards the jsbindings have been updated to work with the latest
  API.
- The Gamemaker Studio 2 download link can only seen on the marketplace page by users
  with a paid Gamemaker Studio 2 license.
- Each resource currency string should only contain [A-Za-z] characters.
- Configuration calls configure settings for the SDK and some will not be able to
  be altered after initialize has been called.
- The configuration and initialization steps should be called when the application
  starts.
- Configuration and initialization steps should be called when the application starts.
- Custom userId should only be used if necessary to avoid affecting user metrics.
- The GameAnalytics .ane file is around 40MB.
- Including this and other extensions in your app increases the number of method references
  that must be stored in Android dex file.
- Requires setup of game keys for different platforms.
- Remember you need to restart Construct before you can start using the GameAnalytics
  plugin.
- GameAnalytics Constructor plugin doesn’t work in 'Worker Mode'.
- Remember to set the game key and secret key for your game in Properties section
  on the GameAnalytics object.
- Requires configuration of game.project file for SDK setup
- 'In order to read IMEI and MEID values, add the following line under the gameanalytics
  section to your game.project file: [gameanalytics]  use_imei_android = 1.'
- The GameAnalytics iOS SDK uses IDFV as the user id and it will only add IDFA to
  events if IDFA consent status is authorized.
- The GameAnalytics tvOS SDK uses IDFV as the user id and it will only add IDFA to
  events if IDFA consent status is authorized.
- The GameAnalytics C++ SDK code is open-source.
- Remember to include the GameAnalytics header file wherever you are using the SDK.
- The SDK is open-source and can be built to multiple platforms.
- Only HTTPS is supported.
- Data is submitted and received as JSON strings.
- Gzip is supported and strongly recommended.
- GameAnalytics will not store the IP on our servers.
- If all the events are submitted by a single server then the country for all users
  would be the same.
- It is needed to submit a request per user and specify the IP.
- Uses HMAC Authorization for secure API access
- The user event should always be the first event in the first batch sent to the collectors.
- Do not send more than 10 error events per game launch.
- The error event supports large stack traces and therefore these events have a limitation;
  custom dimension and progression filters will not work on error events.
- Use only custom dimensions if the need is for filtering all other data.
- Don’t use all 3 straight away unless you are certain of how to use it.
- Collector has a POST size limit of 1MB in the request body.
- Authorization could not be verified if the game keys are not correct or the implementation
  is not done properly for calculating the HMAC hash for the Authentication header.
- If a player purchase coins with real-money, send both a Business event and a Resource
  event (source) to track the economy flow.
- These events must be manually implemented.
- Design events must be manually implemented.
- Uses HMAC for authorization with secret key
- Gzip compression can be enabled for event submissions
- Sandbox API URLs. Change with live end-point when ready.
- GameAnalytics encourages flexible event tracking but enforces limits to maintain
  system reliability and performance.
- If event tracking limits are exceeded, GameAnalytics will alert you via the Game
  Overview → Integrations page.
- Batch or aggregate frequent actions to combine similar events into single summaries
  per session.
- Aim for structured, reusable event parameters and avoid using dynamic values like
  user IDs, timestamps or coordinates.
- Test your SDK integration early to confirm event volumes and structure are within
  limits.
- Monitor your thresholds using the Game Overview → Integration page to track daily
  events and cardinality.
- Utilize the value field for any dynamic data, e.g. time, damage, scores.
- Custom event fields are not displayed in the AnalyticsIQ web-tool.
- You can access and analyze them exclusively through PipelineIQ’s Data Warehouse
  and Data Export features.
- External User IDs are optional, and not used in the AnalyticsIQ UI for calculating
  metrics.
- 'Persistent identity is your responsibility: Ensure that your game reliably provides
  the same ID per player (e.g. from a login system).'
- 'GDPR compliance: If you use External User IDs that could identify users personally,
  ensure that you handle privacy and consent appropriately.'
- Data Warehouse provides direct access to your data via Google BigQuery.
