notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The permissions and license of the user logging into the REST API will affect what
  is allowed.
- The ID of items within the requests must be specified without leading zeros.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects like Test Case may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Certain special characters are not allowed in the username: @, ", /, =, ?, [, ],
  , +, *, :, ;, >, <, and |.'
- Users without an assigned license will not be able to access aqua.
- When a user's assigned license expires, the user is automatically deactivated.
- The option 'Permissions from Licence' allows you to define a role based on a specific
  licence, if required.
- If you are SaaS or Private Cloud customer you will have only one type of the license
  which is 'aqua cloud' license, which has got all of the permissions according to
  the set up of the ALM license type.
- Requires authentication to access resources.
- Requires setup of an OAuth 2.0 application in Jira.
- Rate limits may apply based on the account type.

- You can re-enable it at any time.
- In the workflow configuration, only status transitions and restrictions can be configured.
- Limitations for fields can be defined based on user roles.
- You cannot modify the configurations directly in a shared project. All changes must
  be made in the source (master) project.

- 'For users in a SaaS environment: Please note that the report script can only be
  managed from the desktop client.'
- Diagrams are charts which are based on the data available in the report.
- Beware that even if a graph is placed in a band, the data used in that graph is
  taken from the whole report.
- Make sure to unmark the field *Show data headers* in the Options -> View Options
- Allow mapping of only selected values and ignore other field values for the sync
- Automatic creation and mapping of field values

- Allows you to perform a simple count of the number of items without having to use
  scripts.
- Supports sync of projects between aqua and Jira
- In aqua reports, you have the flexibility to iterate through various elements.
- There might be scenarios where all requirements need to be iterated, resulting in
  a report header and a list of all requirements.
- However, there could be exceptional cases where no requirements should be displayed
  in the reports.
- In such instances, you may want to hide these elements.
- OAuth2 setup requires registration of an application in Jira.
- Ensure correct scopes are assigned for API access.
- Creating a test execution report in aqua cloud that allows filtering based on custom
  fields can greatly enhance your test analysis.
- Creating a new dashboard involves entering a name and selecting the size of the
  dashboard.
- KPI Alerts are very useful for improving the overview of your project.
- To customize the appearance of your KPI alert, choose the colour you want the bar
  or pie to have when the expression is true.
- When grouping by the status of the last test case execution, the expected colours
  are automatically applied.
- Requires a valid Atlassian account and proper permissions to access data.
- Once you set the start and end dates, the system automatically calculates the sprint's
  length, allowing you to see immediately if the selected dates are correct for 1-week,
  2-week, etc., sprints.
- To properly display 'burned' points, ensure the default 'Points' field is added
  if it hasn't been enabled for the item yet on the template page.
- Once all settings are configured, navigate to the dashboard and click 'New Chart.'
  Then select 'Template' and choose the 'Burndown' chart.
- It is important to note that when grouping by the status of the last test case execution,
  the expected colours are automatically applied. For example, green for passed, red
  for failed, and so on.

- Integration with Jira requires proper OAuth configuration.
- In order to enable a connection via SSL between aqua Rich Client and aqua Server,
  the aqua Server requires some additional configuration and an appropriate SSL-certificate.

- Key steps for synchronization are outlined in the documentation.
- It can process only 1-page PDF files.
- It can generate only one document at a time.
- Some fields may have compatibility issues between Aqua and Jira
- To enable synchronization, matching email addresses are required in both systems
  when using the 'Assigned to' field.
- For synchronization, the username in aqua must match the username and display name
  in Azure.
- Project-level configuration takes precedence over the global configuration.
- Users won't have the ability to preview or link issues or tickets to aqua projects
  while it’s disabled.
- Currently, this integration supports only Confluence Cloud pages.
- Support for Confluence Data Center is planned for an upcoming release.
- The new version of extension is compatible with aqua version 22.123 and higher.

  field.
- If the 'Assigned to' field is not used, user matching is not necessary.
- The sync runs automatically every 10 seconds.
- Some API features may require additional permissions.
- Ensure to set up OAuth2 for accessing the API
- API usage may be limited based on subscription tier
- We recommend enforcing HTTPS for all communications. Although both HTTP and/or HTTPS
  links can be configured based on customer deployment, HTTPS should be prioritized.
- Ensure proper configuration of OAuth2 for access
- The process of starting the execution and recording is simplified. The test execution
  page will be completely transferred to the extension while opening the test environment.
- Ensure API key is valid and has necessary permissions.
- Some fields may not be compatible between aqua and Jira.
- Requires setup of OAuth in Atlassian developer console
- Rate limits apply to API calls

- Data is saved to Capture only when you create a ticket by saving it to the Capture
  dashboard.

  content in the visual output.
- We recommend using the blurring feature only when you are capturing video for sharing
  purposes.
- Requires setup of Atlassian application links for OAuth
- Rate limits may apply depending on usage levels
- Currently recording of the screen while you performing the test run with aqua test
  case in the sidebar is not available.Will be added with next release.
