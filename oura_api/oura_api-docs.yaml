  - 'API supports two authentication methods: Bearer token authentication via the
    Authorization header, and OAuth2. For Bearer token auth, include the header "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" with your access token. The 401 response indicates an expired,
    malformed, or revoked access token, and the 403 response indicates an expired
    subscription.'
  - 'Access to the Oura API requires Bearer token authentication. Include the access
    token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>". OAuth2 is
    also supported as an alternative authentication method. A 401 status code indicates
    the access token is expired, malformed, or revoked. A 403 status code indicates
    the user''s Oura subscription has expired and their data is unavailable via the
    API.'
  - 'Authentication requires two headers: x-client-id and x-client-secret. Both must
    be provided in the request headers for all webhook subscription operations.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" where <token> is your actual access
    token obtained from Oura.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Two auth
    schemes are supported: BearerAuth and OAuth2. Include the token as `Authorization:
    Bearer <token>` in request headers. Unauthorized (401) responses indicate expired,
    malformed, or revoked access tokens; Forbidden (403) responses indicate expired
    Oura subscription.'
