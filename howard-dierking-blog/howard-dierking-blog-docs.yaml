notes:
- The podcast is available through all the regular channels!
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- It worked out better for us to manage cache settings through Akamai rather than
  to have Akamai follow the origin’s HTTP cache policy headers.
- Don’t use dots in the S3 bucket name if you’re going to use SSL.
- Not using S3’s static Website feature means that you don’t get its default page
  handling feature for free.
- Since your edge certificate will match your custom domain name for its CN, you need
  to pin the AWS wildcard certificate in Akamai’s Origin Server behavior.
- Metalsmith is a static site generator with a plugin-based architecture.
- Metalsmith is a simple and flexible static site generator.
