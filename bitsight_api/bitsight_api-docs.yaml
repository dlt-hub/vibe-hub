    username in the auth parameter and set the password to an empty string when making
    requests with the requests library.
  - 'API tokens are used for authentication via HTTP Basic Auth. Generate a token
    in the User Preferences page under Company API Token section. In Python requests
    library, pass the token as the username with an empty password using the auth
    parameter: auth=(''api_token'', ''''). The token is displayed only once and must
    be kept secure.'

  - BitSight API uses API token authentication. Include your API token in the request
    using HTTP Basic Authentication format with the token as the username and an empty
    password (e.g., `-u [api_token]:`). The token is passed in the Authorization header
    following standard Basic Auth encoding.
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Access Authentication. Pass your API token as the username
    with an empty password (or a colon after the token) in the Authorization header.
    In Python, use the requests library with the auth parameter: requests.get(url,
    auth=(api_token, '''')).'
  - The Bitsight API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API token. Include the
    API token in the request using the `-u [api_token]:` parameter (curl syntax) or
    by setting the Authorization header to "Basic base64(api_token:)" in your HTTP
    client. The API token must be obtained from the Bitsight API Token Management
    system.
