auth_info:
- information_source; https://nabgateway-developer.nab.com.au/api-reference-assets/index.html:
  - API login and API key are required to authenticate requests. Send the API login
    and API key as credentials to authenticate against the sandbox and production
    endpoints. The reference guide indicates these credentials can be used directly
    in request examples provided in the documentation, though specific header or parameter
    names are not detailed in this excerpt.
  - 'Two authentication methods are available: JSON Web Token (JWT) requiring a P12
    Certificate signature, or HTTP Signature using a shared secret key. Authorization
    headers are generated based on the request payload for each method.


    Required credentials for sandbox include Organization ID, Key, and Shared Secret
    Key. HTTP Signature authentication requires these headers for every API request,
    with authorization headers computed per request using the shared secret.'
- information_source; https://nabgateway-developer.nab.com.au/api/webhooks.html:
  - Authenticate with REST API Keys. After sandbox account creation, you receive a
    set of keys that must be saved. Use these keys to authenticate with the REST API,
    accessing them via the NAB Business Center after establishing your username and
    password.
  - REST API authentication uses Organization ID, Key, and Shared Secret Key credentials.
    These credentials are input into the Developer Center API Reference Assets interface
    or can be generated via Business Center Key management. For webhook notifications,
    an additional digital signature key must be generated via the Create Webhook Security
    Keys POST endpoint and securely stored for validating webhook payload integrity
    and preventing replay attacks.
