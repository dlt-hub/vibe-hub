auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.meridianapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039669834-Using-the-Maps-API:
  - All of the following API requests will need to use token authentication. Get a
    valid personal or application token by logging into the Editor, navigating to
    the Application Tokens tab, clicking Add, providing a name, and clicking Generate
    Token. Send the token in API requests to authenticate. The documentation does
    not specify the exact header name or parameter name where the token should be
    sent.
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Token" followed by a space and your API token (e.g., "Token 5b1a4ba3e21147f9064d9278dca729d97141bb45").
    Send this header with all requests to authenticate.
  - 'Token-based authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Token {token_value}" where the token value is a string like
    "5b1a4ba3e21147f9064d9278dca729d97141bb45".'
  - 'Token-based authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Token {token_value}", where the token is a 40-character hexadecimal
    string (e.g., "5b1a4ba3e21147f9064d9278dca729d97141bb45").'
  - Upon receiving successful login credentials, the login API returns a token value.
    This token is used for authentication by including it in the Authorization header
    with the format "Token {token_value}". The token remains valid until deleted or
    a logout request is received. Token permissions are controlled through a Permission
    Type (Organization or Location), access Level (Owner for read/write or Read-Only),
    and can be generated with a meaningful name through the application interface.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.meridianapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039670174-REST-API:
  - Paginated list endpoints return responses with next and previous fields containing
    URLs for navigation. Most paginated lists return 100 items per page by default.
    To paginate, use the next URL from the response to fetch the subsequent page,
    and previous for the prior page.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with response fields next, previous, and
    results. To paginate, make requests to the URL provided in the next field from
    the previous response; continue fetching until next is null, indicating the final
    page.
