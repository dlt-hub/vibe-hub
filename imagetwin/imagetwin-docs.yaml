auth_info:
- information_source; https://imagetwin.ai/docs/api:
  - API key authentication is required as a bearer token in the Authorization header.
    The 401 Unauthorized status code indicates invalid or missing API key credentials.
  - Access to the API requires authentication through a distinctive API key generated
    at app.imagetwin.ai/account. The API key must be sent as a bearer token in the
    Authorization header of requests. Per user, only one API key can be active at
    a time; generating a new key invalidates the previous one.
  - Authentication uses a bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The API
    key must be included as "Authorization Bearer" in the request headers for endpoints
    like POST /v1/scanImages.
  - 'Authorization Bearer token must be included in the Authorization header. The
    API key is passed as a Bearer token in the format "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}".'
  - 'Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    Send the API key as Authorization: Bearer API_Key in the request headers.'
