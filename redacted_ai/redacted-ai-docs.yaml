- Payload for inspection and redaction is detailed in the documentation.
- Minimum confidence for detected entities is customizable.
- Assisted Redaction Only — requires specific configuration for redaction types
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in redacted.ai
- Some endpoints may return pagination links
