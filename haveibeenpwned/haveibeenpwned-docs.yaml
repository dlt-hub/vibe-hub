auth_info:
- information_source; https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3:
  - API key authentication is required, passed as the "hibp-api-key" header in requests.
    The key must be obtained from the HIBP website and included in each API call to
    authenticate.
  - API key authentication is required. Include the header hibp-api-key with your
    API key value in all requests to the stealer logs endpoints. The domain being
    searched must be pre-registered in the domain search dashboard.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your HIBP API key in the request header
    named `hibp-api-key` with the value of your key. This applies to endpoints for
    stealer logs by email domain and paste account searches.
  - An HIBP subscription API key is required for authorization. The key is passed
    in the "hibp-api-key" header as a 32-character hexadecimal string. Test keys can
    use any properly formatted value (e.g., "00000000000000000000000000000000"). Keys
    are validated on each request; missing, malformed, or invalid keys return 401
    Unauthorised responses.
  - Authorization is required for account/domain/email search APIs using an HIBP subscription
    key. Send the key in the `hibp-api-key` header with each request. The Pwned Passwords
    API requires no authorization.
