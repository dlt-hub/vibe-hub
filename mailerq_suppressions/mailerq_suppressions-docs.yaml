    \ For the request format, see\nthe table below. All fields are optional.\n\n|\

    \ note that not all fields may be passed at the same time. `pool` and `mta` are\
    \ mutually exclusive.\nThat means that they may not be supplied together, or they\
    \ will result in a `400` response.\n\nFor example, the request below will install\
    \ a Forced Error with code `421` to `hotmail.com` for a single campaign.\n\n```\n\
    \nPOST /v1/errors HTTP/1.0\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Bearer\

    \ /v1/errors HTTP/1.0\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAuthorization:\

    \nA DELETE request allows you to\n\nThis API uses Bearer token authentication.\

    \ Include the header Authorization: Bearer ... in all requests to authenticate."
  - 'All API requests require Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ...". Both POST and DELETE requests support this
    header-based authentication method alongside JSON and URL-encoded request bodies.'
  - 'Authentication to the MailerQ REST API v1 uses bearer tokens passed in the Authorization
    header. Tokens are created in the management console at Settings > REST API and
    inserted into each request as Authorization: Bearer <token>. Currently, all tokens
    have full access to the complete API.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header Authorization: Bearer <token> in all requests to the /v1/externalmtas
    endpoint.'
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" for all requests to the suppressions and related endpoints.
