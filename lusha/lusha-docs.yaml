auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/apis/openapi/section/notes-on-api-rate-limiting:
  - The API KEY header is mandatory for every request to our service. Include the
    API key in the Authorization header or as an X-API-Key header with each request
    to authenticate.
  - To access the Lusha API, include your API key in the `api_key` header of each
    request. The API key is unique to your account and obtained from https://dashboard.lusha.com/enrich/api.
    Keep the key private and protected from unauthorized access as it tracks your
    API usage.

  - 'Lusha API uses API key authentication passed as a request header. Include the
    api_key header with your API key value in all requests to authenticate, for example:
    -H "api_key: YOUR_API_KEY"'
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/guides:
  - Lusha API uses Bearer token authentication. Generate an API key in the Lusha dashboard
    and include it in the Authorization header as `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` with each
    request. Store the key securely using environment variables.
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/apis/openapi:
  - Lusha's Prospecting API requires an API KEY header for every request. The API
    KEY must be included in the request headers to authenticate all calls to the service.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/guides:
  - 'Pagination is defined by including a `page: X` token in the request body. The
    documentation does not specify response fields indicating pagination state, how
    to determine when to stop paginating, or maximum page values.'
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/guides.md:
  - 'Pagination uses a `page` token defined in the request. The documentation mentions
    defining `page: X` in the request but does not specify response fields, stopping
    conditions, or whether the parameter is query/body/path-based.'
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/apis/openapi/contact-search-and-enrich:
  - Use the pages object in the request body with page (starting at 0) and size (number
    of results per page) parameters to paginate results. The response indicates pagination
    state through a pages object containing page, size, and total fields to determine
    available pages.
- information_source; https://docs.lusha.com/apis/openapi/company-search-and-enrich:
  - Pagination is controlled via a `pages` object in the request body containing `page`
    (zero-indexed page number) and `size` (number of results per page, default 20).
    The response includes pagination metadata to indicate whether additional pages
    are available.
  - Pagination uses a `pages` object (PaginationParams) in the request body. The response
    structure and specific pagination fields are not detailed in the provided excerpt,
    so complete pagination mechanics cannot be determined from this documentation
    chunk alone.
