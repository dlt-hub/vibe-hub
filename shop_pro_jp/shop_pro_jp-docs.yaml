- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/shop-pro.jp/1.0.0/openapi.json:
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. The flow involves obtaining an authorization
    code from the OAuth endpoint, exchanging it for an access token, and including
    the access token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent
    API requests.
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. Tokens are obtained from https://api.shop-pro.jp/oauth/token.
    The API uses OAuth2 with various scopes for different operations including reading
    and writing script tags, application charges, and shop data.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Send the user to https://api.shop-pro.jp/oauth/authorize
    with query parameters client_id (your app's client ID), redirect_uri (your callback
    URL), response_type set to "code", and scope as a space-separated list of permissions
    such as read_products, write_products, and write_application_charge. The authorization
    server will redirect back to your redirect_uri with an authorization code that
    you exchange for an access token.
  - OAuth2 with authorization code flow is required. Authorization endpoint is https://api.shop-pro.jp/oauth/authorize.

    scopes include read_inline_script_tags, read_script_tags, read_shop_script_tags,

    should be sent in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens for subsequent API
    requests.
