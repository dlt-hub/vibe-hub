auth_info:
- information_source; https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/powered-by-airbyte:
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" (e.g., "Bearer 12345"). The token must be provided
    with each request to the API.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer 12345" (or your actual token value). The header name is "authorization"
    and it must be included in all requests to the Airbyte API.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}", where the token value is passed to the bearer_auth parameter
    (e.g., "Bearer 12345").
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as 'Bearer <token>', where the token value is provided (example shows 'Bearer
    12345'). No other auth mechanisms are described.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header ''authorization: Bearer <token>'' where <token> is your API
    credential. The token value should be provided as ''12345'' in the example, but
    replace with your actual bearer token when making requests.'
