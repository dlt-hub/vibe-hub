- Bearer token expires after 1 hour
- Welcome to 1Shot API!
- 1Shot API’s wallet infrastructure keeps your keys secure and encrypted at rest.
- It is still good practice to only deposit the amount of gas tokens you need for
  a given period of time.
- 1Shot API managed wallets require gas tokens for transaction submissions.
- Delegation allows using self-custodied wallets with 1Shot API automation.
- Webhooks are an optional configuration for your transaction endpoints but are highly
  recommended as they provide immediate feedback to your application once a transaction
  has been confirmed on the blockchain network.
- Before you can configure endpoints to call contract methods, you’ll need to provision
  and fund a wallet.
- Only primitive types are supported for static parameters.
- You can mix and match the 1Shot API triggers, actions, and queries with any other
  IFTTT service.
