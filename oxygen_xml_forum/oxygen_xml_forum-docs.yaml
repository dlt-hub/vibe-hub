  directory, but the working directory changes a lot.

  answers on any post.
- Uses @outputclass="wh-tabbed" attribute to display code examples in tabs.
- Documentation on extending DITA elements is sparse.
- Menus are not clickable after transformation.
- Search function works but displays tasks on a plain page without the template layout.
- 'Fatal error during transformation: XPath expression containing ''101'' operators
  that exceeds the ''100'' limit set.'
