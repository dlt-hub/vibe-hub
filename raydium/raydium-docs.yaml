notes:
- Don’t forget to fund your wallet with SOL, as it is required to execute a transaction
  on the Solana network.
- It is recommended to keep a minimum of 0.05 SOL in your wallet to avoid failed transactions.
- Always verify the URL of the website you are interacting with before connecting
  your wallet.
- Always verify the transaction you are signing.
- Do your own research.
- 'Verify the token address: Ticker and Logo are set freely by token creators, the
  token mint is the true identity of a token.'
- Read the documentation before interacting with smart contracts.
- Pay attention to warnings.
- Raydium allows users to provide liquidity and earn transaction fees from swaps within
  the pool.
- Pay close attention to Price Impact and remember to check 'Minimum Received' when
  executing large swaps or when swapping in a low liquidity pool.
- If you see the **TimeOut** error, it means that the transaction hasn't reached the
  chain.
- Users must connect their wallet to earn referral fees.
- Referral links are compatible with Blinks on X.com.
- Raydium trade API is the fastest and easiest way to interact with Raydium liquidity.
- You need to account for decimals (x10^n) when specifying amounts.
- Raydium Perps is not available to residents of the United States of America, Afghanistan,
  Belarus, the Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of Congo, the Democratic
  People's Republic of Korea, the Crimea, Donetsk People’s Republic, and Luhansk People’s
  Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria,
  Yemen, Zimbabwe and any other jurisdiction in which accessing or using the Raydium
  Protocol is prohibited.
- Impermanent loss can be significant in CLMM pools. A positive return is not guaranteed!
- If an NFT is lost, sold, or burnt, the liquidity it represents will also be lost.
- APRs displayed on Raydium are extrapolations of the pool and farm yield based on
  the daily, weekly, or monthly performance.
- Liquidity providers earn transaction fees from swaps within the pool.
- CLMM pools should be live on the UI approx 5 minutes after creation.
- Gas fees will be higher than usual due to the initialization transaction.
- Permissionless pools allow anyone to create a liquidity pool on Raydium.
- For SPL tokens, pool creation requires freeze authority disabled.
- It is impossible to close a pool once created. None of the fees mentioned above
  are refundable, except for those marked with *.
- Always double-check the RAY mint address before interacting!
- 'RAY Solana SPL address: 4k3Dyjzvzp8eMZWUXbBCjEvwSkkk59S5iCNLY3QrkX6R'
- All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability
  can be exploited to impact an asset-in-scope to be eligible for a reward.
- Critical and High severity bug reports should also include a suggestion for a fix.
- Users will have to manually enter the mint address in the search bar to locate a
  tradable asset.
- Token-2022 assets will not display a token name or logo unless manually added by
  a user.
- Transfer fees may apply to token interactions like swaps or even adding and removing
  liquidity.
- Every new LP must be linked to a unique OpenBook market ID.
- Pool creation requires the base token to have freeze authority disabled.
- After confirming and initializing the pool, you can no longer edit starting price,
  liquidity or start time.
- Rewards allocated to farms are final and cannot be withdrawn once the farm is created.
- Farms generally appear on the UI approx 5 minutes after creation.
- Standard AMM pools incur a trading fee of 0.25%.
- CP-Swap pools have trading fees of 4%, 2%, 1%, and 0.25%.
- CLMM pools have trading fees of 2%, 1%, 0.25%, 0.05%, 0.04%, 0.03%, 0.02%, and 0.01%.
- Standard AMM and CP-swap pool creation incur a fee of 0.15 SOL.
- 12% of all trading fees go to buying back RAY regardless of a given pool's fee tier.
- Fees collected are transferred to specific addresses to buy RAY.
- Fees collected are transferred to specified addresses and used to buy RAY.
errors:
- 'TimeOut: The transaction hasn''t reached the chain.'
- 'Pool already created error: A pool already exists for this token pair.'
- 'Token verify error / Freeze authority enables: This error means that your token
  has freeze authority enabled.'
- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage
- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done
  on private testnets
- Transfer fees may apply to token interactions.
- Token-2022 assets with certain extensions are currently unable to create a permissionless
  pool.
