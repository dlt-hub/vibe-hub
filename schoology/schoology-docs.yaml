auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.schoology.com/app-platform:
  - OAuth header is required in the Authorization header for requests to the /v1/app-user-info
    endpoint. The exact OAuth header format is not specified in this documentation
    excerpt, but it must be included as the Authorization header value when making
    GET requests to https://api.schoology.com/v1/app-user-info.
  - OAuth2 is used for user authorization. Access tokens obtained during the OAuth
    handshake should be saved and reused to avoid repeating the handshake. To verify
    an active user session, retrieve saved access tokens from your database and call
    the Schoology endpoint https://api.schoology.com/v1/app-user-info. For detailed
    information on generating authorization headers, see the API authentication page.

  - OAuth header required in Authorization header for GET requests to https://api.schoology.com/v1/app-user-info.
    The exact OAuth header format is not specified in this documentation excerpt,
    but the endpoint expects an Authorization header containing OAuth credentials
    established during SAML login.
  - OAuth2 is used for authentication. Access tokens are obtained through an OAuth
    handshake and can be saved in a database for reuse on subsequent requests. To
    verify an active session, retrieve saved access tokens and make a request to the
    https://api.schoology.com/v1/app-user-info endpoint. For SSO authentication, parse
    the SAML packet to extract user information and store it in the session, then
    use the saved OAuth access tokens to check for an active Schoology web session
    on each page request.
- information_source; https://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/design-architecture/:
  - The Schoology API uses OAuth-based authentication. The Authorization HTTP header
    must contain a properly generated OAuth header to validate the request as from
    an enabled API user. Credentials are generated by signing into your Schoology
    account and visiting https://www.schoology.com/api. The Authorization header is
    required for all API requests along with standard HTTP headers (Accept, Host,
    Content-Type).
