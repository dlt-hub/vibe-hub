- Important account tokens aren't stored or shared outside of the Scratch website.
- We do not track who is using the extension.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching the sound
  editor API. Do not reference their code when using the API for reasons other than
  compatability.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching the virtual
  machine.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching Blockly.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching the GUI.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching the paint
  editor API.
- Many or all of the features listed use the deprecated API for reaching the sound
  editor API.
- If the value is `undefined`, it's because the user has not set it.
- Features must be dynamic for the `changed` listener to work.
- This API returns the state for the Scratch website. It only works on Scratch 3.0
  pages, where React is used.
