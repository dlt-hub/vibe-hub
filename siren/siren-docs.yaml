notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Siren Federate extends Elasticsearch with a distributed join layer and join-caching
  layer.
- The Connector APIs have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in the next
  major release.
- Siren Federate provides a federation layer that enables the virtualization and querying
  of remote Elasticsearch clusters.
- The reflection layer enables the caching of data from external databases within
  Elasticsearch.
- Siren Federate provides a module called Connector which presents indices from remote
  Elasticsearch clusters as local to the cluster, denoted as 'virtual indices'.
- Siren Federate provides a feature called 'Reflection', which enables the import
  of data into Elasticsearch from an external datasource.
- The Siren Federate plugin extends Elasticsearch with federation, reflection, distributed
  join, and join-caching capabilities.
- The join query cache reduces query response time and improves scalability.
- Siren Federate extends Elasticsearch with a federation layer, reflection layer,
  distributed join layer, and join-caching layer.
- A reflection layer enables the caching of data from external databases within Elasticsearch.
- A reflection layer that enables the caching of data from external databases within
  Elasticsearch.
- A distributed join layer that enables the execution of join operations at scale.
- The Siren Federate plugin extends Elasticsearch with federation, reflection, and
  distributed join capabilities.
- Join query caching is provided to enhance performance.
- Join operations can be complex and require a common shared attribute between indices.
- Siren Federate provides a reflection layer that enables the caching of data from
  external databases within Elasticsearch.
- Siren Federate extends the Elasticsearch Query DSL with a join query clause.
- Siren Federate provides a module called Connector which presents indices from remote
  Elasticsearch clusters as local to the cluster.
- Siren Federate enables the import of data into Elasticsearch from an external datasource.
- The Siren Federate plugin extends Elasticsearch with functions such as federation,
  reflection, distributed joins, and join-caching.
- Siren Federate provides a module, called Connector, which presents indices from
  remote Elasticsearch clusters as local to the cluster, denoted as 'virtual indices'.
- The reflection of external databases enables the import of data into Elasticsearch
  from an external datasource.
- Requires OAuth2 setup.
- You can also install the product as a Windows or Linux service.
- When using Elasticsearch 8 or later, you must use xpack security to secure your
  installation.
- Uses environment variables for configuration
- Defaults are set for indices if not specified
- When using Elasticsearch 8 or later, you must use xpack security to secure your
  installation. Searchguard security is supported only in Elasticsearch version 7.x
  or earlier.
- Siren Investigate is accessible through port 5606.
- Environment variables take precedence over settings in investigate.yml
- Siren Investigate is accessed through port 5606.
- Default index pattern is selected when loading the Discover page.
- Installing Elasticsearch and Siren Investigate as a service is required only if
  you want Siren Investigate to start automatically at startup.
- Running Siren Investigate in a dedicated node will require at least 5GB of available
  memory to allow code optimization on initial startup.
- Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only to the user running the
  Siren Investigate process as it contains encryption keys to protect configuration
  settings stored in Elasticsearch.
- This feature requires that you are familiar with Docker and command line tools.
  You must also have Docker installed locally.
- White-labelling is the process of changing some elements in a product to reflect
  the branding of a company or organization deploying that product.
- If the keys are not in `investigate.yml`, you can add them, ensuring they are formatted
  exactly as shown.
- To change the images and/or favicons, perform the following steps.
- Ensure that the new image has exactly the same name as the image you are replacing
  it with.
- This feature requires that you are familiar with Docker and command line tools.
- Make sure to set ELASTICSEARCH_URL to the same value as 'elasticsearch.url' in the
  Investigate configuration file.
- Make sure your cluster is configured to effectively encrypt secrets.
- You can use the same command to create additional secrets referenced in your Investigate
  configuration file, such as TLS certificates and keys.
- Increase CONFIG_VERSION to force a StatefulSet upgrade after changing the configuration
  secret.
- Backup of system indices is stored in /opt/siren-investigate/data/
- When the Investigate upgrade command is executed, a local backup of the system indices
  is stored in `/opt/siren-investigate/data/`.
- By default, ECK is installed in the `elastic-system` namespace.
- Clusters created by the operator have a basic license enabled.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The password of the elastic administrative user is required.
- The certificate automatically generated by ECK does not contain localhost as a valid
  hostname.
- Only administrators can run reconciliation.
- New entity tables can be created either manually or based on existing Elasticsearch
  indices.
