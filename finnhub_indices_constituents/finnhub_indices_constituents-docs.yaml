auth_info:
- information_source; https://finnhub.io/docs/api:
  - API key authentication passed as the token query parameter. Initialize the finnhub.Client
    with api_key parameter, which is then automatically appended as token in requests.
  - API requests to this endpoint require a `token` query parameter for authentication.
    Include your API token as a query parameter named `token` in the request URL (e.g.,
    `?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN`).
  - Authentication is required via an API key passed as a query parameter named token.
    The token should be included in the request URL as &token=YOUR_API_KEY. In Python,
    initialize the finnhub.Client with api_key set to your token value.
  - Authentication is required via an API key passed as the token query parameter.
    Include token=YOUR_API_KEY in the request URL or pass api_key to the finnhub.Client()
    constructor in Python.
  - Authentication requires passing an API key as the token query parameter. In Python,
    initialize the finnhub.Client with your api_key argument, which automatically
    appends the token parameter to requests. Alternatively, append &token=YOUR_API_KEY
    directly to the query string.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://finnhub.io/docs/api:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with limit and skip query parameters. The
    limit parameter (required, max 25000) specifies how many ticks to return, and
    skip parameter (required) specifies the offset for retrieving subsequent pages.
    Clients loop through data by incrementing skip until all results are consumed.
  - The endpoint supports pagination via an optional limit parameter (query string)
    that controls the maximum number of results returned per request. When limit is
    omitted, the full list is returned. There is no indication of cursor-based pagination,
    next/previous fields, or multi-page navigation in the response.
  - The endpoint supports pagination via the `skip` query parameter (optional), which
    offsets the starting position in the results. The response structure and total
    count information are not detailed in the provided documentation, so the exact
    stopping condition and response pagination fields cannot be determined from this
    excerpt.
- information_source; https://finnhub.io/docs/api/indices-constituents:
  - The endpoint uses an optional query parameter limit to control the number of results
    returned. When limit is omitted, the full list is returned. There is no indication
    of cursor-based or page-based pagination; the limit parameter simply caps the
    result set size.
- information_source; https://finnhub.io/docs/api/quote:
  - The /stock/bbo endpoint uses offset-based pagination with limit and skip query
    parameters. The limit parameter (required, maximum 25000) specifies how many ticks
    to return, and skip parameter (required) specifies the offset. To paginate through
    all data, increment skip by the limit value in each request until fewer records
    than limit are returned.
