pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.cscglobal.com/cscglobal/docs/dbs/domainmanager/api-v2/oas.yaml:
  - Page and Size are query parameters for pagination. Page is used to specify which
    page to retrieve, and Size controls how many results per page. The response uses
    a PagedZoneResponse schema that contains the paginated data. Stop paginating when
    the current page reaches the total number of pages or when fewer results than
    the page size are returned.
  - Pagination is implemented using query parameters Page and Size, with optional
    Sort parameter. The response is structured as PagedBusinessUnitResponse, which
    contains paginated business unit data. Use Page and Size query parameters to control
    pagination; continue requesting with incremented Page values until the response
    indicates no more data.
  - Pagination uses query parameters size and page. The size parameter controls the
    number of results per page, and page specifies the page number (1-indexed). Response
    includes pagination metadata to navigate through pages.
  - Use ZoneEditSize parameter for pagination on zone edits GET requests, returning
    PagedZoneEditResponse. Exact parameter name, location (query/path), whether required/optional,
    and response pagination fields are not specified in this excerpt.
