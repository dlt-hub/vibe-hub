notes:
- If the directory server crashes, the core file will be written to the log directory
  for the server (/var/log/dirsrv/slapd-INSTANCENAME).
- The core file will be named *core.PID* where *PID* is the process id of the crashed
  server.
- EDIT the stacktrace.DATE.txt file TO REMOVE/OBSCURE ANY SENSITIVE DATA before you
  submit to the mail list or attach to a bug.
- This is not a commercial product, but rather a development project.
- EDIT the stacktrace.DATE.txt file TO REMOVE ANY SENSITIVE DATA before you submit
  to the mail list or attach to a bug
- You still need the debuginfo packages installed for this to work
- If the server crashes before the buffer is flushed, the information about the operation
  that caused the crash will not be written to the access log.
- Disabling access log buffering may cause the server to slow down considerably, which
  is not good in most production environments.
- Directory server provides a centralized directory service for intranet, network,
  and extranet information.
- LDAP is a protocol for accessing online directory services.
- Uses NSS for security, does not support OpenSSL or GnuTLS.
- Must submit clear text passwords for LDAP operations.
- The access log is buffered for performance reasons. Unfortunately, if the server
  crashes before the buffer is flushed, the information about the operation that caused
  the crash will not be written to the access log.
- Make sure you used the correct version of the JRE that setup requested, and make
  sure that you used a 'real' directory path to the JRE and not any symlinks.
- Make sure you specify the path to the JRE and not the JDK.
- You can either switch to a uni-processor kernel or install the Sun JDK 1.4.2_0x
  where x is 5 or higher. (JDK 1.5 is not tested).
- Do not use an absolute path to the startconsole script.
- The server is multi-threaded and efficiently handles many simultaneous requests.
- The server uses poll() on platforms where it is available.
- The number of connections the server can handle is set by the maximum number of
  descriptors minus the reserve descriptors.
- The number of threads is set by the attribute nsslapd-threadnumber in cn=config.
- The server creates a pool of operation threads.
- This setting does not require a server restart to take effect.
- Paged results control could be combined with the server side sorting.
- Kerberos relies heavily on the fully qualified host and domain name (FQDN) for service
  hosts and service principal names.
- Kerberos will not work unless all servers and clients are in time sync.
errors:
- 'LDAP_CONNECTION_ERROR: Check server address and credentials'
