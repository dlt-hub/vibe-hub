auth_info:
- information_source; https://slashapi.com/docs:
  - 'Authentication on SlashApi is optional by default but can be enabled via the
    dashboard. Two auth methods are supported: API Token authentication using the
    "X-API-KEY" header with your token value, or Bearer authentication using the "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" header where the token is obtained from an Authentication API
    login request. API Tokens can be assigned specific permissions to restrict API
    access.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain a token from the Authentication
    API login endpoint, then send it in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" with all API requests to https://v1.slashapi.com endpoints.'
- information_source; https://slashapi.com/docs/auth:
  - The API uses token-based authentication. After logging in via the Login endpoint,
    a token is returned in the response. To authenticate subsequent requests, include
    the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>" where <token> is the
    value obtained from login. The token does not expire by default and can be revoked
    using the Logout endpoint with the same Authorization header format.
