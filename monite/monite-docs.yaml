auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.monite.com/api/concepts/authentication:
  - All API requests to the Monite API must use Bearer token authentication compliant
    with OAuth 2.0. The Bearer token is generated from Client ID and Client Secret
    values obtained from the Monite Partner Portal. Additionally, the x-monite-entity-id
    HTTP header must be included in requests to specify the entity ID for resource
    access, and all requests must be made over HTTPS.
  - Entity user tokens are obtained by calling POST /auth/token with grant_type set
    to entity_user, providing client_id, client_secret, and entity_user_id in the
    JSON request body. The response contains an access_token with Bearer token_type
    and expires_in validity in seconds; use the access_token in subsequent requests
    for authentication tied to the specific entity user's role-based permissions.
  - Monite API uses OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication. Developers obtain Client
    ID and Client Secret from the Monite Partner Portal, then exchange them via POST
    /auth/token with grant_type (either client_credentials for backend-to-backend
    or entity_user for entity user access) to receive an access token. The /auth/token
    endpoint requires no authentication headers but accepts x-monite-version header
    for API versioning. Request body must contain client_id, client_secret, and grant_type
    fields. Client Secret must be stored securely and cannot be retrieved if lost.
  - 'The Monite API uses OAuth2 client credentials grant for token generation. To
    obtain a partner token, send a POST request to `/auth/token` with `grant_type`
    set to `client_credentials`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` in the JSON request
    body. Include the `X-Monite-Version` header and `Content-Type: application/json`.
    Tokens can be revoked via a POST request to the token revocation endpoint. Entity
    user tokens are also available and their permissions are role-based.'
  - The Monite API uses OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. To authenticate,
    POST to the token endpoint with grant_type, client_id, and client_secret in the
    JSON body to receive an access_token with Bearer token_type and expires_in validity
    period in seconds. Include the X-Monite-Version header with requests. Tokens can
    be revoked by POSTing to /auth/revoke with client_id, client_secret, and token
    in the request body. Use the access_token as a Bearer token in subsequent API
    requests.
