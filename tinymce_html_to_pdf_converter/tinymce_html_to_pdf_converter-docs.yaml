auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/individual-export-to-pdf-on-premises/:
  - JWT authentication is required. Create a HS256-signed JWT token using a shared
    SECRET_KEY, then pass it in the Authorization header (without Bearer prefix) when
    making requests to the API endpoint.
  - The API supports optional authorization via bearer tokens. If authorization is
    enabled, provide an authorization token (refer to the authorization section for
    details). For fetching secured resources in PDF generation, pass additional HTTP
    headers either via the EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS environment variable (stringified JSON
    object) at application startup, or in the request options under the extra_http_headers
    field. Headers from request options take precedence over application config headers.

  - Authentication uses JWT tokens passed in the Authorization header. Generate a
    JWT token by signing an empty object with a shared SECRET_KEY using HS256 algorithm,
    then include it as the Authorization header value in requests to the conversion
    endpoints.
  - JWT token must be provided as an `Authorization` header in API requests. When
    using API clients like Postman or Insomnia, set the JWT token directly in the
    `Authorization` header without using built-in token authorization, as that adds
    an invalid `Bearer` prefix. The token should be sent as a plain header value.
  - To enable authorization, set the SECRET_KEY environment variable during installation.
    If SECRET_KEY is set, all requests must include a JWT (JSON Web Token) signed
    with that key passed in the Authorization header.
