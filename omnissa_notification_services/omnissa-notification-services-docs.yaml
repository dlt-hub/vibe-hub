notes:
- Uses OAuth2 authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Module provides cmdlets for CRUD operations on Horizon API services.
- All API calls require authentication using an Access Token.
- The access token will have a time to live value of 2 hours by default.
- Refresh token expiry can be defined in hours, minimum - 3 hours.
- Users must include the access_token as a Bearer token in the Authorization Header
- To convert time to epoch milliseconds you can use various web tools.
- Access token can be reused until it expires.
- Token time to live is set on client creation.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Make sure you’re in Customer OG or below to access the API.
- Requires setup of connected app in Workspace ONE UEM.
- Specifies that you want to remove all existing connections to the specified servers.
- Horizon PowerCLI is based on View APIs which are scheduled to be deprecated in future
  releases.
- Starting June 2024 version 24.06 onwards, Workspace ONE SDK for Android will NOT
  be distributed through the My Workspace ONE portal.

  to your AirWatch Admin Console and pushed down to your test device for your first
  installation.
- Every subsequent test can be side-loaded directly from your IDE.
- 'Important Update Starting June 2024: Workspace ONE SDK for Android will NOT be
  distributed through the My Workspace ONE portal.'
- The SDK is accessible from a Maven repository.
- Support for Android 16 KB page size.

- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- 'HTTP 401 (Unauthorized): Check if the token is present and hasn''t expired.'
