notes:
- 'It is recommended to install VNTranslator for all users at: (C:\Program Files\VNTranslator)'
- VNTranslator uses a built-in queue system with configurable delays to prevent sending
  too many requests to translation services.
- Translation Memory stores previously translated text and automatically reuses it
  when the same text appears again.
- Define custom translations for specific terms or character names to maintain consistency
  throughout the game.
- The Extra Window can display one or more of Translated Text, Original Text, JParser,
  Jisho Dictionary.
- Always on Top may not work with some games using exclusive fullscreen mode.
- Background Effect is available again starting from version v0.9.0-beta.
- 'For Japanese games: WinOCR: Japanese, Tesseract: Japanese (jpn.traineddata)'
- 'For English games: WinOCR: English (United States) or English (United Kingdom),
  Tesseract: English (eng.traineddata)'
- AutoTrans may not work with all games and can affect performance.
- Because it translates text in real-time within the game, you may experience lag
  while the game waits for translation responses.
- Complete tool for translating RenPy games. Some methods may not work in some games.
- Textractor is not actively developed anymore. As a result, some newer visual novel
  games may not work properly.
- You must add TextractorCLI.exe as an exception in both Windows Defender and your
  antivirus software.
- Not all Unity games are supported. Game compatibility depends on the Unity version,
  engine modifications, and anti-cheat systems
- Some games may crash or freeze when using XUAT, especially games with custom Unity
  builds or protection systems
- Some parameters are only available in the Pro version.
- Uses LocalServer to load the model just once for faster recognition.
- Running OCR with large models can be slow when executed directly via the command
  line.
- Using LocalServer helps resolve this by loading the model just once.
- OCR-GX is optimized for Window Capture, though Screen Capture is still available
  as an option
- Translated text appears directly over the original text within the OCR bounding
  box
- VNTranslator Pro is a subscription service.
- If you cancel your pledge, you will still have access to VNTranslator Pro until
  your next billing date.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Integration with XUAT Plugin @bbepis
- Pre-processing is primarily useful for traditional OCR engines (Tesseract OCR and
  Windows OCR).
- If you're using modern OCR engines like Fast OCR or AI-based engines (Google Cloud
  Vision, Azure Cloud Vision), you can skip pre-processing.
- Post-processing refines the OCR output after the text has been recognized.
- Post-processing is useful for all OCR engine types.
- Hardware acceleration is enabled by default in VNTranslator
- Translation Timeout is set to 10000ms (10 seconds) by default.
- VNTranslator Pro now supports display scaling through app settings, but using 100%
  Windows scaling can still provide the most consistent results.
- Textractor is no longer actively developed, so some newer visual novel games may
  not work with the current version.
- Check your internet connection
- Restart MT / Clear Cookies & Site Data
- Disabling VPN if you are using it
- Add an exception for VNTranslator to Windows Firewall
- If you're still having issues, restart your PC. This clears temporary files which
  can cause connection issues
- Translation timeout is set to 10000ms (10 seconds) by default.
- Clearing cookies can resolve many timeout issues, especially when you've hit usage
  limits.
- Default Translation Timeout is set to 10000ms (10 seconds).
- Free API access allows you to translate up to 500,000 characters per month for free.
- Complete the subscription process to get your API key.
- Starting from Neo v0.8.2-beta and Pro v0.9.1-beta, we have renamed 'MT Settings'
  to 'Service Settings' for better clarity.
- Displays translation services available for installation
- Displays engines that are already installed
- Displays available updates for your installed services
- DeepL offers free API access that allows you to translate up to 500,000 characters
  per month for free.
- If you need more than that, you can purchase a DeepL API Pro subscription.
