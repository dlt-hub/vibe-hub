auth_info:
- information_source; https://fliphtml5.com/rlty/ibjw/Rest_API_Documentation_v2.17/:
  - The API requires an application key for authentication. Include your app key in
    the XML request structure within the `<appkey>YOURAPPKEY</appkey>` element. The
    XML is then URI-encoded and sent as the `xml_request` query parameter in an HTTP
    GET request to `http://api.slippymap.com/rest`.
  - The API uses an appkey-based authentication scheme. Every request must include
    an appkey (a UUID-like string) embedded within an XML request body passed as the
    xml_request query parameter. The appkey is validated server-side against the requesting
    domain name and IP address to ensure requests originate from an authorized source.
    Obtain your appkey by providing your server's domain name and IP address to the
    client services representative or technical support.
