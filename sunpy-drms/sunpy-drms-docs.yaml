notes:
- The continued growth and development of SunPy is dependent on the community being
  aware of SunPy.
- If you use SunPy in your scientific work, we would appreciate citing it in your
  publications.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses REST API
- The maximum records in HECClient now are 20000.
- A pure Python `sunpy` wheel is now published on PyPI with each release.
- Able to detect gzip-compressed FITS files even if they don’t have the `.gz` extension
  in the filename.
- Fixed reading CDF files when a column has no entries.
- The default id_type in sunpy.coordinates.get_horizons_coord() is now None.
- Fill values are now set to numpy.nan in sunpy.timeseries.sources.noaa file parsers.
- sunpy.map.GenericMap.date now looks for more metadata than just DATE-OBS.
- The code that is under sunpy.instr is imported via sunkit_instruments to ensure
  backwards comparability.
- Several sunpy.map.GenericMap attributes have been updated to return None when the
  relevant piece of FITS metadata is missing.
- Data products from NOAAIndicesClient and NOAAPredictClient have been updated to
  download new JSON files.
- Removed un-used and un-tested code paths in the private `_remove_lytaf_events` function
  in `sunpy.instr.lyra`.
- Errors from a VSO search will now be raised to the user.
- The callback functions provided to `BaseFuncAnimator` `button_func` keyword argument
  now take two positional arguments rather than one.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 'The SunPy data directory “~/sunpy” is no longer created until it is used (issue
  #2018)'
- Sunpy is now Python 3.x compatible (3.4 and 3.5).
- Uses API calls to access and retrieve data from JSOC.
- A registered email address is required to submit export requests.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- 'PartialFetchError: Raised when only some of the search results are downloaded.'
