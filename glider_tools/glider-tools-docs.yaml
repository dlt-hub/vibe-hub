notes:
- 'Removing outliers with IQR * 2.5: 1551 obs'
- Removing spikes with rolling median (spike window=5)
- Removing horizontal outliers (fraction=0.2, multiplier=2.5)
- Smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter (window=11, order=2)
- The optics module contains functions that process backscatter, PAR and fluorescence.
- Mask bad profiles based on deep values (ref depth=300m)
- Number of bad profiles = 19/672
- Dark count correction
- Quenching correction
- Spike identification (spike window=11)
- Generating figures for despiking and quenching report
- Bottle calibration can be done using the calibration module.
- The bottle file needs to be in a specific format with dates (datetime64 format),
  depth and the variable values.
- GliderTools automatically selects bin sizes according to the sampling frequency
  of the dataset for every 50m.
- Gridded data can be passed to the plot function without x- and y-coordinates, as
  these are contained in the gridded data.
- Contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated.
- Never commit to master.
