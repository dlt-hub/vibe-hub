auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.dribbble.com/v2/:
  - Authentication via OAuth2 bearer token. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}" for authenticated requests to the Dribbble API
    v2 endpoint at api.dribbble.com/v2/.
  - 'Dribbble API supports two authentication methods: OAuth2 token sent in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer OAUTH_TOKEN" or as a query parameter named "access_token". OAuth2
    authenticated requests are rate-limited to 60 requests per minute and 1,440 requests
    per day per user.'
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required. Send the access token either as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header (Authorization: Bearer OAUTH_TOKEN) or as a query
    parameter. The exact parameter name for query string submission is not fully shown
    in the provided text.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.dribbble.com/v2/:
  - Pagination uses a `page` query parameter passed in the query string, as shown
    in the example `https://api.dribbble.com/v2/user/shots?page=2`. No response fields,
    default values, or stopping conditions are documented in this excerpt.
  - Requests return 30 items by default and are paginated using the `page` query parameter
    (optional, defaults to 1). The `per_page` parameter (optional, up to 100) sets
    custom page size on supported endpoints. Pagination links are provided in the
    Link header with rel="next" and rel="prev" values; follow these URLs instead of
    constructing your own.
  - Use query parameter `page` for pagination requests. The documentation references
    a pagination section but does not provide details about response fields, page
    size limits, or stopping conditions in this excerpt.
