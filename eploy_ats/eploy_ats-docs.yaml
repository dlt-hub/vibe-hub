auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.eploy.com/resources/developers/api/:
  - Access to the Eploy API requires API keys and uses OAuth2 for authentication.
    API keys are generated within the Eploy System and are tied to a specific user
    record, inheriting only the permissions granted to that user. Each API key controls
    access to data based on the associated user's permissions.
