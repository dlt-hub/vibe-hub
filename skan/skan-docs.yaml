notes:
- Skan’s primary purpose is to analyse skeletons.
- Skan provides functions for drawing skeletons in 2D.
- Download and extract the zipfile, and make sure the schizonts folder contained within
  it is placed in this notebook’s working directory.
- Uses synthetic data for demonstration purposes.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Finally, we can color the paths by a numerical property, such as their length.
- We use synthetic data here. If you have a cool 3D skeleton dataset that you’d like
  to show off in these docs, let us know!
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
