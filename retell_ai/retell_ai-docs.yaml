notes:
- Authentication header containing API key (find it in dashboard). The format is "Bearer
  YOUR_API_KEY".
- Start with LLM Playground - Begin by manually chatting with your agent to iteratively
  improve its capabilities.
- Progress to LLM Simulation Testing - Once you have a functional agent, test it with
  predefined customer scenarios to evaluate its performance.
- Conduct Web Call/Phone Call Testing - Test your agent in real-world conditions through
  actual phone calls to assess its handling of voice interactions.
- Implement Batch Testing - Create and run multiple test cases to ensure your agent
  maintains stability and performance across various scenarios, especially after making
  changes.
- To improve the visibility into why outbound call dialing fails, we are refactoring
  the disconnection reasons and call status field for these unconnected calls.
- Existing disconnections reasons related to unconnected calls will stay, but 'dial_failed'
  will contain less scenarios — representing cases where SIP error codes are not available,
  or error unknown.
- These unconnected calls will not have a status of 'error', but instead will have
  a status of 'not_connected'.
- This change will be a breaking change for some users' existing codebase, so it’s
  recommended to not rely on status filter to find these unconnected calls.
- Original settings are still supported in API until 6/30/2025, after that they will
  be deprecated.
- Uses the Retell public key system for direct API calls from the frontend
errors:
- '201: Successfully made an outbound call.'
