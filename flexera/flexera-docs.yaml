auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.flexera.com/appportal/2020r1/ag/Content/helplibrary/ABAPI_GetStart.htm:
  - The App Broker REST API requires a valid license file with API access permissions
    to be uploaded during App Portal initialization. Unauthorized users attempting
    to access API endpoints will receive either a 401 unauthorized or 500 internal
    server error response. Users and groups must be added through the REST API tab
    in App Portal to gain API access.
- information_source; https://docs.flexera.com/cloudmigration/ug/Content/helplibrary/FCRESTfulAPI.htm:
  - All API methods require a temporary authentication token obtained from the /1_0/getAuthToken
    endpoint. Authentication for token retrieval requires user ID (email address)
    and user password. Additionally, an API key (requested from Subscription Administration
    page) and an assessment code (visible to subscription administrators) are required
    to access the API.
  - All API methods require a temporary authentication token obtained from the /1_0/getAuthToken
    endpoint. To retrieve the token, send a request with user ID (email address),
    user password, assessment code (from Subscription Administration page), and API
    key. The returned token must be used for all subsequent API calls and is valid
    for up to 8 hours but expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. A deprecated authentication
    scheme using a password and API key combination is no longer supported.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/RetrieveData.htm:
  - 'Pagination information is present. This documentation describes a pagination
    configuration system with two main components: get_page_marker retrieves the pagination
    token from the response (via body_path using XPath/JSON path or header), and set_page_marker
    specifies where to place that token in the next request (via query parameter,
    header, body field, or URI). For example, AWS pagination extracts PageToken from
    the response body and sets it as the NextToken query parameter in subsequent requests.'
- ? information_source; https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/RetrieveData.htm?Highlight=API%20Data%20with%20Datasources
  : - 'Pagination is defined using a pagination block with two sub-blocks: get_page_marker
      extracts the next page token from a response via body_path (using XPath or JSONPath)
      or header, and set_page_marker inserts the token into subsequent requests via
      query parameter, header, body field, or URI. Exactly one extraction method and
      one insertion method must be specified per block.'
- information_source; https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/RetrieveData.htm?Highlight=API+Data+with+Datasources:
  - Pagination is configured using a pagination block that defines how to extract
    the next page token from a response via get_page_marker (using body_path or header)
    and where to insert it into subsequent queries via set_page_marker (using query,
    header, body_field, or uri). For example, AWS XML responses with PageToken in
    the body should extract it via XPath body_path and insert it as a NextToken query
    parameter in subsequent requests.
