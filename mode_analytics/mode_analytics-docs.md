In this guide, we'll set up a complete Mode data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def mode_analytics_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.mode.com/api/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "basic",
                "username": api_token,
                "password": api_secret
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "groups",
            "memberships",
            "spaces"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='mode_analytics_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='mode_analytics_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(mode_analytics_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from mode_analytics‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Groups: Manage and retrieve information about groups.
- Memberships: Handle memberships within the system.
- Spaces: Operations related to workspaces or designated areas in Mode.
- Reports: Facilitates the management and retrieval of reports.
- Queries: Handle queries and their executions.
- Datasets: Manage datasets and their runs.
- Schedules: Setup and manage schedules for reports and datasets.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Mode workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@mode_analytics-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Mode support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:mode_analytics duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Mode API, as specified in @mode_analytics-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "groups" and "memberships" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in mode_analytics_pipeline.py and name the pipeline mode_analytics_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python mode_analytics_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done using Basic Authentication with API token and API secret. The token and secret should be included in the request headers.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://mode.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python mode_analytics_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline mode_analytics load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset mode_analytics_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/mode_analytics.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline mode_analytics_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("mode_analytics_pipeline").dataset()
   # get groups table as Pandas frame
   data.groups.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure the API token and secret are valid to avoid 401 Unauthorized errors. Confirm endpoint paths and parameters to prevent 404 Not Found errors. Implement an exponential backoff strategy for handling 429 Too Many Requests errors.
