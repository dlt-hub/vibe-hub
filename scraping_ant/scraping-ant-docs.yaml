- For enabling JS rendering, `browser` boolean parameter should be set to `true` (default
  value).
- For disabling JS rendering, `browser` boolean parameter should be set to `false`.
- By default, ScrapingAnt will pick the random proxy from the standard (datacenter)
  proxy pool to proceed with a scraping request.
- Each new request would be performed with a new IP from our proxy pool, which makes
  it appear like all the requests are coming from different users.
- Our service uses high quality proxies with a low latency access, so all the proxies
  are 100% alive.
- Every URL fetching time is limited to 60 seconds, so be aware of it while writing
  your Javascript snippet.
- Javascript library automatically encodes JS snippet for you, so, please, avoid encoding
  on your side.

  work with styles, JS and HTML tags.
- AI extractor is multi-language, but it works best when input parameters described
  in English for the proper JSON structure names.
