pagination_info:
- information_source; https://enrichlayer.com/docs:
  - Pagination uses next_page_no and next_page_api_url fields in the response to navigate
    forward, with previous_page_no and previous_page_api_url for backward navigation.
    Use the provided next_page_api_url directly for the next request, and stop when
    next_page_no is null.
  - Pagination uses page_size query parameter to control results per request. The
    endpoint is deprecated and specific stopping conditions are not documented.
  - The API uses page_size as a query parameter to control pagination. The documentation
    shows page_size=10 in the example but does not specify whether it is required
    or optional, its default value, or maximum limit. No response fields indicating
    pagination state (such as next, has_more, total_count, or page number) are described
    in the provided documentation.
  - The Student Listing Endpoint uses query parameter `page_size` to control pagination
    size (example shows value of 10). However, the documentation provided does not
    describe request parameters for navigating between pages (such as page number
    or cursor), response fields indicating pagination state (such as next, has_more,
    or total_count), or rules for determining when to stop paginating. Without these
    details, complete pagination behavior cannot be determined.
  - The response includes a `next_page` field containing the API URI for the next
    page of results, or null when no further pages exist. Use the `next_page` URI
    value to retrieve subsequent pages.
