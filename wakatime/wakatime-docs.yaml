auth_info:
- information_source; https://wakatime.com/developers:
  - Scope-based authorization required. The API requires the write_heartbeats scope
    to create or update durations. Authentication credentials (likely API key or bearer
    token) must be provided with the request, though the specific header or parameter
    name is not detailed in this excerpt.
  - The WakaTime API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. Create an app at https://wakatime.com/apps
    to obtain an OAuth 2.0 client token. All API resources are accessed via the url
    prefix https://api.wakatime.com/api/v1/. Do not use your secret key on public
    websites; instead use embeddable charts for public access.
  - WakaTime uses OAuth2 for authentication. Applications must register at https://wakatime.com/apps
    to obtain a client_id and client_secret, then initiate an authorization flow by
    redirecting users to https://wakatime.com/oauth/authorize with scope, response_type,
    state, and redirect_uri parameters. After user authorization, exchange the returned
    authorization code for an access token at https://wakatime.com/oauth/token using
    grant_type authorization_code. Available scopes include email and read_stats.languages.
    The access token is then used in subsequent API requests to https://wakatime.com/api/v1/.
  - WakaTime uses OAuth2 with client credentials and tokens sent in request bodies.
    Token revocation requires client_id and client_secret as form parameters in POST
    requests to /oauth/revoke, optionally with user_id, token, or all=true parameters.
    API scopes are space or comma-separated strings (e.g., read_summaries, read_summaries.languages)
    requested during authorization to grant optional permissions for accessing user
    summaries, stats, and related data.
  - WakaTime uses OAuth2 with refresh token flow. To obtain tokens, POST to /oauth/token
    with client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, and grant_type. When access_token
    expires, use refresh_token to get a new token by POSTing to /oauth/token with
    client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, grant_type set to refresh_token, and the
    refresh_token. To revoke tokens, POST to /oauth/revoke with client_id, client_secret,
    and token (or user_id to revoke all tokens for a user). Request bodies support
    both application/json and application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Type.
