auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.17/reference-enterprise-api-ref-vcs-settings.html:
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Send credentials as username:password
    in the Authorization header using the format --user <username>:<password> (curl
    automatically encodes this as base64 in the Authorization: Basic header).'
  - 'The API endpoint requires HTTP Basic Authentication using the --user flag with
    username:password credentials. Additionally, the request body accepts optional
    Git authentication parameters: gitUsername and gitPassword (for username/password
    or token-based Git auth), or gitPrivateKey (for SSH key-based Git authentication).
    These Git credentials are used to authenticate against the Git repository specified
    in gitServer, not the API itself.'
- information_source; https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/revamp/api-enterprise-api-ref-vcs-settings.html:
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Credentials must be sent using the --user flag
    in curl, which translates to a Basic Authorization header with base64-encoded
    username:password in the format Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>.'
  - The API requires HTTP Basic Authentication using username and password credentials
    passed via the --user flag in curl, which translates to an Authorization header
    with Base64-encoded credentials in the format "username:password". Additionally,
    Git repository access may require gitUsername, gitPassword (or token), or gitPrivateKey
    parameters in the JSON request body for private repository authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.cfengine.com/latest/api-enterprise-api-ref-two-factor-authentication.html:
  - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
    via the --user flag (HTTP Basic Auth). Additionally, when disabling 2FA for the
    current user, a Cf-2FA-Token header containing a 6-digit code from an authentication
    application must be provided. Admin users with the "Disable 2FA for any user"
    RBAC role (alias 2fa.any-user.disable) can disable 2FA for other users.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cfengine.com/latest/api-enterprise-api-ref-vcs-settings.html:
  - The response includes pagination metadata with page (set to 1), count (10), and
    total (1) fields in the meta object, but no request parameters for pagination
    control are documented. The endpoint appears to return a single fixed result set
    rather than supporting paginated requests.
