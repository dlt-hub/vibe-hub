notes:
- This guide is for the original release of AQtive Guard. For the current AQG SaaS
  platform, go to the AQtive Guard User Guide.
- When uploading and analyzing a trace from the command line, we recommend using the
  API client designed for this purpose.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The API key is only given once. If you forget it, you must repeat the reset procedure
  to retrieve a new key.
- The integration uses Tanium File Evidence in the Threat Response module to retrieve
  files from endpoints without impacting the rest of the Tanium platform.
- For optimal performance, we recommend setting the number of parallel trace uploads
  to 3 in most large enterprise environments. For sensitive environments or those
  with a limited number of endpoints, a setting of 1 is recommended.
- Only administrators have permission to edit or test a computer group, and launch,
  stop, or unlink a retrieval.
- Use GraphQL requests to interact with the Tanium API
- The project ID (`projectId`) is always an integer.
- The project node `id` returned from a GraphQL query is a mix of numbers and upper-
  and lower-case letters.
