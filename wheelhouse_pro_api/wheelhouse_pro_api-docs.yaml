auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.usewheelhouse.com/wheelhouse_lite_api:
  - LiteApiKey authorization is required. This appears to be an API key-based auth
    scheme, likely passed as a header or query parameter named LiteApiKey or similar,
    though the exact transmission method is not explicitly detailed in the provided
    documentation.
  - The API uses LiteApiKey authentication. The API key must be provided as an authorization
    credential (typically in the Authorization header or as a query parameter named
    api_key, depending on Wheelhouse's implementation). Include the LiteApiKey with
    each request to the endpoint to verify if a location is covered by a Wheelhouse
    market.
  - The API uses an API key authentication scheme called LiteApiKey. The exact method
    of passing this key (header name, query parameter name, or other location) is
    not explicitly specified in the provided documentation.
- information_source; https://api.usewheelhouse.com/wheelhouse_pro_api:
  - API key authentication is required. Users must create an API key from their account
    settings and pass it in the X-User-API-Key header to authenticate requests for
    retrieving and updating listings and pulling price recommendations. For creating
    new end users, IntegrationApiKey authorization is required.
  - 'IntegrationApiKey or UserApiKey authentication is required. Two authorization
    types are supported: IntegrationApiKey and UserApiKey. The specific method for
    sending these credentials (header name, parameter name, or request body field)
    is not documented in the provided text.'

- information_source; https://api.usewheelhouse.com/wheelhouse_pro_api:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: offset (integer, number of records
    to skip), page (integer, page number), and per_page (integer, default 50, number
    of results per page). Response is a JSON array of reservation objects with no
    explicit pagination metadata fields or next/previous indicators shown.'
  - Use offset (integer), page (integer), or per_page (integer) query parameters to
    paginate listings. The exclude_inactive boolean query parameter filters results.
