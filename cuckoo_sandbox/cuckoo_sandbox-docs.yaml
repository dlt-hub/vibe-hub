pagination_info:
- information_source; https://cuckoo.readthedocs.io/en/1.2/usage/api/:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (maximum number of returned
    tasks) and offset (data offset). Both are integers and optional, with no specified
    defaults or maximum values mentioned.'
  - The /tasks/list endpoint uses limit and offset query parameters for pagination.
    The response returns a tasks array; use the limit and offset values to construct
    subsequent requests to retrieve additional pages of results.
- information_source; https://cuckoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/api/:
  - Use limit (optional, integer, query parameter) and offset (optional, integer,
    query parameter) to paginate through tasks. Response contains tasks array; construct
    next request by incrementing offset by limit value until fewer tasks than limit
    are returned.
  - Use query parameters limit (optional, int) for maximum returned tasks and offset
    (optional, int) for data offset to paginate through tasks. No response fields
    indicate pagination state or next page location.
- information_source; https://cuckoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dist/:
  - 'The GET /api/task endpoint supports pagination through optional query parameters:
    offset and limit. The limit parameter controls the number of results returned
    per request. Additionally, finished and owner query parameters are available for
    filtering results.'
