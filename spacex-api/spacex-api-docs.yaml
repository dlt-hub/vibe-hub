# Known Quirks or Risks, Caveats
notes:
  - The SpaceX API has both v4 and v5 for launches; the connector as default uses V4 as it has minimal bugs.

# Troubleshooting & Error Patterns
errors:
  - REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency
  - 404 Not Found: Check the endpoint path or resource availability
  - 401 Unauthorized: Check the API key validity
