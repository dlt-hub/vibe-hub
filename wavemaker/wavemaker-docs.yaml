auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.wavemaker.com/learn/app-development/app-security/token-based-authentication/:
  - Token-based authorization is used to access APIs. Pass the token via HTTP header
    parameter `wm_auth_token` or as a query parameter `wm_auth_token`. If the token
    appears in both locations, the query parameter takes precedence. Tokens are valid
    for 1800 seconds by default and can be customized in project-security-provider.xml.
    Invalid or expired tokens return a 401 unauthorized response. Header-based transmission
    is recommended over query parameters for security reasons.
- information_source; https://www.wavemaker.com/learn/app-development/services/api-designer/import-rest-apis-swagger/:
  - Swagger-imported APIs support OAuth 2.0 authentication. Configure the OAuth Provider
    with Access Token URL, Client ID, and Client Secret values obtained from the REST
    service provider.
- information_source; https://www.wavemaker.com/learn/app-development/services/web-services/rest-services/:
  - HTTP Authentication can be set to None (default), Basic (username and password),
    or OAuth 2.0. For OAuth 2.0, you must provide Client Id and Client Secret to configure
    an OAuth Provider; WaveMaker supports most standard OAuth providers and allows
    adding custom ones.
- information_source; https://www.wavemaker.com/learn/hybrid-mobile/invoking-web-app-apis-mobile-apps/:
  - The documentation describes two approaches for accessing WaveMaker Web App APIs
    from Hybrid Mobile Apps. For authenticated APIs, use either HTTP Authentication
    during service import or pass an authorization token as a Header. For unauthenticated
    APIs, import the REST service directly without credentials. The specific header
    name for the authorization token is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt.
