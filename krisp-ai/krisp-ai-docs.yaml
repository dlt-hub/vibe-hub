notes:
- Integrated in client apps (native and browser) and on server (Voice AI Agents)
- Integrates into the local application’s audio path (e.g. WebRTC)
- 'The SDK is designed to be deployed server-side and supports multiple language bindings:
  Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, C++, C.'
- Single-threaded execution will be the default in the next Server SDK release.
- Krisp SDK integration guide published at https://docs.pipecat.ai/guides/features/krisp
  is not compatible with the latest Krisp Server SDK and models.
- BVC technology does not require user voice enrollment or training on user voice
  data.
- BVC technology is incompatible with Narrow Band devices with sampling rates of <=8KHz.
- Accent Conversion (AC) requires no configuration or enrollment and is compatible
  with all headsets used in call center environments.
- Outbound models are optimized for a single main speaker and raw microphone inputs.
- Inbound models tolerate voice degradations caused by lossy audio codecs.
- CPU% is generally higher in JS SDK compared to native SDK. This is expected as the
  code runs in the browser in different worker threads, which provides improved stability
  and eliminates memory leaks.
- 8K audio stream is not supported by the Safari browser due to the Apple WebKit limitations.
- Ensure that the AudioContext sample rate is in the list of supported rates to avoid
  issues such as noise cancellation malfunction or sound distortion.
- Users can switch their audio devices in the middle of using the SDK, so it's essential
  to handle new noise cancellation filter creation when the input source has changed.
- 'Only in Chrome: When ''Echo Cancellation'' option is selected, in some Chrome versions
  it’s processing aggressively and muffles speech.'
- 'Only in Chrome: When using the AudioElement playback method, there may be voice
  degradation when switching between devices.'
- Randomly, after switching between built-in device microphones and headsets, there
  may be BVC quality degradation with secondary voices passing.
- Session stats can be retrieved at intervals defined by the sessionStatsIntervalMS
  parameter.
- Per-frame stats can be retrieved at intervals defined by the perFrameStatsCountInterval
  parameter.
- Noise suppression aggressiveness level in the range of [0, 100].
- The VAD threshold is a configurable value that dictates when an audio signal is
  classified as speech or silence.
- To enable Debug Mode, simply switch the debugLogs flag when initializing the Krisp
  SDK in your code.
- Integrates Krisp's JS SDK for noise cancellation in web applications
- By default Krisp filter is not enabled.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Only the microphone stream is tested, which means that the sound is captured using
  the microphone only.
- The most advanced and the most complicated solutions
- Krisp SDK for native mobile applications is a C-library.
- Krisp SDKs are deployed and in use globally across more than 200M end-user applications
  and devices.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Current version 121 corresponds to Chrome version 121.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed for successful operation.
- You may manually build WebRTC with Audio Hook to allow sound stream modification
  within the IOS app.
- The last command may fail depending on XCode configuration and issues with the provisioning
  profile.
