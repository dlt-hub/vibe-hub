  - 'API requests require four authentication headers: Sign (authentication string),
    App-Key (application identifier), Customer-No (customer ID), and Timestamp (request
    timestamp in unix format). The Sign header is computed as an authentication credential,
    likely derived from App-Key and a secret key using the Timestamp value.'
  - Request parameter signing is required. Refer to the Authentication String documentation
    for specific signing methods. The signing mechanism is used to authenticate requests
    sent to the API.
