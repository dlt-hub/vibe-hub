auth_info:

  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Obtain a Bearer token by providing
    Client ID and Client Secret Key to the support team; the token is valid for 60
    minutes. Include the token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer
    YOUR_API_KEY" with all API requests.'
  - The TAP API requires Bearer token authentication obtained through Client ID and
    Client Secret Key credentials. Users must log into TAP, navigate to the Swagger
    section, enter the Client ID and Client Secret Key provided by the support team,
    and a Bearer token will be generated for use in API requests.
- information_source; https://success.mitratech.com/TAP/TAP_Solutions/APIs_and_Integrations/TAP_API_Documentation:
  - 'Access to this API requires an access token sent via the Authorization header
    using the Bearer scheme. Include the token in the request header as "Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token}" where {access_token} is your obtained token value.'
  - 'Access token is required and must be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer
    token. Example: Authorization: Bearer d57fc1d99d15f18f9234aa181853d805'
  - 'Access token is required and must be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer
    token. Include the header Authorization: Bearer <access_token> in your request,
    where <access_token> is your authentication token obtained from the service.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://success.mitratech.com/TAP/TAP_Solutions/APIs_and_Integrations/TAP_API_Documentation:
  - Pagination uses `$top` (maximum number of records to return) and `$skip` (number
    of records to skip) as query parameters. Set `$inlinecount` to 'allpages' to receive
    total count in the response within the Items array.
  - Pagination uses query parameters $top (max records), $skip (records to skip),
    and $inlinecount set to 'allpages' for total count. Response includes Items array,
    Count field (when $inlinecount='allpages'), and NextPageLink (null when no more
    pages).
  - Pagination uses query parameters `$top` (page size) and `$skip` (offset) to request
    pages. The response includes an `Items` array with records, a `NextPageLink` field
    indicating the next page URL (null when no more pages), and a `Count` field for
    total count when `$inlinecount=allpages` is set.
  - Pagination uses required query parameters pageSize (page size) and page (page
    number). The response includes NextPageLink (null when no more pages) and Count
    (total records). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter
    value.
  - 'The API uses OData-style query parameters for pagination: `$top` specifies the
    maximum number of records to return, `$skip` specifies how many records to skip
    (both optional), and `$inlinecount` set to ''allpages'' returns the total count
    in the response. Use `$skip` with `$top` to navigate pages by incrementing the
    skip value.'
