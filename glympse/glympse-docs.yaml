  - The Glympse Core REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Client applications
    use API keys to obtain temporary credentials. Additional details on the specific
    implementation (token endpoint, grant types, required headers, scopes, and how
    to use the credentials) are not provided in this excerpt.
  - 'The Glympse REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Client applications obtain
    temporary access tokens using API keys, then supply these tokens in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token for subsequent API requests. The required header format
    is Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}.'
- information_source; https://developer.glympse.com/docs/core/api/guides:
  - The API uses credentials (username/password or email/password) sent in a JSON
    request body to authenticate users. After successful authentication, the API returns
    credentials that can be used to log in or refresh an access token. The response
    includes an expiration time for the credentials.

  - The Glympse Core REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Client applications
    use API keys to obtain temporary credentials. The API endpoint format is https://api.glympse.com
    with versioning like /v2/. Further details on how to obtain and use these credentials
    are not provided in this excerpt.
  - The Glympse REST API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. Client applications obtain
    an access token using API keys via the account/login endpoint, then supply the
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer ${access_token}" for all subsequent
    API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.glympse.com/docs/core/api/guides/sharing-guide:
  - Use the `since` query parameter (optional, pass `since=0` for initial snapshot)
    in GET /v2/users/self/invites requests. The response includes an array of invites
    and a `last_refresh` value; use `last_refresh` as the next `since` value to retrieve
    only updates since the last call.
  - Use the `since` query parameter to poll for updates. Pass the `last_refresh` value
    from the previous response as the `since` parameter in subsequent requests to
    retrieve only changes that occurred since the last invocation.
- information_source; https://developer.glympse.com/docs/core/api/guides/viewing-guide:
  - The API uses a cursor-based polling pagination scheme. The `next` query parameter
    is required and initialized to 0 for the initial snapshot; subsequent requests
    use the `next` value from the previous response to retrieve appended updates.
    The API may return a full snapshot instead of incremental updates if the gap between
    calls is significant.
