- Webhook configuration requires admin permissions or custom role with specific permission.
- Porting any number will result in the loss of voice functionality on that number,
  as Textline does not have voice capabilities.
- Enable the Integration Option for When messages are added to a Zendesk ticket, add
  them as a public comment, not a private note.
- Textline provides various options for syncing conversation info with HubSpot.
- The widget is automatically installed as a HubSpot CRM Card when connected.
