notes:
- Requests must include a hash using a Shared Secret for security.
- Only whitelisted IP addresses can send transactions to the Live environment.
- Elavon Payment Gateway creates the hash in the same way on our side and sends it
  back in the XML.
- The Shared Secret should always remain on the server-side and must not be exposed
  to the public.
- Elavon Payment Gateway maintains separate endpoints for live and test transactions.
- HPP has two separate URLs for test and live.
- Customers must have JavaScript enabled on their browser for HPP to function correctly.
- The Timestamp returned in the response will be identical to the one sent in the
  request POST.
- Check the other transaction variables against what was stored in your application
  at the time the request POST was sent.
- Merchants who accept customer card data directly using the API should be aware of
  their PCI DSS compliance responsibilities.
- Your Shared Secret should always remain on the server side and must not be exposed
  to the public.
