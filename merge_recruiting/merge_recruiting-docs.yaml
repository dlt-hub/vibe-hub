auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.merge.dev/ats/:
  - Token-based authentication using Bearer tokens in the Authorization header, with
    an additional X-Account-Token header required for Linked Account-specific data
    requests. The Authorization header requires the prefix "Bearer" followed by a
    production API key, and the X-Account-Token header contains a token identifying
    the end user.
  - 'Token-based authentication using Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer {token}" with every request to Merge''s Unified
    API.'
- information_source; https://docs.merge.dev/basics/integration-metadata/:
  - This endpoint requires API key authentication. The API key must be sent with requests
    (never store it in your frontend) and is used to authenticate organization-specific
    integration queries. Refer to the authentication documentation for the specific
    header name and format required to include the API key.
- information_source; https://docs.merge.dev/basics/pagination/:
  - This API uses two authentication methods sent in HTTP headers. The X-Account-Token
    header carries a Linked Account Token, and the Authorization header uses Bearer
    token authentication with a Production API Key. Both credentials must be included
    in requests to paginated endpoints.
- information_source; https://docs.merge.dev/guides/testing-via-postman/:
  - Merge API uses Bearer Token authentication. Insert your Merge production key in
    the Authorization header with type "Bearer Token". The key can be stored as a
    variable (e.g., `api-key`) in Postman for reuse across requests and environments.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.merge.dev/basics/pagination/:
  - Pagination uses `cursor` (optional, query parameter) and `page_size` (query parameter)
    to navigate results. The `next` and `previous` cursors returned in responses indicate
    where to point the `cursor` parameter for subsequent requests. Keep all other
    query parameters consistent across paginated requests. Stop paginating when `next`
    or `previous` is null.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with `cursor` query parameter (optional)
    for positioning and `page_size` query parameter (optional, defaults to 30, max
    100) to control results per request. Response includes `next` and `previous` cursor
    fields; when either is null, no more pages exist in that direction. Pass the `next`
    or `previous` cursor value from a response as the `cursor` parameter in the subsequent
    request.
