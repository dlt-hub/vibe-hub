auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.smsportal.com/docs/quickstart:
  - 'The RESTful API supports two authentication methods. First, Basic HTTP Authentication
    using API credentials: BASE64 encode your ClientID and APISecret in the format
    ClientID:APISecret and include in the Basic Authentication Header. Second, Token-Based
    Authentication: BASE64 encode ClientID:APISecret and send to the /authentication
    endpoint to generate a 24-hour AEG Token, then use that token in subsequent API
    requests. All requests must use HTTPS. API credentials (ClientID and APISecret)
    are created and managed in the SMSPortal Control Panel and should be kept secure.'
- information_source; https://docs.smsportal.com/docs/rest-best-practices:
  - Implement Basic Authentication or Token-based authentication for all API requests.
    Pass credentials either as Basic Authentication (username and password encoded
    in Base64) or as a generated Token in the Authorization header with every request
    to the REST API.
- information_source; https://docs.smsportal.com/reference/authentication:
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Generate a token by BASE64 encoding your
    API credentials as "ClientID:APISecret" and sending them in the Basic Authentication
    Header. Tokens are valid for 24 hours and must be regenerated after expiration.
