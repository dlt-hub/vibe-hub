- API blocking serves as a crucial security measure employed by organizations to safeguard
  their systems from unauthorized access, prevent misuse, and maintain service integrity.
- API blocking enhances security by preventing unauthorized access, enforcing rate
  limits to ensure fair usage, and mitigating risks such as data scraping, credential
  stuffing, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
- Browser profiles require a graphical user interface to function properly
- To use the API, you need an automation token.
- The token expires in 30 minutes.
