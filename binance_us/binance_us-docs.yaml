auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.binance.us/:
  - API key and secret key authentication using HMAC SHA256. The api_key and secret_key
    parameters are passed to the binanceus_request function, which constructs the
    request with a timestamp parameter (in milliseconds). The request is signed using
    HMAC SHA256 with the secret_key.
  - API key authentication is required via the X-MBX-APIKEY header. Send your API
    key in the X-MBX-APIKEY header when making requests to create or manage user data
    streams. The listenKey obtained from the stream creation endpoint is then used
    to access WebSocket streams at /ws/<listenKey> or /stream?streams=<listenKey>.
  - API key authentication is required. Send your API key in the `X-MBX-APIKEY` header
    for all requests to the user data stream endpoints. The `listenKey` parameter
    must also be provided in the request body or query parameters depending on the
    HTTP method used.
  - API key authentication via X-MBX-APIKEY header combined with HMAC SHA256 request
    signing. Send the API key in the X-MBX-APIKEY header, and include a signature
    parameter (in query string or request body) computed as HMAC SHA256 of totalParams
    using your secret key, with signature parameter name being signature.
  - API key authentication via custom header X-MBX-APIKEY, combined with HMAC SHA256
    signature-based request signing. The api_key goes in the X-MBX-APIKEY header,
    the api_secret is used to generate an HMAC SHA256 signature of the request data,
    and the signature is included as a "signature" parameter in the request payload
    alongside other data parameters like quoteId and timestamp.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.binance.us/:
  - 'Pagination for Get Trades uses optional query parameters: limit (default 500,
    max 1000) to control page size, and fromId (optional) to specify the trade ID
    to start from. Response includes an array of trades; to get the next page, use
    the ID of the last trade from the current response as the next fromId parameter.'
  - The Get Staking History endpoint uses query parameter pagination with page and
    limit parameters. The page parameter specifies which page to retrieve, and limit
    controls the number of results per page. Both are optional query parameters in
    the request URL.
  - The `GET /api/v3/klines` endpoint supports pagination through the limit parameter,
    which is optional with a default of 500 and maximum of 1000. Pagination is achieved
    by using startTime and endTime parameters to specify time ranges for retrieving
    kline bars; if neither is provided, the most recent klines are returned.
  - The endpoint supports offset-based pagination using query parameters page (page
    number, optional, no maximum) and limit (records per page, optional, default 10,
    maximum 100). Include both parameters in the request to retrieve specific pages
    of results.
  - The endpoint supports pagination via a limit parameter (query string, optional,
    default 20, maximum 500). The response includes a total field indicating total
    records. No explicit next page or cursor mechanism is described; pagination appears
    to rely on the limit parameter alone without offset or continuation tokens.
