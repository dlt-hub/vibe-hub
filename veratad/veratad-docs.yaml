notes:
- Whenever the test_key attribute is sent with a valid value then those transactions
  are not billable.
- Testing transactions are not billable when the test_key attribute is sent with a
  valid value.
- You are limited to 1,000 requests per minute to the create session endpoint.
- VX will fire a webhook to your defined endpoint after each components execution
  through the journey.
- VX uses device fingerprinting to link sessions back to the same device.
- The iFrame will post messages to the parent window based on specific events that
  occur during the verification process.
- VX uses device fingerprinting to link sessions back to the same device, even when
  a person rotates emails, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information.
- Use the test_key attribute to test the service.
- Make sure to set the allow properly in case one of your verification components
  needs access
- Service testing is done with the live data source. Veratad will provide you with
  an amount of free transactions for testing purposes.
- To access live data do not send the test_key attribute.
- Service name must include the country name as per the coverage section.
- Test key can be used for testing purposes.
- Requires a valid Veratad username and password for authentication.
- Initial call to /process/comprehensive/gateway returns a quiz.
- Second call to /process/continue submits answers for scoring.
- The AgeMatch 5.0 Estimate API provides an estimate of the age based on a provided
  selfie.
- The token is only valid for 90 seconds by default.
- Use the test_key attribute to test the service. When the test_key is provided the
  system will dynamically drop the live data sources and use the testing database.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Responses may vary based on identity attributes provided
- IDR Calc is Veratad's patented process that allows the user to sum up at least two
  digits from their SSN to prove they know the variable without collecting sensitive
  PII.
- A PASS will still occur if the only issue is ADDRESS DISCREPANCY.
- The service name must match the value in the international coverage section.
- The service name should match the value in the international coverage section.
- The test_key allows dynamic testing without using live data.
- IDMatchPredict5.0.FraudScore assesses the overall risk of an applicant for a new
  account.
- Each token is only valid for 90 seconds with this service.
- IDMatchPredict5.0.FraudScore will process with the default base ruleset unless a
  different rule set is specified in the query.
- When the test_key is provided the system will dynamically drop the live data sources
  and use the testing database.
- This service is asynchronous and requires two requests for completion.
- This service is asynchronous and may involve multiple requests.
- The service requires a first name, last name, and phone number on input to process.
- This service will continue to search sources until that goal can either be confirmed
  or denied.
- The service only requires a first name, last name, and phone number on input to
  process.
- The number should be a string with the country code followed by the number.
- If you send the number with any characters that is fine. They will be stripped out.
- This service is asynchronous
- The total payload may not exceed 10 MB in size.
- The minimum image size is 400 pixels on each side of the document.
- The total payload of the initial request cannot be greater than 10mb in size.
- The majority of manual reviews will take 90 seconds to complete, but this is not
  guaranteed.
- The total payload of the initial request can not be greater than 10mb in size.
- Tokens are only valid for 6 hours.
