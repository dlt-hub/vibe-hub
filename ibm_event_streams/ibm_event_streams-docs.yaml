auth_info:
- information_source; https://ibm.github.io/event-automation/es/connecting/rest-api/:
  - The Producer API supports two authentication methods. For Basic authentication,
    include an Authorization header with the value "Basic <auth_token>" where auth_token
    is a previously generated Basic authentication token. For SCRAM authentication,
    use HTTP Basic auth by passing the SCRAM username and password via the -u flag
    (e.g., -u <user>:<password>), which automatically sets the Authorization header.
    Both methods work with HTTPS endpoints; use HTTP if TLS is disabled on the endpoint.
- information_source; https://ibm.github.io/event-automation/es/es_11.7/connecting/rest-api/:
  - 'Basic authentication or SCRAM authentication is required. For Basic auth, pass
    the generated token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic <auth_token>".
    For SCRAM auth, use the -u flag with username and password in the format <user>:<password>.
    Both methods support optional TLS certificate verification via --cacert parameter.'
