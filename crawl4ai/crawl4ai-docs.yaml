  - 'API keys for LLM providers must be configured via environment variables in a
    .llm.env file located in the project root directory. Provider-specific keys (e.g.,
    OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) are required depending on which LLM provider
    is used. Configuration can be overridden per-request via API request parameters
    including provider, temperature, and base_url fields. The hierarchical priority
    is: API request parameters (highest), provider-specific environment variables,
    then global environment variables (lowest).'
