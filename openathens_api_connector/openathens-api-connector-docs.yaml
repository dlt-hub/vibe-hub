notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Minimum TLS version is 1.2.
- Requires user setup for OAuth2.
- Rate limits may apply.
- Your administrator account can get banned by the system and would need to be re-enabled
  by another administrator user.
- If you are the only administrator account holder, you should consider using a different
  (non-admin) account for resource access.
- Accounts with an administrator role cannot be updated by bulk operations and are
  not sent expiry warning emails.
- Accounts with an administrator role cannot be modified by bulk operations or be
  sent expiry warning emails.
- An administrator account can get banned by the system and would need to be re-enabled
  by another administrator user.
- Accounts that are blocked due to rules you have put in place on a local connection
  cannot be re-enabled this way.
- User needs to be authenticated for requests.
- Using API for user authentication is flexible but does not work with local accounts.
- OpenAthens will always pass a targeted ID for a user.
- OpenAthens will pass all roles specified on permission sets that are assigned to
  a user.
- OpenAthens will pass entitlements specified on permission sets to the resources
  connected with those entitlements.
- Username must be limited to English characters only.
- Bulk uploads will reject fields that are too large.
- Integrating your local directory allows you to use existing credentials from your
  own systems instead of creating accounts via the administration interface.
- Changes won't appear until the next time a user signs in, so if you're testing this
  you may need to sign out.
- Published configurations cannot be unpublished and deleted cards cannot be recovered.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in OpenAthens
- Some endpoints may have rate limiting
- Users must enter at least one piece of contact information out of phone number,
  email address, or website URL.
- The latitude and longitude of your organisation's location(s) can be recorded on
  your organisation account as an aid to organisation discovery.
- For existing customers, release Pairwise-ID to resources on a case by case basis
  when they announce support and migration.
- Resources should be updating to support Pairwise-ID but it may take some time before
  they all do.
- Passing blank cells under 'permissionSets' will remove the permission sets from
  that account.
- Removing all permission sets from an account may prevent access to resources.
- This is a little more advanced as you will have to add a permission set name to
  cells in a spreadsheet that may already have data in them and you will need more
  spreadsheet skills.
- You should not remove them from your default release policy as this is likely to
  break access for your users.
- Check your local laws, policies and user-agreements before releasing additional
  attributes.
- If you remove the default attributes from your global policy you may lose access
  to content.
- This is your data, so marking user-specific data as reportable is your decision
- This is your data, so marking user-specific data as reportable is your responsibility
  - you need to comply with all relevant privacy and data protection legislation
- The reportable flag on an attribute is on or off for your entire domain so will
  affect all your users
- Since choice 1 will lead to reports that do not include all users, it is possible
  that the reports you get may not be able to do what you need them to do so option
  2 is recommended in most cases
- Typos can really muddle things up in the report interface - fixing them will not
  change data that has already been recorded
- Can be left blank (usually a disadvantage)
- You have to get the data in there for any existing accounts
- Restrictive mode was developed as a means of dealing with the occasional federated
  resource that required the identity provider to only respond for authorised users.
- Making the 'no access' message the same for all the resources you don't subscribe
  to - the user gets a consistent message from OpenAthens instead of different messages
  from the publishers.
- Removing resources you do not subscribe to from statistics - because of how federated
  access works, we cannot tell if the resource let the user in or not, so we count
  that the user was transferred to the resource.
- Restrictive mode is a per-organisation setting and is set on the Account preferences
  page (Preferences > Account).
- Once you save the page the change will take a few minutes to propagate to our authentication
  points.
- If you have made changes to the choices available in a custom attribute, or are
  planning to replace one custom attribute with another, you may need to migrate data
  using bulk operations.
- Both examples below represent a safe method that will work for any situation; specific
  situations may have simpler solutions.
- Disabling an attribute does not remove the data, but does prevent access to it.
- Deleting an attribute removes both the attribute and the data.
- The quick-search function allows you to quickly find accounts directly under you.
- Advanced search is designed to be more focused than quick-search.
- Deleted OpenAthens accounts (Personal, Access) are recoverable for up to 30 days
  during which time the username cannot be re-issued and the associated email address
  cannot be added to another account.
- Accounts can be associated with only one group at a time.
- Deleted accounts appear on their own tab of search results for up to 30 days at
  which point the system permanently deletes them.
- Our team can build a registration page for you according to the information you
  give us.
- Once the specification is agreed, we will have a first release for you to test in
  3 weeks (for standard builds). You will then have 2 weeks to test it meets expectations
  - defects will be fixed within 5 working days.
- The session lasts up to eight hours or until the browser is closed.
- If you have multiple organisations that will appear, you should make sure that they
  have different enough names that users can select the correct one.
- If you set a local connection as default you cannot use any other connectors.
- If a user fails to authenticate at your login, the AP will stop remembering they
  are from your organisation.
- Anything that clears cookies or local storage will mean the AP forgets the user
  too.
- The Cloudflare service has been observed to sometimes mis-identify the OpenAthens
  Proxy as a robot or malicious agent and block access.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Usernames must be unique and are not case sensitive.
- Usernames must be at least 6 characters long and can be as long as 20 characters.
- Password length must be between 10 and 100 characters and pass a strength assessment.
- Passwords are case sensitive, and just about any character from any language is
  fine - if it's on the keyboard you're using it should be ok.
- The safest way to reset user passwords is to trigger an activation email and let
  the account holder do it themselves.
- Dates and times are UTC rather than where the home organisation is, or where the
  user might appear to be.
- This page is about the link generator.
- Ping checks should be done a few times per hour.
- Load testing against the infrastructure is not allowed.
- Link checkers should limit the number of threads to less than 100 checks per minute.
- OpenAthens only needs a name and an email address to create an account for a user.
- It is good practice to not store any of your users' personal data that you do not
  need.
- A simple set-up where everyone has access to everything needs only one permission
  set.
- If the resource is not redirectable but only bypassable, the access URL will be
  used and the user can only be sent to the general sign-in page rather than the specified
  target page.
- It can take up to 14 hours for changes to take full effect.
- Accounts with administrator roles can still access resources.
- If your account is the only one with the owner role, then no one else at your organisation
  will be able to help you reset your password if lost or forgotten.
- OpenAthens can interact with many third-party applications.
- You cannot delete a sub-organisation that has its own sub-organisations, so you
  will need to take care of those first.
- This delete operation is permanent and cannot be undone.
- To disable accounts, use the DELETE method on the accounts endpoint.
- You can remove permission sets or expire accounts to disable them.
- Setting today's date as the expiry date will stop the account from working.
- Downloads usually contain information that could be considered sensitive or personal
  by the account holders.
- If it starts with 192.168.x.x or with 10.x.x.x or any of 172.16.x.x through 172.31.x.x
  are called private address spaces and they're reserved for internal network traffic.
- If it looks anything like 123.123.123.0/24, this format with a slash in it is called
  CIDR notation and the /24 is describing how much of the address is fixed.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Access account credentials are submitted in the same way as any other OpenAthens
  account.
- Some federations do not permit shared accounts and require that all users be uniquely
  identifiable.
- You control the entityID and scopes associated with your organisation.
- When you move existing users from OpenAthens accounts to using a local connector,
  the identifier that they present to a resource is changed.
- In most cases this does not make any difference to their experience in the resource,
  but in some cases it can cause your users to lose saved settings.
- You can maintain the end-users' original identifier by passing an additional attribute
  for these users.
- The reports automatically aggregate on Days, Months, Permission sets, User groups.
- Some reports also aggregate on Hours, Country, Network.
- Values for custom attributes are case sensitive.
- 'Permission set names contain a # symbol.'
- If you delete the mapping, everything is deleted including any manual changes to
  the account. This includes permission sets, notes, status and whether it is disabled.
  When the account next logs in it will be enabled, have a fresh created date, and
  will be using permission sets based on the rules you have set up.
- In some cases it is possible to use the move action to move an account to a sub-administrator
  that your login cannot itself access.
- The file-based bulk upload option is more flexible and powerful.
- You can't change unique fields such as name or email, account expiry dates, permission
  sets, groups, yes/no attributes, or anything on accounts with an administrator role.
- An API key is required.
- Ensure API key is not exposed to the end user.
- The returnUrl must be to your own application or page.
- Local connections such as LDAP and ADFS will, by default, assume that any account
  that gets past your own authentication is OK.
- Permission sets or suspend rules would then be applied.
- This is known as pre-mapping and is done in two steps.
- Doing it in this order is suggested, but not required.
- From the moment you save, only users that have previously signed in will be able
  to gain access.
- Previously unseen users will be denied access until you complete the next step.
- Make sure that at least one user has logged in before you change from automatic
  to manual.
- Unless you use the specify a password now option, sending a new code will not disable
  an already activated account.
- Sending a code will not force a user to change their password.
- Accounts can be recovered for up to 30 days after deletion.
- When an account is deleted and still showing on the deleted tab you will not be
  able to re-use the username and in some cases email address until that account has
  been permanently deleted.
- Events such as an unactivated account reaching the delete unactivated accounts threshold
  will cause the account to be permanently deleted whichever tab it's under.
- Administrator enabled accounts can only be reset in the admin area.
- If your account has the 'owner' role, only another owner will be able to help you.
- If you are the only owner, you should make a note of your pin in case you need to
  contact the service desk by telephone.
- To enable redirection after account activation, update domain preferences by adding
  a URL in the after account activation section.
- This page covers the use of Squid in a multi-tenant situation.
- You will need to talk to us before you start so that we can prepare the additional
  files you will need.
- Ensure inbound connection is limited to OpenAthens using an X.509 client certificate.
- The external IP address of your Squid instance must be configured.
- Both certificates should be placed in the appropriate ssl_cert folder.
- Only root should have RW access to the server.pem file.
- This page covers the use of Squid as a single tenant - i.e. with only one IP address.
- No fear of the command line (although a healthy respect is always good)
- Modern RHEL and Debian based distros now both use systemctl so are the same.
- Remove any and all http_port directives, leaving only the https_port directive
- Server's certificate needs to be from a valid certification authority or Let's Encrypt
- Only root should have RW access to the server.pem file
- Setup for all parties is easier when they are in a common federation. We're in the
  OpenAthens federation.
- In order for an OpenAthens user to access a resource, the resource needs to be in
  the permission set associated with the username, and the relevant identifiers for
  your organisation need to be registered by the service provider.
- You will need domain / owner level access to the OpenAthens admin area
- If you use restrictive mode you will need to add this resource to the permission
  set(s) used by the users you have authorised on the service
- You will need to be able to release some attributes that you would not usually release,
  such as an email address, so relevant users must have data in those fields
- 'You have registered for the certificate service via: https://www.jisc.ac.uk/certificate-service'
- The field must be populated for the authorised users of the certificate service.
- Attribute names are case sensitive.
- Self managed controls which locations can be registered from
- Self managed controls which email addresses can be used
- Applies from next user registration
- With local connectors, debug mode can only show incoming attributes from SAML based
  sources, not things like the API or LDAP.
- If you have only one local connection and it is LDAP or SirsiDynix, you will not
  see the popup because these connection types can accept OpenAthens accounts.
- If the request and response use SAML 2 the key attributes are passed using the *urn:oid*
  format.
- Usernames are limited to the ISO-8859-1 character set so cannot be generated if
  the user's first or last name has any other characters.
- The three digit number is a fixed component, so there is a limit of 999 accounts
  that can generate the same combination of letters.
- You should use at least two factor authentication for your local users (e.g. username
  and password, barcode and pin).
- IdP initiated logins are not necessary because any time an end-user ends up at an
  OpenAthens authentication point without an OpenAthens session, they can start one.
- It will not work as you might expect, and probably won't work at all.
- The relay state (or return URL) is where to return the end-user after establishing
  a session and should be a location in your own application or portal that is expecting
  the user to be sent there.
- The SAML standard requires this location to be consistent and opaque to your end-users,
  it also imposes a maximum size of 80 bytes.
- A common misconception is that the return URL or relay state can be the WAYFless
  or redirector URLs that would otherwise appear in your portal.
- To run old and new in parallel you will need to register a second entityID with
  any federations you are part of and give it a different display name so your users
  can tell the difference.
- Using the same scope is ok.
- Your resources may not grant the second entityID access until you ask them to.
- The main concern with this method is usually that your users will present different
  targetedIDs to service providers when they are associated with the new entityID
  so will be seen as different people which means personalisations such as saved searches
  or alerts can be lost.
- If your users presenting different identifiers to service providers would be problematic,
  you may prefer to keep the same entityID.
- If your users presenting different identifiers to service providers is not a major
  issue for you, then simply asking the service providers to update your entityID
  and scope in their records to your new values can be a simple approach.
- Some service providers linked the user via a scoped version of targetedID.
- Codes can only be used once and must be used within an hour (from the time they're
  generated).
- Select 'Redirect' rather than 'Post' for binding.
- Uses OAuth2 - requires setup of connected app in OpenAthens
- Not all service providers are able to support this, so you should discuss it with
  them before setting it up.
- This attribute should not be used to send information that could enable the identification
  of specific users.
- OpenAthens keeps users signed in for up to 8 hours.
- Some users will belong to more than one organisation that uses OpenAthens though.
- Users will be transferred to your local login page as soon as we know that they
  are yours.
- From time to time the certificates used to secure communications between you and
  us need to be updated. Usually because they are nearing their expiry date.
- This usually only happens every 10 years or so
- Updates must be in place before Monday 3 February 2025 for the signing certificate.
- If you additionally encrypt responses you will need to update that certificate by
  Monday 24 February.
- What to do when a certificate changes
- Updating the certificate used by custom SAML resources
- Updates must be in place before Monday 3 February 2025
- Will require updating all custom SAML resources.
- OpenAthens’ certificates have a ten-year lifetime.
- The current certificate expires in February 2025.
- It's only SAML based local connectors that are affected.
- If your local directory (or 1:1 resource) can support multiple certificates, then
  use both old and new alongside each other. You can remove the old one after it expires.
- If your local directory (or 1:1 resource) can only support one certificate at a
  time, you will need to make the updates on the date of the change (12:00 UTC 3 February
  2025).
- Most networks are not configured to block unspecified sites by default, but if you
  cannot access the administration pages or resources you may need to pass this data
  to your network team to enable access.
- The specific IP addresses frequently change so adding the hostnames to an allow
  list is the only practical solution.
- OpenAthens LA was our locally installed authentication product which connected to
  ActiveDirectory and used the user credentials you were already maintaining for authentication
  so you would not need to create or manage separate accounts.
- All support for it ended on 31 March 2020. OpenAthens LA has been superseded by
  local connector functionality.
- AthensDA is no longer available and you should check out our local connectors.
- Federated access is optimised for OpenAthens and usually provides the best user
  experience.
- Proxy access does not require the service provider to enable remote access.
- If you are an end user, you should contact your administrator.
- You can look up their chosen contact details via the forgotten password page.
- If the user frequently has to sign in again, they may be blocking or clearing the
  OpenAthens session cookie.
- Redirector links are customer specific - using links from a different OpenAthens
  organisation will present the user with a login page.
- If the user selects the wrong organisation in a WAYF they'll be presented with a
  login page.
- If you have customised the email templates, it is worth considering whether the
  user would recognise them for what they are.
- You can also introduce problems yourself if you copy text into the email template
  from a word processor as that can include hidden tags or markup that can stop the
  email being sent.
- In most cases, making sure `*.openathens.net` isn’t blocked will be sufficient,
  especially for end users.
- If your end-users tend to have personal emails rather than your own it is worth
  checking the email templates for text that may trigger filtering.
- If it is your own mail server, then it may also need to know that the emails come
  from servers at `mail1.openathens.net` or `*.mailjet.com` with return paths of `@openathens.net`
  or `@bnc3.openathens.net`.
- If you cannot see the error that is stopping you, scroll the page to see every error
  when there is more than one.
- If you have errors on more than one page of a dialog the system will not be able
  to show you both at the same time.
- Email address must be unique when used as a username.
- If reusing an email address, untick the option to use email as username on the conflicting
  account.
- 'It will usually appear within minutes so the things to check are: Have you checked
  both the live and visible boxes on the details tab? Are you looking at the correct
  organisation at the authentication point? If you have not changed the username and
  password labels, it may not look any different from the OpenAthens sign-in page
  - try signing in.'
- 'It will usually appear within minutes, but the effect you are looking for is that
  as soon as the organisation is known (selecting from the search box will do) the
  user is taken directly to your own login. The things to check are: Have you checked
  both the live, visible and default boxes on the details tab? Are you looking at
  the correct organisation at the authentication point? If you are being sent anywhere
  at all, the authentication point is doing its job so the problem will most likely
  be with your own login page or your browser''s connection to it. If you are running
  more than one connection and want both to appear, make sure none of them are marked
  as default (live and visible should be on).'
- 'They are triggering more rules than you expect, or a rule is assigning more permission
  sets. Things to check are: First check that you haven''t manually assigned permission
  sets to the account. If the default permission sets rule is active, check if any
  other permission sets have been flagged as default. If you are allocating permission
  set by passing the name in an attribute or claim: Check the data in your directory
  is correct. If you are passing a multi-valued attribute, all values will be assigned.
  Have you used a ''does not contain'' operator on a multi-valued attribute?'
- The most common reason for rules not behaving as expected is to do with multi-valued
  attributes such as memberOf.
- This will happen when mapping rules are set up such that the user isn't mapped to
  any organisation.
- Troubleshooting users repeatedly being asked to sign in
- If users keep having to sign in, check if it happens on all browsers and devices.
- If it happens only on one device, it may be due to clearing or blocking cookies.
- If it happens on all devices on your network, it may be due to IT settings.
- If it happens everywhere, there may be an issue on the service's end.
- Check the service status page for updates.
- If you do not get as far as seeing the sign-in page, you will need to speak to your
  networks team.
- If you are waiting for but do not receive an email with an access code, it may have
  been mistakenly identified as spam.
- We RECOMMEND using SAML 2.0
- A SAML 2.0 metadata document MUST be made available via a URL or xml file
- Metadata MUST contain an *<md:IDPSSODescriptor>* element
- Metadata SHOULD NOT contain an *<md:SPSSODescriptor>* element
- The *urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient* name identifier format
  MUST be supported
- A persistent user identifier attribute MUST be passed to OpenAthens as part of the
  attribute statement. This value MUST be consistent for a given user account between
  different logins.
- When receiving a SAML request (*<saml2p:AuthnRequest>*) from OpenAthens the *HTTP-REDIRECT*
  binding MUST be supported
- SAML responses (*<saml2p:Response>*) to OpenAthens MUST be sent using the *HTTP-POST*
  binding and MUST be signed
- Additional attributes MAY be passed to us as part of the attribute statement to
  categorise users within OpenAthens
- Create a special permission set and call it something distinctive such as 'test1'
- Allocate the relevant resource to the permission set
- Manually set the password for the test account, and give it a short expiry date
- Change the password of the test account before passing it to a different publisher
- It can be up to five minutes (typically less) before changes to permission sets
  take effect, so test the test account via MyAthens before passing it on.
- OpenAthens can usually be run independently of the IT team should you choose to
  do so.
- If you are restricting secure traffic, you will need to allow certain hostnames.
- Federated resources require targetedID of the user and a sign-in timestamp.
- Proxy resources require timestamps and URLs for user actions.
- NHS England has special functions to address unique needs.
- Ensure to set up OAuth2 credentials in your OpenAthens account.
- Account type - usually a personal account (one per user) but may sometimes be an
  Access account (can be shared - good for walk-in users or training).
- Account status - whether it is eligible or ineligible to access subscription content
  after logging in.
- NHS England domain administrator can set grace period duration for account expiry
- Activation code expiry on organisation change is separate from manual account creation
  expiry
- Ensure necessary permissions are granted for API access.
- API requires authentication to access data
- Ensure to check the API documentation for rate limits
- OpenAthens is a tool used for institutional access.
- If you are not a member of a participating organisation, you cannot get an OpenAthens
  account.
- A great many resources work with OpenAthens.
- There are far too many to show here, but there is a complete list maintained at
  https://www.openathens.net/compatible-providers/
- This API requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Items under Accounts menu relate to the creation and management of accounts.
- Mapped data will be automatically cleared after 365 days of not being seen
- You can set a lower limit on the connection if needed
- Just like personal accounts, misuse monitoring is in place and admin accounts can
  find themselves banned.
- If you have more than 5,000 accounts to upload you will need to split the upload
  into batches.
- Even though you can specify passwords in the upload, it's a bad idea for all kinds
  of reasons. Set accounts to pending and email user to true - this will let your
  patrons choose their own secure passwords.
- Computers are famously literal and they will try to do exactly what it thinks you
  are telling it to. Care must be taken in certain areas.
- The permission set column, if included on a modify upload, must include any permission
  sets you want the account to keep because leaving this filed blank will remove all
  permission sets from the specified account. Similarly the allowEmailLogin can remove
  a desired option if left blank.
- 'Mandatory fields - some are mandatory only in combination with others - e.g. on
  an account creation upload: password is only mandatory if you''re setting status
  as ''active''. Some fields are mandatory on creation uploads, but not on update
  uploads. The template will tell you.'
- If you're sending a modify upload based on a data download - the best way to avoid
  problems on a modify upload is to remove any columns that are not the username and
  are not changing any data.
- Character set - the upload needs to be in the ISO-8859-1 character set which means
  that some characters will not be accepted - examples are ï ¿ ½ (and curly apostrophes).
- Usernames - if you want to specify usernames, they will need to start with your
  prefix and be unique.
- Requires setup of connected app in OpenAthens.
- To avoid problems with how different countries format dates, upload and download
  files always use yyyy-MM-dd.
- Specifying passwords in an upload is discouraged but if you find that you must then
  they each need to be unique and adhere to some complexity requirements.
- 'You cannot blank fields via bulk upload (with one exception: permission sets).'
- Performs a pre-set search for accounts where the user has not yet set a password
  and / or confirmed their email address.
- Items in this menu relate to resources and their allocation via the catalogue into
  permission sets.
- Be sure your target links are clear of any sensitive information such as username
  or password parameters.
- Links that contain passwords are rejected.
- Whilst all accounts will need at least one permission set so that they can access
  resources, restricting access to the resources specified in a permission set requires
  restrictive mode be set to on.
- Permission set descriptions do not have to be unique, but it helps.
- Resource statistics are aggregated against all permission sets that a user has,
  even the ones that don't contain that resource. This may affect your strategy.
- Some federated resources require different settings for roles or entitlements to
  allow your users access and these are usually controlled by permission sets.
- If you only have one permission set and need different values for these attributes,
  you will need to use additional permission sets to give users the other roles and
  entitlements settings.
- Whilst resources could deduce a role of 'member' when they are passed roles such
  as staff or student, this is not necessarily universal. The solution is to create
  and apply a permission set with the member attribute to all users.
- Custom resources do not appear in reports unless the access URL goes through the
  authentication point.
- Titles are limited to 100 characters, descriptions to 2000, and URLs to 512.
- Custom SAML resources were developed for SSO to things like your VLE, G Suite or
  Adobe Creative Cloud.
- SAML 1.x is not supported for this kind of connection.
- Every few years we have to update a security certificate which will affect these
  connections and require an update at the resource end.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Before allocating a new resource to permission sets, check the access URL and test
  it.
- Resources outside of the OpenAthens federation may not have direct access.
- When an account leaves your control or is permanently deleted you will no longer
  be able to access its details or its activity stream.
- Some attributes can have multiple values for a single user. When analysing these
  attributes, the total count can be higher than the number of users because each
  user action is counted for every applicable value.
- A good example are permission sets, where the key connection is the user, not the
  resource.
- Reports can be scheduled to run daily, weekly or monthly.
- Monthly and weekly schedules are available on all reports, but some do not allow
  the daily option.
- Reports on a daily schedule will use an hourly granularity, the others will use
  daily.
- The process that aggregates the data works in arrears - one hour for hourly aggregations
  and two for others.
- Reports are kept for 4 years or until your domain is deleted, whichever is sooner.
- Items in this menu relate to the configurable items such as default expiry dates.
- Data protection regulations that apply in the countries where OpenAthens store and
  process the data mean there can be no option to never delete expired accounts.
- Accounts deleted by this operation are not recoverable.
- If you create or edit the text in an external editor such as a word processor and
  paste it in, you will find that various bits of otherwise hidden information such
  as hyperlinks and formatting tags can be included and these can cause problems ranging
  from unexpected fonts appearing in the emails to activation links not working or
  emails not being sent at all.
- For best results you should edit in the browser (most modern browsers include spell
  checking for that kind of text window) but if you have crafted your text in an external
  editor you should do one of the following things to avoid problems when you paste
  it in.
- Not all fields will be available on all emails
- Personalised greeting. Organisation specific support instructions, including an
  activation URL that you should not edit.
- These reminders, if enabled, are sent at 30 and 15 days before expiry.
- Best not to change the email part of this
- If you have modified an email template you will see a return arrow button has appeared
  next to the save button, and the icon in the list is dark instead of light.
- Clicking the return arrow will reset the template to the default unless you have
  another organisation above yours with a customised template.
- If you are in a hierarchy and the organisation above you has customised the email
  template, the return to default button will use that customised template as your
  default
- The return to default option will instantly overwrite any customisations.
- When users are passed directly to the resource due to bypass zones, they do not
  pass though the authentication point. This means no statistics are recorded.
- Changes here are affected by the cache times of two separate components, so could
  take as much as 14 hours to become live.
- Changes to bypass zones or resource exceptions do not apply immediately and it can
  take up to 14 hours for changes to go live.
- You are responsible for ensuring you comply with all local rules and legislation
  relating to the release of this kind of data.
- Per resource policies completely override the default policy and must include all
  required attributes
- By default, all attributes in the default policy will be released to any service
  provider in the federation that the user tries to access where there is no per-resource
  policy defined, including those that you do not subscribe to.
- You are responsible for ensuring compliance with local rules and legislation relating
  to sharing user data.
- Changes won't appear until the next time a user signs in.
- Published configurations cannot be unpublished.
- Requires setup of ADFS metadata URL
- Connection can only be used in debug mode if not live and visible
- If you are migrating from a product that normalised the user identifier it received
  from LDAP, you will want to do the same with ADFS if you are intending to keep personalisations
  by maintaining the end-user's targetedIDs.
- You no longer need to use the method detailed below, but we've left it here in case
  it's useful or if you prefer to add a custom rule to the claims issuance policy.
- Unfortunately ADFS rules don't have commands such as lower or upper, or full regex
  support.
- ADFS step by step documentation available.
- On the older servers you may need to restart IIS if this is the first time ADFS
  set-up. ADFS 3 and above do not need IIS to be enabled.
- 'If you are planning to connect ADFS V2.0 to more than one OpenAthens domain you
  may need to apply Update Rollup 3: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2790338/description-of-update-rollup-3-for-active-directory-federation-service.'
- Supports TLS v1.2 or above as connections using older protocols will be rejected.
- The minimum supported TLS version is 1.2.
- Pseudonymous identifiers are recommended for the unique user attribute to avoid
  potential problems with data protection legislation.
- OpenAthens only permits secure LDAP connections.
- Usually these certificates are self-signed.
- The certificate OpenAthens needs is the root certificate of your LDAP server - i.e.
  the subject and issuer are the same as your server.
- If you have users who will be using OpenAthens accounts alongside users in your
  directory they will enter their details on this page too, so your labels should
  allow for this.
- Display name and unique user attribute should be set to 'bob' for initial save.
- Pseudonymous identifiers are recommended for the unique user attribute.
- Requires setup of connected app in OpenAthens
- Pseudonymous identifiers are recommended for the unique user attribute
- Connections from us will come from the following IP addresses (35.189.71.17 and
  35.224.184.162)
- Refer to the SirsiDynix Symphony API documentation for comprehensive information
  about the attributes.
- You are responsible for complying with all local policies and laws that may apply.
- You can have only have one rule of any type per target attribute.
- Any changes you save will go live almost immediately but do not affect users until
  the next time they sign in to OpenAthens.
- When you add a mapping to an existing schema attribute that is releasable, then
  the data in the local connection attributes you map becomes releasable too.
- When you remove a mapping, the data will no longer available to the system which
  has implications if anything is using it.
- Mapped data is truncated to fit when it is too large and this may become relevant
  if you are mapping to the username, forenames or surname attributes as those are
  limited to 20 characters.
- The data that is viewable here is not necessarily all the data held in your LDAP
  server for that user - what can be seen may be limited by restrictions your IT team
  have placed on the credentials used to read the data.
- Ensure to handle specific error codes during integration.
- Expired permission sets will still be assigned if they match any rule or are specified
  by attribute. It is recommended that you not set expiry dates on permission sets.
- 'When passing permission set names by attribute: if you pass a permission set name
  that does not exist in the same organisation as the user, they will not be applied
  and access may be affected.'
- The system has the facility to hold two certificates for a connected local authentication
  system to make it possible to transition between an expiring certificate and a new
  one without any break in service.
- You will need to add the second certificate at least a day before you replace the
  certificate on your local authentication source to ensure sufficient time for all
  systems to pick up the change.
- When a certificate is near to expiry, the system will automatically send you a reminder
  (30 days).
- It will keep sending reminders until you remove the old certificate (or it expires).
- Attributes need only be passed, they do not have to be otherwise mapped.
- Click the add suspend rule button to create rules.
- Once enabled, all users should be assigned to a single organisation by the rules.
- Any users that the rules do not assign to an organisation will not be able to sign
  in.
- It is important to set up rules to handle all users before saving changes.
- If users are mapped to anything other than one single organisation, an error will
  occur.
- You cannot use mapped targets or transformed values in transformations, only the
  names and values sent by your system
- You cannot further transform a value with another mapping or transformation
- You cannot use mapped or transformed values as conditions within another transformation
- When a rule looks at a multi-valued attribute, then all of the values are treated
  as discrete when evaluated for match conditions
- The OpenAthens local authentication API can be used to log your users into the system
  based on credentials stored in any system you can gain programmatic access to and
  is ideal in situations where you cannot use any of the other connection types.
- Evergreen does not support more than one active connection to OpenAthens at a time
  per organisation.
- At the moment there are three permission levels an API key can be given to restrict
  what it can do.
- When a key expires or is disabled, any application using it will receive invalid
  credentials errors from the API.
- All API operations follow a RESTful design pattern.
- The API currently implements only a subset of the functionality provided by the
  OpenAthens account management user-interface.
- Connections using TLS versions before 1.2 will be rejected.
- All access to the API is authenticated.
- Basic auth can no longer be used for administrator functions due to the multi-factor
  authentication requirement.
- API keys are long-lived authentication tokens that are associated with an OpenAthens
  domain or sub-organisation.
- The API entry point is the base URL for all operations.
- It is possible to add additional attributes to the schema for your domain.
- A client application must authenticate to the API as described in the documentation.
- Reminder - you cannot manage local accounts from your directory using the API, only
  OpenAthens accounts.
- Currently only personal account type is supported.
- The request must be accompanied with the ‘returnUrl’ parameter.
- Fetching raw statistics data via the API
- Raw reports are only available for the last 30 days.
- The report will only cover the organisation where the API key sits.
- All times and dates are UTC.
- Redirector API calls could fail under certain circumstances
- Significant updates and bug fixes have been made to various components of the API.
- Must be requested via the service desk.
- New authentication point at login.openathens.net.
- Support for multiple SAML/ADFS connections.
- Some endpoints may have specific access requirements
- Members shall permit OpenAthens to retain and publish the metadata described in
  the Federation Metadata section of this documentation.
- Members shall permit OpenAthens to publish members names for the purpose of marketing
  the OpenAthens Federation.
- Steps 1 - 3 are often replaced by a WAYFless URL (one that includes the IdP's entityID).
- The IdP should be expected to send a response for authenticated users, whether or
  not those users should have access to the SP's content - it's up to the SP to authorise
  access.
- All the interaction between the SP and IdP takes place via the user's browser over
  https
- If both the IdP and SP say in the metadata that they support encryption, then the
  SAML is also encrypted
- All OpenAthens IdPs support SAML 2 and encryption.
- IdPs can easily release role and entitlement attributes.
- Updates for additional identity providers must be kept up to date to avoid access
  issues.
- Join a federation in your home country for easier communication during the joining
  process.
- The 'Entitlement' value for a user is technically in common usage, but few service
  providers ask for it.
- Any software that is configured to support the SAML V2.0 deployment profile for
  federation interoperability should have no difficulty working within the OpenAthens
  federation.
- Identity providers SHOULD provide both eduPersonTargetedID attributes if required
  by a service provider.
- All OpenAthens IdPs can provide Pairwise-ID on request and those created after November
  2023 will do so by default.
- SAML 2.0 is RECOMMENDED.
- Back-channel is not supported by OpenAthens IdPs so MUST NOT be REQUIRED by SPs
  that only support SAML 1.1
- Implement a discovery service for users to select their organization.
- Support wayfless URLs for curated links.
- Deep linking (or article level linking) via authenticated links should be supported
  wherever possible as this is highly desirable to your customers.
- Where a logout function exists, it should be clear to the end-user that they have
  been logged out of your service.
- If your application supports it, you can check the ETag and avoid re-fetching unchanged
  metadata
- Extensions in the OpenAthens federation do not affect the transfer of users to resources.
- Certificates eventually expire and we will contact you in the months leading up
  to any change to let you know about it
- This certificate example is the one being made live on 3 February 2025 12:00 UTC
- 'Not Before: Apr 9 13:15:36 2024 UTC'
- 'Not After : Apr 9 13:15:36 2034 UTC'
- 'Serial number: 33e64f9cd5aef2c20b113d3cf08a36c34d80e715'
- Update your shibboleth2.xml file with a metadata provider
- Maximum 1 days cache time.
- If you encounter metadata loading issues you may need to increase the memory_limit
  and max_execution_time in your php configuration file.
- These attributes will be retired in the future and are provided only to help transition
  from older technologies.
- Must not be used for authorisation or persistence.
- Standard attributes in the OpenAthens federation can be used for authorisation.
- In a federation, the scope is used to identify organisations.
- Organisational units may need different subscription levels.
- You should neither expect nor require additional attributes due to data protection
  laws and other restraints.
- WAYFless access and deep linking are very popular with our mutual customers and
  you should support both where possible.
- When combined, deep linking and WAYFless access make your application compatible
  with most discovery services, library management systems and link resolvers (e.g.
  EBSCO EDS, ExLibris Alma/Primo, OVID LInkSolver) via our redirector, which allows
  the customer to put vanilla target links behind a consistent prefix and removes
  the need for proxy server masques.
- Pairwise-ID has been defined in the SAML specification as a replacement and simplification
  of TargetedID.
- OpenAthens IdPs created after November 2023 will release it by default.
- TargetedID is marked as depreciated in the SAML specification rather than end of
  life.
- By posting in the OpenAthens Ideas Portal, you consent to Jisc collecting your name
  and email in order to contact you for further feedback to help improve our products
  and services.
- MUST be OpenID Connect based on OAuth2 rather than plain OpenID.
- support daily key rotation
- OpenAthens Keystone is middleware that allows you to use OpenID Connect to participate
  in SAML federations.
- To use OpenID Connect, ensure the plugin specifically supports it.
- The redirect URL must match the address in the publisher dashboard.
- Assuming you're using Scope and targetedID, the preset rules will take care of things
  but they need to be turned on and this is done on the connection.
- You must not include domains that you do not own - they may be removed without notice.
- Any OpenID Connect framework should work without difficulty
- Requires setup of connected app in OpenAthens publisher dashboard
- This is sample code and is not production-ready
- Proper error handling is not implemented
- Authorisation is not implemented. This example shows how to obtain the claims necessary
  to authorise visiting users
- Users should now be able to select OpenAthens and Authenticate.
- Amazon Cognito integration should be complete and ready for testing.
- Ensure 'Enable automatic linking' is selected
- Ensure 'Update attributes for existing users' is selected
- Okta requires an email attribute and OpenAthens Identity Providers do not release
  an email address attribute as standard.
- Claims can be multi-valued and may be returned as either a string or an array.
- The .NET Framework implementation does not support fetching additional user claims
  from the userinfo endpoint.
- Uses OpenID Connect for authentication
- Default rules are pre-defined for mapping SAML attributes to OIDC claims.
- Some attributes can be multi-valued and will be sent as unordered arrays.
- Execution time is limited to one second. After this time the script is stopped and
  the login attempt will fail before the user is passed to you
- Any exceptions generated by your script will stop execution and the login attempt
  will fail before the user is passed to you
- There is information at the bottom of the page about changing the attribute names
  and values to suit your exact testing needs.
- Do not mess with anything outside of the attribute statement - the tester will reject
  invalid SAML.
- These claims may not be sent by default.
- Providing errorURL is mandatory for IdPs in some federations (e.g. InCommon) and
  optional in others; it is unlikely to be mandated that SPs use it, but federations
  are likely to encourage it as it will improve the UX when there are access problems.
- Rules are turned on or off on the connection, so if your old and new apps need contradictory
  rules, you my prefer to test the new application with its own connection before
  switching things about.
- The description and logo will appear for OpenAthens federation IdPs and in Wayfinder.
  This becomes mandatory when you want to go live in the OpenAthens federation
- The access URL will also become mandatory when you want to go live in the OpenAthens
  federation.
- Redirector URLs are WAYFless URLs with tokens for entityID and target.
- The publisher dashboard will require you to enter an access URL when you publish
  an entity in the OpenAthens federation.
- Scope checks are mandatory for attributes passed to the application.
- The only OpenID scope that needs to be specified for OpenAthens Keystone is 'openid'.
- Until you go live in a federation, Wayfinder will only show you a small number of
  entities and only your own will work for you.
- Different parts of the same customer entity can have different scopes.
- It is not easy to turn off the targetedID attribute with OpenAthens.
- Keystone connects OpenID Connect to SAML federations.
- This page covers the tests your application needs to pass before publication in
  the OpenAthens Federation.
- The goal is not to tick boxes, but to make sure that our mutual customers get the
  best experience from us both.
- Ensure your EntityID contains a domain name that you own or have permission to use.
- The application must be able to accept multiple eduPersonScopedAffiliation attributes.
- The hosted Wayfinder is free for anyone to use whether or not you are a member of
  the OpenAthens federation
- It encourages the end users to use federated services more
- Wayfinder uses the SAML DS protocol and as long as your SP software does too it's
  just a case of configuring it to use Wayfinder as the discovery service and updating
  federation metadata.
- If you are not a member of our federations, you are still welcome to use Wayfinder
  at no cost.
- Geolocation can help users select the correct organisation when none are shown.
- It is recommended to allow the organisation selection a user made elsewhere using
  Wayfinder to be reflected in your instance.
- Wayfinder can be freely used by anyone whether or not they use OpenAthens.
- The OpenAthens federation will not be enabled until your application is published.
- Ensure that data from the button is only used when the button is clicked so that
  users following a wayfless links do not have that entityID overwritten.
- The button will never be aware of 1:1 connections you have set up via Keystone,
  only customers in federations.
- Users have the option to select a remembered IdP or search again.
- If the user's browser shares geo location data, Wayfinder will try to show the closest
  IdP to the user.
- The hosted version is provided as is and we cannot extend support to non-members.
- You are encouraged to opt in to the mailing lists available at https://www.openathens.net/communications/
  to keep up to date.
