auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.flip.id/docs/money-transfer/integration:
  - Flip API uses HTTP Basic Authentication combined with optional RSA signature verification
    for Disbursement APIs. For Basic Auth, encode your API key and secret as Base64
    in the format "api_key:api_secret" and send in the Authorization header. For Disbursement
    APIs, optionally generate an RSA-2048 signature using sha256WithRSAEncryption
    on the JSON payload, Base64-encode it, and include in requests; obtain your public/private
    key pair and register the public key with the Flip API Integration team before
    enabling signatures.
- information_source; https://docs.flip.id/docs/international-transfer/integration:
  - 'Disbursement API requests require two authentication headers: Authorization header
    with Basic authentication using Base64-encoded API Secret Key followed by a colon,
    and X-Signature header containing an HMAC SHA512 signature generated from the
    request payload using a private key.


    Authorization header format: Authorization: Basic <Base64(Your-API-SecretKey +
    :)>


    X-Signature header: X-Signature: Your-Generated-Signature, where the signature
    is generated by computing HMAC SHA512 of the JSON payload using a private key.


    Both headers must be included in every Disbursement API request.'
  - 'Signature-based request authentication is optional and disabled by default for
    Disbursement APIs. To use it: generate an RSA 2048-bit public/private key pair,
    send your public key to the Flip API Integration team, then sign requests by converting
    the POST/GET payload to a JSON string, creating a signature using sha256WithRSAEncryption
    with your private key, and encoding the result in Base64. Include the generated
    signature in your request (header or parameter location not specified in this
    excerpt).'
- information_source; https://docs.flip.id/docs/accept-payment/direct-api/va-integration:
  - Basic authentication is required using the Authorization header with the format
    "Basic Base64(<FLIP_API_SECRET_KEY + :>)", where FLIP_API_SECRET_KEY is your API
    secret key encoded in Base64 with a colon appended. Send this header with every
    request to authenticate.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The Authorization header must contain
    the value "Basic" followed by a Base64-encoded string of your FLIP_API_SECRET_KEY
    concatenated with a colon (FLIP_API_SECRET_KEY + :). Send this in the Authorization
    request header.
