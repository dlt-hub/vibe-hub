  - API key authentication is required. Include the x-api-key header with your API
    key value in each request to the MOT test history endpoint.
  - 'All requests to the HGV/PSV Operators Annual Test History API require an API
    Key for authentication. Include two mandatory headers in every request: Content-Type
    set to application/json and x-api-key set to your unique API key value. The API
    key identifies the request source and is used for throttling and quota management,
    so treat it as sensitive information. A 403 response indicates a missing or invalid
    x-api-key header.'

    HTTP headers: Content-Type set to application/json and x-api-key set to your unique

    information since throttling and quotas are managed per API key. Requests without
    a valid API key will receive a 403 unauthorized response.'
