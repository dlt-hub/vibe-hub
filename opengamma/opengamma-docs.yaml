pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.opengamma.com/:
  - The API uses polling-based pagination for asynchronous calculation results. Extract
    the calcId from the Location response header and poll the GET /calcs/v1/base/whatif/v1/calcs/{calcId}
    endpoint periodically until the status field changes from PENDING to COMPLETED.
    If the response exceeds 3MB, the server returns an HTTP 302 redirect to a temporary
    location containing the full results.
