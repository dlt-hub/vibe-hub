auth_info:
- information_source; https://plaid.com/docs/api/:
  - Almost all Plaid API endpoints require authentication using a client_id and secret
    obtained from the Plaid Dashboard. These credentials can be sent either in the
    request body or as HTTP headers named PLAID-CLIENT-ID and PLAID-SECRET. All requests
    must be POST requests over HTTPS with TLS v1.2, include a Content-Type header
    of application/json, and send valid JSON in the body.
- information_source; https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/auth/:
  - Plaid API uses client credentials authentication. The client_id and secret are
    required and may be provided either in request headers (PLAID-CLIENT-ID and PLAID-SECRET
    respectively) or in the request body as fields named client_id and secret.
- information_source; https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/:
  - The `/link/token/get` endpoint requires Plaid API authentication via client_id
    and client_secret. The client_id can be provided either in the PLAID-CLIENT-ID
    header or in the request body, and client_secret is required in the request body.
    These credentials are used to authenticate requests to retrieve Link session information
    and event data.
