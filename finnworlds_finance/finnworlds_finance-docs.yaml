Here's the YAML configuration for the `finnworlds_finance` REST API source based on the provided documentation:

client:
  base_url: "https://finnworlds.com/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"  # Authentication method is via API key

resources:
  - name: "bonds"
    endpoint: "/api/bonds"  # Example endpoint, adjust if needed
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned in the documentation
    data_selector: "$"  # Assuming the data is directly under the root of the JSON response

  - name: "dividends"
    endpoint: "/api/dividends"  # Example endpoint, adjust if needed
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned in the documentation
    data_selector: "$"

  - name: "stock_splits"
    endpoint: "/api/stock_splits"  # Example endpoint, adjust if needed
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned in the documentation
    data_selector: "$"

  - name: "historical_candlestick"
    endpoint: "/api/historical_candlestick"  # Example endpoint, adjust if needed

    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned in the documentation
    data_selector: "$"

notes:
  - "The API does not support pagination for most streams."
  - "Incremental loading is not supported; entire datasets must be fetched each time."
  - "Authentication is done via an API key, which must be included in the header under 'x-api-key'."

errors:
  - 401  # Unauthorized, likely due to missing or invalid API key
  - 403  # Forbidden, possibly due to insufficient permissions
  - 429  # Too Many Requests, indicating rate limiting

auth_info:
  mentioned_objects:
    - "API key is required and should be included in the request headers."
    - "Refer to the Finnworlds website for obtaining an API key."

source_metadata:
  description: "Finnworlds Finance API provides access to various financial data including bonds, dividends, stock splits, and macroeconomic indicators."
### Notes:
1. The example endpoints (e.g., `/api/bonds`) are placeholders and should be adjusted based on the actual API documentation once available.
2. The exact query parameters for each endpoint were not specified in the provided documentation, hence they are left blank. If any parameters are needed, they should be added accordingly.
3. The `data_selector` is set to `"$"` which assumes that the JSON data returned from the API is structured such that the relevant data is directly available at the root level. This may need to be adapted based on the actual response structure.
