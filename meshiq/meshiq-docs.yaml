  : - Basic authentication is required. Use the credentials from your Navigator login
      (demo / demo for the demo system) with the standard HTTP Basic Auth scheme,
      sending base64-encoded username:password in the Authorization header.

  : - 'Authorization header using Basic authentication scheme. The header format is
      "Authorization: Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of credentials in
      the format "username:password". In the example provided, the base64 string decodes
      to "Admin:admin".'
    - Basic authentication is required for Navigator REST API operations. Credentials
      are passed using the `-u` flag in curl or the `Authorization` header with base64-encoded
      username:password in the format `username:password`. The example shows `-u Admin:admin`
      for authentication.
    - The API supports two authentication methods. Option 1 uses a POST request to
      http://localhost:8019/auth/token with a JSON body containing username, password,
      client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "password", and scope set to "*"
      to obtain an authorization token. Option 2 uses HTTP Basic Authentication (basicAuth)
      with username and password credentials via the Swagger UI Authorize button.
    - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed via the `-u`
      flag in curl as `username:password` (e.g., `-u Admin:admin`), which translates
      to the `Authorization` header with base64-encoded credentials in the format
      `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`.'
