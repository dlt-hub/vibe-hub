auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.kaleyra.io/reference/video-authentication:
  - API requests require an API key passed in the `apikey` header. All requests must
    use HTTPS. For SDK services, a back-end service must call the Generate SDK Credentials
    API endpoint with a user_id and expires_in payload, using the REST API key in
    the header, which returns an access_token for client use.
  - Authenticate requests by including your secret API key in the `apikey` header
    of every request. The API key must be present in the header or the request will
    fail.

  - The Bandyer Chat Widget requires token-based authentication. Set userId, appId,
    region, and environment variables, then obtain an accessToken from a server-side
    POST /sdk/credentials endpoint. Pass the accessToken to the Client.connect(userId,
    accessToken) method along with the userId to authenticate the widget connection.
  - 'The widget client requires two credentials to connect: a userId and an accessToken.
    The accessToken should be retrieved server-side via a POST request to /sdk/credentials
    endpoint and passed to the Client.connect(userId, accessToken) method. The region
    (eu or in) and environment (sandbox or production) must also be configured.'
