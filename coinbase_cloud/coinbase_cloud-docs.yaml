auth_info:
- information_source; https://coinbase-cloud.mintlify.app/api-reference/v2/authentication:
  - 'Bearer Token (JWT) authentication is required. Generate a JWT token and include
    it in the Authorization header as "Bearer $JWT". The token expires after 2 minutes
    and must be refreshed. For sensitive wallet write operations, an additional Wallet
    Secret is used to generate a Wallet Token (JWT) sent via the X-Wallet-Auth header.
    Required headers: Authorization (Bearer token), Content-Type (application/json),
    Accept (application/json).'
  - Bearer Tokens (JWTs) are required for server-to-server communication and must
    be included in the Authorization header. They are generated using your Secret
    API Key. Store your KEY_NAME and KEY_SECRET as environment variables for secure
    access, never hardcode them in your code.
  - Client API Key is included in the URL path at https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/${CLIENT_API_KEY}
    for JSON-RPC requests. Secret API Key is required for server-to-server communication
    and is used to generate a Bearer Token JWT that goes in the Authorization header.
    The Secret API Key must be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code,
    and can be configured with IP allowlists.
  - 'The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication signed with ECDSA. Credentials
    are provided via environment variables: WALLET_SECRET contains a base64-encoded
    PKCS8 private key used to sign JWTs. The JWT payload includes iat (issued at),
    nbf (not before), jti (unique ID), and uris (array containing the request method,
    host, and path). If a request body is present, a reqHash field containing the
    SHA256 hash of the sorted request body JSON is added to the payload. The signed
    JWT is then used to authenticate API requests.'
  - The API uses two JWT bearer tokens for authentication. Send the primary JWT in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer ${JWT}" and a wallet-specific JWT in the "X-Wallet-Auth"
    header. Both tokens are passed as environment variables and required for authenticated
    requests.
