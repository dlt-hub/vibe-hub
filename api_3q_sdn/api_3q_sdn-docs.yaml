auth_info:
- information_source; https://sdn.3qsdn.com/api/doc:
  - The API uses an API Key-based authentication scheme. Each request must include
    the X-AUTH-APIKEY header with the user's API Key, which is obtained from the 3Q
    SDN Account settings under Account -> My Account -> API Access Key. The API Key
    inherits the user's rights and permissions. All requests must be made over HTTPS
    to ensure the header is encrypted.
