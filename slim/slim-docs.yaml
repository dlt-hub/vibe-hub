auth_info:
- information_source; https://learn.getcapi.org/basics/rest-api:
  - 'The REST API supports two authentication methods: basic user/password authentication
    or API tokens. Tokens can be managed remotely via dedicated Token Management API
    endpoints (GET /token/{token} for authentication, POST /token/manage/ to create
    tokens, DELETE /token/manage/tokenid/{tokenid} to delete tokens). Responses are
    returned in JSON format. Specific header names, parameter names, and token transmission
    details are not provided in this documentation excerpt.'
  - cAPI supports token authentication created per-user via the Services Control Panel,
    or standard Joomla user authentication. Token authentication is required for some
    routes and enables granular access control. Tokens are managed individually and
    multiple tokens can be created per Joomla user. Consult the Swagger UI documentation
    at the provided URL for specific token endpoint details including header names
    and parameter formats.
- information_source; https://learn.getcapi.org/intermediate/basic-authentication:
  - Build a string of the form username:password, Base64 encode it, and supply an
    "Authorization" header with content "Basic " followed by the encoded string. Optionally
    append the URL parameter basic_auth=true to trigger a browser authentication prompt.
    Always use HTTPS for API connections.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication passed via the HTTP Authorization header.
    The token is sent as "Bearer {token}" in the Authorization header (e.g., "Bearer
    wolf"). When using FastCGI with Apache, the header may be available as either
    HTTP_AUTHORIZATION or REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, and your code must check both
    variants.
  - cAPI REST API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Construct a string of username:password,
    Base64 encode it, and send it in the Authorization header as "Basic " followed
    by the encoded string. Alternatively, use the -u argument in curl or equivalent
    client mechanisms that automatically build the required headers.
