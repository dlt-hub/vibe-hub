auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2:

  - 'API Key or OAuth authentication is required. Send the API key as the `api_key`

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2:
  - Pagination uses a `before` query parameter (optional, unix timestamp) to request
    earlier invitations. Responses include an `invitations` array (max 20 per page)
    and a `_links` object with next page info when more than 20 invitations exist.
  - Pagination uses limit (number of results, default 20) and offset (starting position,
    default 0) as query parameters. Both are optional. Stop paginating when the response
    contains fewer results than the limit value.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. limit (default 20, optional) specifies
    number of results per request, and offset (default 0, optional) specifies the
    starting post number. Use the offset value to construct subsequent requests for
    additional pages.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with limit and offset query parameters.
    limit defaults to 20 with no stated maximum, offset defaults to 0. Alternatively,
    use before or after integer parameters for cursor-based pagination, but only one
    of offset, before, or after can be provided per request. Maximum offset is 1000;
    use before or after for larger result sets. Response includes liked_posts array
    and liked_count total.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation. The response includes a _links.next object
    containing an href with the next page URL and a query_params.offset field set
    to 20, indicating the offset value for the next request. Continue paginating by
    following the href or using the offset value until no next link is returned.
