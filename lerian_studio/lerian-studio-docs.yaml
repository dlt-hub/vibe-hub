notes:
- The sandbox is designed for learning and exploration.
- Data is mocked or non-persistent.
- Midaz uses idempotency keys to make sure operations are safe to retry, and never
  processed more than once.
- If the request doesn’t include an existing idempotency key, Midaz creates a new
  one.
- Metadata does not support nested values.
- By default, API endpoints that support pagination accept a maximum of 100 items
  per page (limit=100).
- Midaz is dedicated to maintaining high standards of software quality.
- New features must include corresponding unit tests.
- We aim for comprehensive test coverage as a benchmark for software quality.
