auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.fareharbor.com/api/external/v1/home:
  - 'API authentication requires two header parameters: X-FareHarbor-API-App containing
    your APP-KEY and X-FareHarbor-API-User containing your USER-KEY. Both headers
    are required for all requests. You can retrieve your keys by logging into your
    FareHarbor account.'
  - API authentication uses two custom headers that must be set from environment variables.
    The X-FareHarbor-API-App header requires the FH_API_APP environment variable value,
    and the X-FareHarbor-API-User header requires the FH_API_USER environment variable
    value. Both headers must be included in all requests to the API.
  - 'Authentication for this API requires two required headers: X-FareHarbor-API-App
    (your APP-KEY obtained by logging in) and X-FareHarbor-API-User (your USER-KEY
    obtained by logging in). Both headers must be included in every request to access
    company user data.'
  - Authentication requires a USER-KEY credential. The USER-KEY must be provided to
    access the API (note indicates "Please log in to see your key"). While the exact
    transmission method is not explicitly stated in this excerpt, USER-KEY is the
    required authentication credential for this endpoint.
  - 'Authentication requires two UUID-format keys: an app key identifying your application
    and a user key identifying a specific user on a specific affiliate. Both keys
    must be sent as custom HTTP headers named X-FareHarbor-API-App and X-FareHarbor-API-User
    respectively. Keys must be kept private and rotated if disclosed.'
