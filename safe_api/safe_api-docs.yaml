auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.safe.security/docs/accessing-safe-apis:
  - Basic authentication with username and password is required to access the SAFE
    API portal and generate an access token via POST /api/v3/auth. After obtaining
    the accessToken from the auth endpoint, include it in subsequent API requests
    using the bearer token scheme in the Authorization header. The access token is
    valid for one hour.
  - Bearer token authentication is required to access SAFE APIs. Obtain an accessToken
    from the authorization process, paste it into the bearer token field in Swagger,
    and use it in the Authorization header. Access tokens expire after one hour and
    must be refreshed by repeating the authorization process.
