auth_info:
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/import-google-my-business-data-to-google-sheets/:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required using Google My Business credentials. The
    API uses OAuth for authorization, and you must authenticate through Google My
    Business to obtain the necessary access tokens for making requests to the Google
    Business Profile Performance API endpoints.
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/create-custom-request/:
  - API key authentication is used, passed as a query parameter named api_key. Include
    the api_key query parameter in the request URL (e.g., com/api/v1/link?api_key=12345).
    Additionally, a workspace_id field must be provided in the JSON request body to
    specify which workspace the request applies to.
  - Linkly API requires an API key passed as a query parameter and a workspace ID
    included in the request body. Send POST requests to https://app.linklyhq.com/api/v1/link
    with api_key=YOUR_API_KEY as a query parameter and workspace_id in the JSON body.
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/import-coingecko-data-to-google-sheets/:
  - CoinGecko API uses an optional API key passed as a custom header for authentication.
    For the free API, use the header `x-cg-demo-api-key` with your key value. For
    the paid API, change the base URL to `https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/` and
    use the header `x-cg-pro-api-key` instead.
  - CoinGecko supports optional API key authentication as of October 2023. Requests
    can be made without a key, but authenticated requests using an API key avoid shared
    rate limits. The documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter
    name, or format for submitting the API key in requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/import-google-my-business-data-to-google-sheets/:
  - The Google Business API uses cursor-based pagination with pageSize parameter to
    control records returned per request. Set pageSize to 50 or 100 depending on endpoint
    limits. Use the pageToken parameter in subsequent requests, retrieving its value
    from the next_page_token field in the response to fetch additional records.
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/import-coinmarketcap-data-to-google-sheets/:
  - The CoinMarketCap API uses offset-limit pagination with a limit parameter capped
    at 1000. The limit parameter controls the maximum number of results returned per
    request, and you continue making requests with incremented offsets until you reach
    your desired stopping point.
  - The CoinMarketCap listings endpoint uses query parameters start and limit for
    pagination. Set start to the beginning position (e.g., 1001) and limit to the
    number of results per request (e.g., 1000) to retrieve specific ranges of coins
    sorted by market capitalization.
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/import-facebook-ad-data-to-google-sheets/:
  - By default Facebook limits results to 25 records per response. Use the limit query
    parameter set to 5000 to increase results per request. Pagination is handled using
    a cursor-based system where you loop through results using pagination tokens returned
    in the response to fetch additional records.
- information_source; https://mixedanalytics.com/knowledge-base/filter-specific-fields-values/:
  - Use limit query parameter (default 100) to control page size. Navigate using next_uri
    field in response; stop when next_uri is null or absent.
