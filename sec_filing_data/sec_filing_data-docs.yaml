pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.secfilingdata.com/docs/mapping/:
  - 'Pagination uses from and size parameters in the request body: from specifies
    the starting position (default 0) and size specifies the number of results per
    page (default 20). Continue paginating by incrementing from by the size value
    until fewer results than size are returned.'
- information_source; https://api.secfilingdata.com/request-parameters:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with "from" parameter (starting position,
    default 0) and "size" parameter (number of results per page, default 20). Increment
    "from" by the "size" value to request subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://api.secfilingdata.com/docs/query-api/:
  - Use the `from` parameter (query body, optional) to set the starting position for
    pagination, and the `size` parameter (query body, optional) to specify the number
    of filings returned per request. Increment `from` by the `size` value to retrieve
    subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://api.secfilingdata.com/docs/insider-trades/:
  - Pagination uses a 'from' parameter that should be incremented by 50 for each subsequent
    request to retrieve additional batches of insider transactions, with a maximum
    of 50 transactions returned per query.
  - The Insider Trading Data API uses offset-based pagination with `from` and `size`
    parameters in the request body. The `from` parameter (string) sets the starting
    position and defaults to 0, while `size` (string) specifies results per request
    with a maximum of 50 and default of 50. The response contains a `transactions`
    array with matching results; continue paginating by incrementing `from` by the
    `size` value until fewer results than `size` are returned.
