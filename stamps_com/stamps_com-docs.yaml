auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.stamps.com/rest-api/reference/:
  - 'API users must be authorized through SERA (Production or Staging) to access this
    endpoint. Users can only reprint labels originally printed from their own user
    account. The documentation references "Authorizations: SERA (Production) SERA
    (Staging)" but does not specify the exact authentication mechanism, headers, or
    parameters required to authenticate requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses a sign-in flow with separate staging and production endpoints.
    Credentials are obtained by signing in at the authentication endpoint (staging:
    https://signin.testing.stampsendicia.com or production: https://signin.stampsendicia.com),
    then used to access the SERA API at the respective environment base URL (staging:
    https://api.testing.stampsendicia.com/sera or production: https://api.stampsendicia.com/sera).
    The documentation does not specify the exact header names, parameter names, or
    token format for subsequent API requests.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Applications must register a redirect_uri
    in advance to obtain a Client ID. After receiving an authorization code, call
    the /oauth/token endpoint to get an access_token and refresh_token. Include the
    access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for all SERA
    API calls. When the access_token expires, use the refresh_token to call /oauth/token
    again for a new access_token.
  - SERA authentication is required. The API uses SERA (Production at api.stampsendicia.com/sera
    and Staging at api.testing.stampsendicia.com/sera) as the authorization scheme.
    Specific header names, token formats, or credential passing methods are not detailed
    in this documentation excerpt.
  - SERA uses OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. All requests must be made over
    HTTPS with TLS v1.2 or higher. POST requests require an Idempotency-key header
    containing a randomly-generated version-4 UUID to prevent duplicate processing
    within a 24-hour window.
