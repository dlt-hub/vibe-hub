    query parameters to control page size and starting position respectively.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters. limit is optional with default 100
    and maximum 1000, offset is optional with default 0 and maximum 100000. When client_order_id
    is set, limit and offset are ignored.

    max 1000) specifies the number of results per request, and the offset parameter

    limit value to retrieve subsequent pages until fewer results than the limit are
    returned.
