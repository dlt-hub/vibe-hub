notes:
- To finalize the configuration, select a name, slug, and subscription.
- The maximum allowed size of a template is 10 MB.
- Malicious and dangerous code is not allowed, and we reserve the right to remove
  such applications.
- Older versions of Mac OS X and Windows do not support the native Docker application,
  but require Docker to be run using VirtualBox.
- Access logs to debug and troubleshoot your app.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The free trial does not allow you to modify resources.
- Paid subscriptions allow you to modify memory, instances, storage, backups, the
  number of domains, and more.
- Not all features are available to all plans.
- Divio Cloud offers robust support for PHP through containerization, streamlining
  development and deployment processes.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Divio
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Deployment may take a few minutes depending on application complexity.
- Ensure to verify payment information for account verification.
- Requires setup of connected app in Divio
- Some API calls may return rate limits
- The free trial does not allow you to modify resources
- Ensure proper authentication setup is completed before accessing the API.
- Some features may not be available on free trial accounts
- Some features may not be available on the free trial
- The default branch that we and most Git providers use is main.
- Admin user is not created automatically after deployment.
- Please note that the admin user is not created automatically.
- The docker-compose.yml file should be in the root of your application and contain
  the necessary instructions to build and run your application.
- Ensure to set up the connected app in the Divio Cloud Platform for OAuth2.
- Consider Docker compatibility for deployment on the platform.
- The quickstart guide focuses on getting your Flask app up and running on the Divio
  Cloud Platform.
- The admin user is not created automatically.
- Migrations are also not run automatically.
- Requires Docker to run applications.
- Admin user is not created automatically.
- Requires setup of connected app in Divio.
- Ensure your application meets all requirements before deploying.
- Requires setup of a connected app in Divio.
- Deployment failures do not cause downtime.
- Aldryn continues to be supported by Divio, but we do not recommend using Aldryn
  Django for new applications.
- Security is a top priority at Divio.
- The platform offers robust security measures, including SSL encryption.
- Docker builds the application image from the Dockerfile.
- If environment variables are required as part of the build process, use the ENV
  command to supply them via the Dockerfile.
- 'Some of the media storage domains we use are not cached, including: sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io,
  aldryn-media.io, s3.amazonaws.com.'
- There are several potential issues you can encounter while containerising your web
  application.
- If there is no apparent error in the logs, you can try to deploy the application
  again. Sometimes, the error is transient and a re-deployment will fix it.
- The most common issue between those environments is that a different command is
  run locally through the docker-compose.yml file than in the Dockerfile.
- Check the environment variables set in the cloud environment and compare them with
  the local environment.
- This error indicates that the container is not running. This issue can happen to
  test environments that have not been used for a long time.
- Proper management of dependencies ensures your project runs consistently across
  different environments.
- We recommend to pin your dependencies to avoid unexpected issues when newer versions
  introduce breaking changes.
- To avoid issues between your local environment and Divio Cloud, use docker compose
  to manage/install your dependencies and not your local setup.
- Docker requires a Linux host for its containers.
- On newer systems, the Alpine Linux host is provided through native operating system
  virtualisation.
- The secret key may contain encoded characters that need to be decoded.
- The connection URL grants access only to a specific index, and not to other indexes.
- IP addresses are not to be relied upon as a means of reaching or identifying Divio
  applications or servers.
- Even if a server's IP remains the same, an application might be moved to a different
  server at any time.
- Load-balancer IP addresses can be regarded as semi-static.
- Divio supports private registry integration, enabling applications to pull container
  images from private registries during the build process.
- Divio supports credentials for most container registry providers, including Docker
  Hub, GitLab Container Registry, and GitHub Container Registry.
- All Divio sites can be accessed using the HTTPS protocol instead of plain HTTP.
- Certificates have a 90-day lifetime, and are renewed automatically 40 days before
  expiry.
- By default, applications use our own Git server.
- We also offer the option to manage your application's codebase on remote Git providers.
- The wheels proxy continues to be supported by Divio, but we do not recommend using
  it for new applications.
- Using our wheels proxy is optional, but allows packages to be installed - and Docker
  images to be built - much faster.
- Applications can be moved to different organisations you belong to.
- An application cannot be transferred while it has a subscription applied.
- Each application includes a Test and Live environment by default.
- All environments share the same Git repository but can use different branches.
- Backups are essential for managing an application.
- 'Backups on Divio are in accordance with two key principles: Data integrity and
  Portability.'
- Cron jobs are not available on all Divio subscriptions and we allow further customisation
  on Business and Enterprise plans.
- Default timeout is 10 minutes.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Environment variables should only apply to environments, not states or processes
  independent of a particular environment.
- Changes to environment variables will not apply until the environment is relaunched.
- 'Logs are separated into categories: web, cronjob, shell, worker, deployment, and
  all.'
- The logs are displayed in real-time and are retained for a certain period, depending
  on your subscription plan.
- Maintenance operations may require brief downtime.
- Maintenance windows are set to hours UTC 01:00-05:00 each Monday by default.
- Services are currently in beta and may be subject to change.

- Changes to a cloudspace require a migration through maintenance. During the migration,
  your application will be unavailable.
- We support ED25519, RSA and ECDSA keys, but not DSA.
- Use the cloud media storage rather than local file storage
- Using the cloud database rather than a local instance
