notes:
- Version pinning is recommended for production deployments to prevent potential compatibility
  issues with the latest version.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- No server required. Use npm, yarn, npx or Docker.
- Pricing is usage-based, with an optional minimum commit to lower your per-request
  cost. You can set a maximum budget to prevent over-spending.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- TLS (1.2+) for data encryption in transit
- AES-256 for data encryption at rest
- Customer must ensure that the Input, Output and Customer’s use of GenAI Tools do
  not violate any applicable law or infringe, violate, or misappropriate any proprietary
  rights.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Redocly
- Redocly will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Products available
  with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9% and maintain a Response Time
  of 24 hours or less.
- Customer must comply with its obligations as a Controller under Data Protection
  Laws.
- Default "https://cors.redoc.ly"
- Default true
- Default false
- Default 3
- Default 0
- Default 5
- Generate documentation previews for API descriptions on your local machine.
- An API key from Redocly is required to use the live documentation preview feature
  in the extension.
- Functionality of the extension may be affected by some limitations of the VS Code
  editor.
- Uses a lightweight flow for quick documentation updates
- On-premise functionality is supported only in our Enterprise plans.
- Static API documentation produces static HTML and CSS files based on your API definition.
- This feature is only available in our Enterprise plans.
- You must provide your Enterprise license key to the CLI tool.
- To log in, a personal API key is required.
- Running `redocly --version` confirms that the installation was successful, and the
  currently-installed version of the tool.
- The bundle command pulls the relevant parts of an API description into a single
  file output in JSON or YAML format.
- Use eject when your customization needs outgrow styling or configuration capabilities.
- The `join` command is considered an experimental feature.
- The `join` command supports OpenAPI 3.x descriptions only.
- Default value is 100.
- 'When you run the `lint` command without a configuration file, it uses the `extends:
  [recommended]` by default.'
- If you try to execute the `lint` command without apis when your project doesn't
  have any configuration files, the `lint` command displays an error.
- By default, previews are run in enterprise plan mode.
- The default value for port is 4000.
- To preview docs using the premium Redocly API reference docs, you must first authenticate
  to the API registry with the login command.
- The content is overwritten every time changes are detected in comparison to the
  current content.
- This command is used with Reunite products only.
- Requires setup of user account in a Reunite project and an active organization API
  key.
- The default output format for stats is called 'stylish'.
- Use --format=json to get a machine-readable output format.
- Use --config to provide an alternative path to a configuration file.
- The command is additive; it doesn't overwrite existing translation keys.
- Custom translation keys used in React components must be manually added to the translation.yaml
  file.
- OpenAPI is designed with support for $ref syntax, allowing parts of an API description
  to be described elsewhere, and reused between multiple descriptions.
- Some tools require one file, so it's likely that you may need this step at some
  point in your workflow.
- The Redocly CLI configuration file can be used locally, in CI, or on hosted platforms.
- Configuration options can be nested within a specific API entry.
- Custom plugins are a powerful way to extend Redocly.
- Use of custom plugins requires in-depth knowledge of the document type and JavaScript
  coding skills.
- A personal API key is required.
- Redocly CLI searches for the file in the local directory
- You can specify a configuration file with your command
- Run CLI behind a proxy using HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.
- Added x-security extension for Respect that enables secure handling of authentication
  in Arazzo workflows. Use this extension to define security schemes at the step level
  using either predefined schemes or inline definitions.
- Pass values of secrets (passwords, tokens, API keys).
- Support multiple authentication types including API Key (query, header, or cookie),
  Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, Digest Authentication, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect.
- Automatically transform security parameters into appropriate HTTP headers or query
  parameters.
- Added environment variable support for CLI arguments using Yargs .env() method to
  parse environment variables with matching prefixes.
- Added new CLI options for the respect command to improve test execution control.
- Added `x-security` extension for Respect that enables secure handling of authentication
  in Arazzo workflows.
- Added x-security extension for Respect that enables secure handling of authentication
  in Arazzo workflows.
- Improved Respect's error handling when server URLs are missing from both OpenAPI
  descriptions and CLI options.
- Removed backward compatibility for the `spec` rule. Use `struct` instead.
- Removed support for the deprecated `apiDefinitions` option in the Redocly config.
  Use `apis` instead. Removed the `labels` field within the `apis` section, which
  was associated with the legacy Redocly API Registry product.
- Removed support for the deprecated `features.openapi` and `features.mockServer`
  configuration options. Use `openapi` and `mockServer` directly instead.
- Removed backward compatibility for the deprecated `lint` and `styleguide` options
  in the Redocly config. Use `rules`, `decorators` and other related options on the
  root level instead.
- Removed the deprecated `disallowAdditionalProperties` option support in rules. Use
  `allowAdditionalProperties` instead.
- Removed the deprecated `undefined` assertion. Use `defined` instead.
- Removed support for the legacy Redocly API Registry in favor of the new Reunite
  platform. Reunite provides improved API management capabilities and better integration
  with Redocly's tooling ecosystem. Migrated the `login` and `push` commands to work
  exclusively with Reunite. Removed the `preview-docs` command as part of platform
  modernization. Use the `preview` command instead.
- Removed support for the deprecated `referenceDocs` option, which was related to
  the legacy Reference docs product.
- Removed support for the deprecated `assert/` prefix in configurable rules. Use `rule/`
  prefix instead.
- Migrated the codebase to ES Modules from CommonJS, bringing improved code organization
  and better support for modern JavaScript features. Update to Node.js version 20.19.0+,
  22.12.0+, or 23+.
- Removed support for the deprecated `apiDefinitions` option in the Redocly config.
  Use `apis` instead.
- Redocly CLI comes with one primary configuration file (`redocly.yaml`), also known
  as the Redocly configuration file.
- The Redocly configuration file must sit in your root directory.
- OpenAPI is designed with support for $ref syntax, allowing parts of an API description
  to be described elsewhere.
- This feature is experimental, and supports OpenAPI 3.x only.
- Uses individual rules to make the API linting fit your API needs.
- Start with the recommended or minimal ruleset, then adjust as needed.
- The `lint` command reports on problems and executes preprocessors and rules.
- The default value for `--max-problems` is 100.
- The mock server feature is only available to Pro and Enterprise customers.
- The mock server feature is disabled by default.
- Default 2
