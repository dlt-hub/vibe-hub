  - Basic authentication requires a username and password. NTLM authentication also
    requires a username and password. Both schemes send credentials with each request
    to authenticate access to the third-party system API.
- information_source; https://docs.truecontext.com/1374411/Content/Published/217500628_HTTPConnection.html:
  - 'TrueContext supports multiple authentication schemes for HTTP connections: Basic
    auth, NTLM, Form-Based, Bearer Token, OAuth 2.0, and API Key. Authentication tokens
    can be included in the Base URL, headers, or configured when setting up a Data
    Source or Data Destination. Anonymous Access is also available for systems that
    do not require authentication.'
