auth_info:

  - Access tokens must be provided in the Authenticate HTTP header in the form "Token
    mytoken". Tokens are created from the token management page and assigned explicit
    permissions that determine which endpoints each token can access. Anonymous users
    can perform read-only operations on publicly published content without authentication.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.aristotlemetadata.com/api/rest:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with query parameter page. Responses include
    count (total items), next (URL for next page), previous (URL for previous page),
    and results (array of items). Stop paginating when next is null.
- information_source; https://docs.aristotlemetadata.com/_sources/api/rest.rst.txt:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with query parameter page (e.g., page=2).
    Response includes count (total items), next (URL for next page or null), previous
    (URL for previous page or null), and results (array of items). Construct subsequent
    requests by following the next or previous URL values until next becomes null.
  - The Aristotle Metadata REST API uses pagination with a JSON object wrapper containing
    a count field and information for accessing next and previous pages, though the
    documentation excerpt does not provide complete details on request parameters
    (such as page, limit, or offset) or response fields (such as next, previous, or
    has_more) needed to construct paginated requests.
