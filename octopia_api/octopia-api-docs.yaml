notes:
- This data contract is not the final version and may change
- Performance of GET /offers routes has been improved. You can now request a maximum
  of 1000 offers per call (previously 60). The default limit is 100.
- The old endpoint POST /offers/search will soon be deprecated. Remember to migrate
  to the new GET /offers endpoint.
- You will need a valid sellerId to make test calls, seller 700982 though heavily
  restricted quota wise, does not need specific access grants.
- These product features work for English, French and Spanish languages.
- You will need a valid sellerId to make test calls.
- 'Pre-requisites: In order to retrieve and update orders, you need a valid access
  token.'
- Not all sales channels allow manual acceptance, therefore the states 'WaitingAcceptance'
  and 'Refused' won’t be available on all orders.
- Sellers can retrieve all the financial information of an order (or refund) at Day
  +1.
- Commission statements are issued every 10 days on 9/19/29 of the month.
- 'Pre-requisites: In order to retrieve and update orders, you need a valid access
  token'
- This feature is enabled on a per SalesChannel basis, depending on expected billing
  requirements from sellers.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
