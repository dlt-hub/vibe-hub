notes:
- The middleware will perform a call `fn(...arg, cb)`. The `cb` is a callback passed
  by the middleware to `fn`. If `fn` terminates normally, it must call `cb(null, result)`
  to notify the middleware of a successful result. If `fn` encounters some error,
  then it must call `cb(error)` in order to notify the middleware that an error has
  occurred.
- fork, alongside race, is a central Effect for managing concurrency between Sagas.
- When resolving a `race`, the middleware automatically cancels all the losing Effects.
- 'When running Effects in parallel, the middleware suspends the Generator until one
  of the following occurs: All the Effects completed with success or One of the Effects
  was rejected before all the effects complete.'
- This is IE8-compatible port of redux-saga with API-incompatible changes.
- This is IE8-compatible port of redux-saga, with API-incompatible changes. Notice
  that this is NOT a drop-in replacement for redux-saga!
- 'Important: your browser must support Generators. Latest versions of Chrome/Firefox/Edge
  are suitable.'
- This is IE8-compatible port of redux-saga, with API-incompatible changes.
- Uses Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous actions.
- In order to test the failure case, we'll use the `throw` method of the Generator
- The yield statement is great for representing asynchronous control flow in a simple
  and linear style.
- Effects will get executed in parallel when yielded as an array.
- While using `yield*` provides an idiomatic way of composing Sagas, this approach
  has some limitations.
- Yielding to an array of nested generators will start all the sub-generators in parallel.
- Cancelling a running task will also cancel the current Effect where the task is
  blocked at the moment of cancellation.
- It's important to remember that `yield cancel(task)` doesn't wait for the cancelled
  task to finish (i.e. to perform its finally block). The cancel effect behaves like
  fork.
- You need to sanitize your event sources as to not pass null or undefined through
  the event channel.
- Make sure that you yield the effects from the generator function.
- When a Saga is blocked on a blocking call then it will miss all the actions dispatched
  in-between.
- Important! If the browser you are targeting doesn't support ES2015 generators, you
  must provide a valid polyfill.
- Uses Generators for asynchronous operations
- Sagas are fired only once at the start of the application
- In order to test the failure case, we'll use the throw method of the Generator
- You can also make your API service return a normal value with some error flag on
  it.
- Non-blocking calls are handled using fork to allow concurrent actions.
- Cancellation of tasks is managed using the cancel effect to maintain state consistency.
- It's important to remember that yield cancel(task) doesn't wait for the cancelled
  task to finish (i.e. to perform its finally block). The cancel effect behaves like
  fork. It returns as soon as the cancel was initiated.
- takeEvery allows multiple saga tasks to be forked concurrently.
- takeLatest doesn't allow multiple Saga tasks to be fired concurrently.
- By default, actionChannel buffers all incoming messages without limit.
- Messages on an eventChannel are not buffered by default.
- Make sure that you `yield` the effects from the generator function.
- The Saga will block here
- To avoid blocking the Saga, you can use a non-blocking call using `fork` instead
  of `call`.
- To cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke return on the underlying Generator
  object.
- Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas.
