notes:
- The frontend is designed as a mobile-first experience.
- It is a progressive web application and offers an app-like experience.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Integrations can provide translations for names of its entities.
- Localization of entity names is only supported for entities which set the has_entity_name
  property to True.
- Client connects and goes through an authentication phase.
- The command phase allows clients to send commands and receive results.
- The integration quality scale is a framework for Home Assistant to grade integrations
  based on user experience, features, code quality and developer experience.
- Data Entry Flow is a data entry framework that is part of Home Assistant.
- The config flow ID must be included in the external step URL.
- Use async_mark_external_step_done for user experience.
- Data Entry Flow is a framework for handling user input in Home Assistant.
- Flows can represent login forms or multi-step setup wizards.
- Data Entry Flow is used in Home Assistant to login, create config entries, handle
  options flow, repair issues.
- Data entry is done via data entry flows.
- The config flow informs the user that a task is in progress.
- The frontend will update each time progress is shown.
- The features in this page are still in very active development and should not be
  used yet by integrations. The API may change without a deprecation notice.
- No administrative tasks can be performed.
- The Assist API allows LLMs to interact with Home Assistant via intents.
- Local OAuth with Application Credentials Component is required by all integrations
  that support OAuth2.
- Cloud Account Linking with Cloud Component is recommended.
- Navigate to the [developer console](https://example.com/developer/console) to create
  credentials then enter them below.
- Backup agents should raise a BackupAgentError (or a subclass of BackupAgentError)
  exception on error.
- Integrations should raise ServiceValidationError (instead of ValueError) in case
  when the user did something wrong.
- For other failures such as a problem communicating with a device, HomeAssistantError
  should be raised.
- Integrations should raise ServiceValidationError instead of ValueError in case when
  the user did something wrong.
- An issue will be kept in the issue registry until it's removed by the integration
  that created it or by the user fixing it.
- Home Assistant doesn't only collect data, it also exports data to various services.
- Use the constants defined in const.py
- Import PLATFORM_SCHEMA from the integration you are integrating with and extend
  it.
- Type hints are not required for all modules at the moment in Home Assistant, but
  we aim to have a complete as possible coverage.
- Applying a monkeytyped stub to a module that has existing typing annotations might
  error and not work.
- Getting an instance URL can be rather complex, considering a user can have a bunch
  of different URLs available.

- '400: Bad Request'
- '401: Unauthorized'
