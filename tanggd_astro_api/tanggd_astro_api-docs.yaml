auth_info:

  - Google reCAPTCHA v3 requires server-side verification using a site secret key.
    Send a POST request to Google's verification endpoint with a JSON body containing
    the secret key (YOUR_SITE_SECRET_KEY, typically stored as an environment variable)
    and the response token received from the client. The secret key must be kept server-side
    only and never exposed to the client; the client receives only a PUBLIC_SITE_KEY
    for generating tokens.
