- ISO 27001 Certified
- GDPR Compliant
- HIPAA Compliant
- SOC 2 Compliant
- AI-powered observability requires comprehensive telemetry data collection.
- Real-time anomaly detection is integrated with historical trend analysis.
- Predictive monitoring models can forecast future resource requirements.
- Logit.io provides numerous open-source tools as hosted solutions.
- SIEM solutions must ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
- Integration of SIEM with other security tools involves API integration.
- Grafana dashboards can connect to various data sources such as traditional databases
  like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Grafana's REST APIs integration allows working with custom source types to achieve
  holistic system visibility across multiple environments.
- Grafana dashboards can be created rapidly with Logit.io’s managed Grafana platform.
- Requires setup of connected app in Logit.io
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Each request to a REST API Endpoint must include all of the necessary information
  for Jaeger to fulfill the request.
- 'Check Proxy Settings: Ensure that your system''s proxy settings are correctly configured.
  Check for any misconfigurations or discrepancies.'
- 'Firewall Rules: Verify that your firewall rules or security policies are not blocking
  the outgoing connection to Logit.io. Adjust your firewall rules if necessary.'
- 'Proxy Authentication: If your proxy server requires authentication, make sure you
  have provided the correct credentials in your proxy configuration.'
- 'Network Configuration: Check if your network has any specific requirements or restrictions
  that may be affecting the connection to external services like Logit.io.'
- 'Contact Support: If you are unable to resolve the issue after checking the above
  steps, it''s advisable to contact our support for further assistance and we can
  help diagnose and resolve more complex connectivity issues.'
- OAuth2 is used for authentication.
- Valid JSON content is required
- API key must be sent in the headers
- Default configuration file is located at C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf
- Telegraf version used is 1.34.1
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You should expect to receive a `202 ACCEPTED` response
- Ensure the API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Some metrics may be delayed in reporting
- Requires Google Cloud project setup with appropriate API access.
- Ensure proper authentication setup to access the API.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Navigating through large volumes of data in OpenSearch often requires an efficient
  approach to pagination.
- 'OpenSearch offers two primary methods for pagination: From/Size Pagination and
  Search After.'
- The from/size approach has performance limitations when dealing with large datasets,
  as it becomes slower and more resource-intensive.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in logit.io
- Uses OpenSearch REST API without any client libraries.
- Ensure all required dependencies are correctly installed.
- Properly handle exceptions for production use, e.g., retry logic for failed requests.
- Deploy enterprise-grade logging in minutes with our fully managed service.
- 99.9% uptime SLA with guaranteed performance.
- ISO 27001 certified security and compliance.
- SOC 2 Type II-compliant
- ISO27001 Certified
- HIPAA-compliant
- GDPR-compliant
- Logit.io's security analytics capabilities allow users to proactively resolve incidents
  and cross communicate with their cybersecurity team
- An effective security analytics platform must be well suited to the data collection
  of large amounts of structured and unstructured data, complex data sets and variations
  of log files.
- Free log viewers often have limitations that are encountered when their use is scaled
  up for ensuring wider IT infrastructure or event monitoring reliability.
