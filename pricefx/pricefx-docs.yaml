auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.pricefx.com/rest-api/integration-guide/:
  - 'JWT token in the Authorization header, and set the Content-Type header to application/json.
    Include the JSON payload in the request body.


    Based on the provided documentation chunk, here is the authentication information:


    Include a JWT token in the Authorization header. Set the Content-Type header to
    application/json when making POST requests to the /loaddata/P endpoint. The exact
    header name is Authorization and it should contain the JWT token value.'
  - JWT token-based authentication is required. Include the JWT token value in the
    `X-PriceFx-jwt` header for all REST API requests. JWT tokens expire in 30 minutes;
    the server auto-reissues a new token as an updated cookie around the 20-minute
    mark, and clients should replace their token accordingly. Alternatively, a non-expiring
    token can be obtained from the /accountmanager.getjsonwebtoken endpoint, though
    this is less secure than time-limited tokens.
  - Make a POST request to the /productmanager.fetchformulafilteredproducts endpoint
    with a JWT token included in the Authorization header.
  - Pricefx API uses JWT token-based authentication. First, obtain a JWT token by
    sending a POST request with basic HTTP authentication (username and password).
    Then, include the JWT token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for
    subsequent API requests.
  - Use JWT token authentication obtained via Basic HTTP Authentication. Send a POST
    request to /login/extended with Basic Authentication credentials to receive a
    JWT token in the X-PriceFx-jwt cookie header, valid for 30 minutes. Include the
    X-PriceFx-jwt header or cookie in subsequent API requests. The token auto-refreshes
    after 20 minutes of the 30-minute expiration window.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.pricefx.com/rest-api/integration-guide/:
  - The documentation describes pagination using `startRow` and `endRow` parameters
    in the request body. `startRow` specifies the starting index (default 0) and `endRow`
    specifies the ending row number for the result set, allowing you to retrieve paginated
    subsets of data from the `/productmanager.fetchformulafilteredproducts` endpoint.
- information_source; https://api.pricefx.com/rest-api/filtering-sorting-pagination/:
  - Pricefx REST API uses `startRow` and `endRow` parameters (both integers, optional)
    in request bodies to paginate fetch-type commands. The response includes a `totalRows`
    field; construct subsequent requests by setting `startRow` to the previous `endRow`
    value. Maximum result size is 1 million rows, enforced for unbounded requests
    or when endRow minus startRow exceeds that limit.
- ? information_source; https://api.pricefx.com/openapi/reference/pricefx/operation/post-productmanager.fetchproductsetcompetition-label/
  : - Pagination uses startRow and endRow parameters in the request body to define
      the result set range. The response includes startRow and data array fields;
      use startRow and endRow values to construct subsequent requests for retrieving
      additional pages.
- ? information_source; https://api.pricefx.com/openapi/reference/pricefx/operation/post-productmanager.fetchproductcompetition/
  : - Pagination uses startRow and endRow parameters in the request body. startRow
      defines the first row of the result set, endRow defines the last row (default
      300). Use these parameters to implement paging by adjusting the row range in
      successive requests.
