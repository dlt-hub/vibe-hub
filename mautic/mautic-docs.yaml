auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.mautic.org:
  - All Mautic API endpoints require either an OAuth1a signature or OAuth2 access
    token for authorization. As of Mautic 2.3.0, Basic Authentication is also supported.
    OAuth errors return a JSON object with "error" and "error_description" fields,
    while system errors return a JSON object with an "error" object containing "message"
    and "code" fields. The Mautic version is included in all API response headers
    under the header name "Mautic-Version" in semantic versioning format.
  - Mautic uses OAuth2 for authentication. Applications can obtain access tokens via
    the Client Credentials grant (for app-only access) or by refreshing tokens using
    a refresh_token grant type. To refresh, POST to oauth/v2/token with parameters
    client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to refresh_token, refresh_token, and
    redirect_uri. The response includes access_token, expires_in, token_type (bearer),
    scope, and refresh_token. Refresh tokens are valid for 14 days by default and
    configurable in Mautic's Configuration. Applications should handle 400 Bad Response
    errors by redirecting users back through authorization.
  - 'Mautic uses OAuth2 with three supported grant types: authorization_code, refresh_token,
    and client_credentials. For authorization_code flow, redirect users to GET /oauth/v2/authorize
    with query parameters client_id, grant_type set to authorization_code, redirect_uri
    (URL encoded), response_type set to code, and an optional state parameter for
    CSRF protection. After user authorization, Mautic redirects to your redirect_uri
    with code and state query parameters appended. Access tokens are obtained and
    validated using methods like validateAccessToken(), accessTokenUpdated(), and
    getAccessTokenData(). Store and manage the returned access token data for authenticated
    requests.'
  - 'OAuth 1.0a authentication is required. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header with the following parameters: oauth_consumer_key (consumer key), oauth_token
    (access token), oauth_signature (HMAC-SHA1 base64-encoded signature of request),
    oauth_nonce (unique string), oauth_signature_method (typically HMAC-SHA1), oauth_timestamp,
    and oauth_callback. The signature is computed using a composite key formatted
    as CLIENT_SECRET&TOKEN_SECRET, where TOKEN_SECRET is empty for /oauth/v1/request_token,
    the oauth_token_secret from /oauth/v1/request_token for /oauth/v1/access_token,
    and the oauth_token_secret from /oauth/v1/access_token for all other endpoints.'
  - 'OAuth 1.0a authentication is required. The flow involves three steps: (1) obtain
    a request token via POST to /oauth/v1/request_token with consumer key and signature,
    (2) redirect user to login endpoint with the request token, receiving oauth_token
    and oauth_verifier in callback, (3) exchange for access token via POST to /oauth/v1/access_token
    with Authorization header containing OAuth parameters including oauth_consumer_key,
    oauth_token, oauth_verifier, oauth_signature (HMAC-SHA1), oauth_nonce, oauth_timestamp,
    and oauth_callback. The oauth_token_secret from step two is used in signature
    generation. All OAuth parameters go in the Authorization header using the format:
    Authorization: OAuth param1="value1", param2="value2", etc.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.mautic.org:
  - 'Pagination for listing form submissions uses query parameters: start (offset),
    limit (page size), orderBy (sort field), and orderByDir (sort direction). Response
    includes total (total count) and submissions array. Use start and limit to navigate
    pages; stop when returned submissions count is less than limit or start exceeds
    total.'
  - 'Pagination is supported via query parameters: start (starting row, optional)
    and limit (number of entities to return, optional). The response returns the same
    notification properties as the Get Notification endpoint. Stop paginating when
    fewer results than the limit are returned.'
  - Pagination is supported via the start and limit query parameters. start specifies
    the starting row (0-indexed) and limit specifies the maximum number of entities
    to return per request. The response structure does not explicitly indicate total
    count or next page information, so continue paginating by incrementing start by
    the limit value until fewer than limit results are returned.
  - Pagination uses limit (default 25), page (starting at 1), total (total records),
    and maxPages (maximum page number). Increment page parameter to retrieve subsequent
    pages until page equals maxPages.
  - Pagination uses limit and page query parameters. The response includes total (total
    count), page (current page number), limit (results per page, default 25), and
    maxPages (total pages available). Continue paginating by incrementing the page
    parameter until page equals maxPages.
