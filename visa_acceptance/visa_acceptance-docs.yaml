auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.visaacceptance.com/api-reference-assets/index.html:
  - HTTP Signature authentication uses a hash-based method with a shared secret key,
    requiring the headers v-c-merchant-id (your organization ID), Date (RFC1123 format),
    Content-Type (application/json), and Host (the API endpoint). Alternatively, JWT
    authentication is available using a P12 Certificate. Authorization headers are
    generated based on the request payload for each request.
  - The Visa Acceptance Platform REST API uses HTTP Signature authentication. You
    must include specific HTTP headers with every API request to both sandbox (https://apitest.visaacceptance.com)
    and production (https://api.visaacceptance.com) endpoints. Upon sandbox signup,
    you receive an API login and API key used to authenticate requests. The documentation
    indicates that HTTP headers are required for authentication, though the specific
    header names and signature format details are not fully provided in this excerpt.

  - HTTP Signature authentication is supported, which uses a Base64-encoded shared
    secret key (transaction key) as a hash-based method. The documentation indicates
    there are two forms of authentication available but only HTTP Signature is partially
    described in the provided text.
