auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.investsuite.com/concepts/authentication/:
  - Authenticate using an access key and secret to receive a JSON Web Token (JWT).
    Add the JWT token to API requests for authorization. Exact header name and parameter
    details for token submission are not provided in this excerpt.
  - Authentication uses JWT tokens obtained via the `/auth/login` endpoint. Send a
    POST request with `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` in the JSON body to
    receive an `access_token` and `refresh_token`. Include the `access_token` in the
    HTTP Authorization header for all subsequent requests. The `access_token` expires
    after a duration specified in the `expires_at` field and can be refreshed using
    the `/auth/refresh-token` endpoint. All requests must use HTTPS; HTTP requests
    will fail.
  - 'Authentication uses access key credentials exchanged for bearer tokens. POST
    access_key_id and secret_access_key to /auth/login/ to receive an access_token
    with token_type Bearer and expires_in 300 seconds, plus a refresh_token. Use the
    refresh_token with /auth/refresh-token/ to obtain a new access_token. Include
    the access_token in subsequent requests via Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
    header.'
  - 'The API uses JWT Bearer token authentication. After obtaining an `access_token`
    from the authentication endpoint, include it in all subsequent requests via the
    `Authorization` header as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token_string}`. Requests
    without this header will return a 403 Access Forbidden error.'
- information_source; https://docs.investsuite.com/insight-apis/authentication_usage/:
  - 'Authenticate using two required headers: X-TENANT-ID containing your tenant-user
    identifier and X-Api-Key containing your secret key. Both credentials must be
    included in the request header for all API calls, and all requests must use HTTPS.
    Obtain credentials by contacting your InvestSuite representative or emailing api@investsuite.com.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.investsuite.com/concepts/embedding/:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a limit query parameter (default or
    example value 10) to control page size. The response includes a next field containing
    the full URL for the next page, an offset field with the cursor value, and a results
    array with the paginated data. To paginate, use the next URL or extract the offset
    value and pass it as the offset query parameter in subsequent requests.
