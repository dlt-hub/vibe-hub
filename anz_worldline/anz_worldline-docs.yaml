  - Webhook validation requires a key and secret. Send the webhooks key configured
    in your account and a base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of an empty string using
    your webhooks secret to the ValidateWebhookCredentials endpoint. Include {merchantId}
    as a path parameter. The request body contains key (string) and secret (base64-encoded
    string) fields.
- information_source; https://docs.anzworldline-solutions.com.au/en/api-reference:
  - Webhook credentials validation requires sending a key and secret in the request
    body. The key is a webhook identifier string, and the secret is a hashed value
    computed by hashing an empty string with your webhook key using the same hashing
    method used in your system. Authentication failure returns a 403 status code.

  : - The API uses HMAC-based authentication. Initialize the client with V1HmacAuthenticator
      using your API key and API secret, then specify your PSPID when making requests
      to the merchant endpoint.
- ? information_source; https://docs.anzworldline-solutions.com.au/en/integration/basic-integration-methods/hosted-tokenization-page
  : - HMAC authentication is used with an API key and API secret passed to V1HmacAuthenticator.
      The authenticator is then provided to the client factory along with a metadata
      provider and connection configuration, and requests are made through a client
      interface using a merchant ID in the request path.
    - 'Your application authenticates to the platform using HMAC-based authentication
      with an API key and API secret. Initialize the V1HmacAuthenticator with your
      API key and API secret, then use it with the DefaultConnection to communicate
      with the environment-specific endpoint (e.g., https://payment.preprod.anzworldline-solutions.com.au
      for TEST).


      Key details: The authenticator class is V1HmacAuthenticator, constructor parameters
      are API key (first) and API secret (second). The MetadataProvider is initialized
      with "OnlinePayments". Requests are sent via DefaultConnection configured with
      these credentials to the respective environment URL.'
