notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When using file name placeholders, in particular when using {tag_list}, you may
  run into the limits of your operating system's maximum path lengths.
- If paperless detects that two documents share the same filename, paperless will
  automatically append _01, _02, etc to the filename.
- If there are any errors in the placeholders included in PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT,
  paperless will fall back to using the default naming scheme instead.
- Defining a storage path is optional. If no storage path is defined for a document,
  the global PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT is applied.
- Paperless will attempt to 'clean' certain invalid PDFs with qpdf before processing.
- Paperless will remove the staging copy as well as the scan if the first scan has
  less pages than the second scan.
- The scan files need to be consumed in the correct order, and one at a time.
- Session authentication allows automatic login when logged in through the browser.
- If you run paperless on docker, `paperless.conf` is not used.
- Defaults to `redis://localhost:6379`.
- Defaults to `../consume/`, relative to the 'src' directory.
- Defaults to `../data/`, relative to the 'src' directory.
- Defaults to empty (i.e. really delete files).
- Defaults to `../media/`, relative to the 'src' directory.
- Defaults to `../static/`, relative to the 'src' directory.
- Defaults to `PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR/log/`.
- Defaults to `/usr/share/nltk_data`.
- If you're planning on putting Paperless on the open internet, then you really should
  set this value to the domain name you're using.
- Use any sequence of characters for PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY.
- If your language contains a '-', such as chi-sim, you must use chi_sim.
- Deskewing is incompatible with ocr mode redo. Deskewing will get disabled automatically
  if redo is used as the ocr mode.
- This option may also be set with GRANIAN_WORKERS and this option may be removed
  in the future
- This option may also be set with GRANIAN_HOST and this option may be removed in
  the future
- This option may also be set with GRANIAN_PORT and this option may be removed in
  the future
- Ensure that the directory you're putting your documents in is the folder paperless
  is watching.
- Ensure that redis is up and running.
- Paperless always redirects to /admin if you had the old paperless installed.
- This happens when pointing these directories to NFS shares.
- Paperless-ngx supports OAuth2 authentication for Gmail and Outlook email accounts.
- Share links do not require a user to login.
- For email sharing, an email server must be configured.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '406 Not Acceptable: Invalid API version specified.'
- Ensure that any header is not passed from external requests to your reverse-proxy
  to paperless.
- Permission denied errors in the consumption directory
