auth_info:
- information_source; https://shopping-api-docs.paylogic.com/documentation/personalization.html:
  - Authenticate the request with a Personalization request token sent as a Personalization-Request-Token
    request header. This token is used when someone other than the order creator needs
    to personalize a ticket.
- information_source; https://shopping-api-docs.paylogic.com/documentation/personalization_request.html:
  - Authenticate the creation of a personalization request using a Cognito token or
    Order token. These tokens should be sent as authentication credentials; see the
    authentication concepts documentation for specific header and parameter details.
- information_source; https://shopping-api-docs.paylogic.com/documentation/refund_bill.html:
  - The request must be authenticated using either an Order token or Cognito token
    belonging to the order of the tickets. These tokens should be sent as credentials
    in the request headers (the exact header name is not specified in this excerpt,
    but typically would be Authorization or a custom auth header). The specific token
    type depends on whether you are authenticating as the order owner (Order token)
    or through AWS Cognito (Cognito token).
  - This endpoint requires authentication using either an Order token or a Cognito
    token that belongs to the order of the tickets. The token must be sent with the
    request, though the specific header or parameter name for token transmission is
    not explicitly stated in this documentation excerpt.
