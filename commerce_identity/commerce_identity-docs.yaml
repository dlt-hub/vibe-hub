auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/apiz.ebay.com/commerce-identity/v1.1.0/openapi.json:
  - This API uses OAuth2 with the authorization code flow. Authentication requires
    obtaining an access token from https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize and sending
    it in requests. Multiple scopes are available for different user identity data
    access levels, including address, email, name, and phone information.
  - This method requires a User access token passed in the Authorization header with
    the Bearer scheme. The specific data returned depends on the scopes included in
    the token; the default scope is commerce.identity.readonly for business accounts,
    while individual accounts return data based on their assigned scopes.
  - 'eBay API uses OAuth2 authentication. Tokens are obtained from https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token.
    Three scopes are available: commerce.identity.phone.readonly for phone information,
    commerce.identity.readonly for basic user info, and commerce.identity.status.readonly
    for account status. Include the access token in the Authorization header as a
    bearer token when making requests.'
  - eBay uses OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". The fields returned in responses
    are controlled by OAuth scopes, which are approved on a per-developer basis by
    eBay business units.
