auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/isoline-routing-api-migration-guide-v8/page/README.html:
  - Isoline Routing v8 uses apiKey as a query parameter or OAuth bearer token in the
    request headers as the authentication method, replacing the v7 app_id and app_code
    parameters. The request ID is now passed as the X-Request-ID HTTP header instead
    of a requestId query parameter.
  - Token or API key authentication is supported; legacy app_id and app_code credentials
    are deprecated and users should migrate to token or API key authentication as
    described in the Identity and Access Management Developer Guide.
- information_source; https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/isoline-routing-api-migration-guide-v8:
  - Isoline Routing v8 uses apiKey parameter or OAuth bearer token in request headers
    for authentication, replacing the v7 app_id/app_code scheme. The apiKey can be
    sent as a query parameter, while OAuth bearer tokens go in the Authorization header.
    Refer to the Identity and Access Management Developer Guide for current authentication
    methods and available usage plans.
  - Token or API key authentication is supported; legacy app_id and app_code credentials
    are deprecated and should be migrated to token or API key authentication as described
    in the Identity and Access Management Developer Guide.
- information_source; https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-migration-guide-v8/page/README.html:
  - The app code credentials are not supported in v8. Authentication methods are available
    through the Identity & Access Management Guide. For specific details on current
    authentication methods, refer to that guide, as this migration document does not
    provide explicit authentication mechanism details (such as header names, parameter
    names, or credential formats).
