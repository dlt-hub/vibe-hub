notes:
- Learn how to create conversational voice agents with Bolna AI to qualify leads,
  boost sales, automate customer support, and streamline recruitment and hiring
- Choosing telephone only if you want your agent to make telephone calls.
- Requires setup of connected app in Bolna
- Ensure to handle multiple languages in responses

- All phone numbers should include the country prefix in E.164 format
- All phone numbers should have contact_number as the header
- The scheduled date and time should be in ISO 8601 format with time zone
- Multiple codes may map to a single hangup_by status depending on the network or
  device behavior.
- Codes like 4000 appear in multiple categories (API, caller, callee) - interpretation
  depends on context and direction of the call (inbound vs outbound).
- Carrier-related hangups are often location-sensitive. If youâ€™re noticing frequent
  3010 or 3050 codes in a specific region, consider checking local routing or carrier
  coverage.

- On-premise is available only for enterprise customers.
- The API Key will be shown only once. Hence, please save it somewhere secure.
