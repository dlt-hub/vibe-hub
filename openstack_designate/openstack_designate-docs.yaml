  community.
- Current API versions are preferred.
- Deprecated versions may be removed in the future.
- Documentation Contributor Guide provides detailed instructions on the contribution
  workflow.
- Support for the new OpenStack release will be available shortly after the release
  of Pike.
- Various bug fixes and minor improvements in the host scripts.
- Outages can cause partial or full loss of site functionality.
- Strategies should be implemented to understand and plan for recovery scenarios.
- The deployed applications need to continue to function and, more importantly, you
  must consider the impact on the performance and reliability of the application when
  a site is unavailable.
- It is important to understand what happens to the replication of objects and data
  between the sites when a site goes down. If this causes queues to start building
  up, consider how long these queues can safely exist until an error occurs.
- After an outage, ensure the method for resuming proper operations of a site is implemented
  when it comes back online. We recommend you architect the recovery to avoid race
  conditions.
- Cheaper storage makes the public cloud suitable for maintaining backup applications.
- Hybrid cloud architecture enables the migration of applications between different
  clouds.
- Business changes can affect provider availability.
- Changes in a provider’s service can disrupt a hybrid cloud environment or increase
  costs.
- Consumers of external clouds rarely have control over provider changes to APIs,
  and changes can break compatibility.
- Using only the most common and basic APIs can minimize potential conflicts.
- As of the Kilo release, there is no common image format that is usable by all clouds.
- Conversion or recreation of images is necessary if migrating between clouds.
- To simplify deployment, use the smallest and simplest images feasible, install only
  what is necessary, and use a deployment manager such as Chef or Puppet.
- Do not use golden images to speed up the process unless you repeatedly deploy the
  same images on the same cloud.
- Avoid using a hybrid cloud deployment with more than just OpenStack (or with different
  versions of OpenStack) as API changes can cause compatibility issues.
- Organizations leveraging cloud-based services can embrace business diversity and
  utilize a hybrid cloud design to spread their workloads across multiple cloud providers.
  This ensures that no single cloud provider is the sole host for an application.
- If the data store is highly changeable, the network requirements could have a significant
  effect on the operational cost of maintaining the sites.
- When running embedded object store methods, ensure that you do not instigate extra
  data replication as this may cause performance issues.
- We recommend that you use a fast NIC, such as 10 GB.
- You can also choose to use two 10 GB NICs and bond them together.
- OpenStack is designed to be massively horizontally scalable.
- The cloud controller provides the central management system for OpenStack deployments.
- OpenStack Identity supports different plug-ins for authentication decisions and
  identity storage.
- It may be necessary to implement a third party caching layer for some applications
  to achieve suitable performance.
- There are special considerations around erasure coded pools. For example, higher
  computational requirements and limitations on the operations allowed on an object;
  erasure coded pools do not support partial writes.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The OpenStack Operations Guide was published in 2014, the last partial update was
  in 2017.
- The guide thus might not apply anymore to current releases.
- Panduan ini memberikan informasi tentang pengoperasian cloud OpenStack.
- Kami menyarankan Anda beralih ke Installation Tutorials and Guides, yang berisi
  panduan langkah demi langkah tentang cara menginstal paket OpenStack dan dependensi
  secara manual pada cloud Anda.
- Be mindful of consistency when utilizing third party clouds to explore authentication
  options.
- Use cases for OpenStack are varied.
- You can save resources by looking at the best fit for the hardware you have in place
  already.
- Using the Identity API requires authentication against the service named keystone.
- The token allows you to interact with your other service endpoints without needing
  to reauthenticate for every request.
- Tokens are typically good for 24 hours, and when the token expires, you are alerted
  with a 401 (Unauthorized) response.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of connected app in api
- Default quotas are shipped with OpenStack. You should pay attention to which quota
  settings make sense for your hardware capabilities.
- Default quotas are enforced at the tenant level.
- Users can be associated with multiple projects.
- Admin role gives global administrative rights.
- This guide is for OpenStack operators and does not seek to be an exhaustive reference
  for users.
- The OpenStack volume service cannot tell whether it is safe to remove volumes from
  an instance, so it does what it is told.
- Some commands may require administrative permissions.
- Shared File Systems service cannot warn you beforehand if it is safe to write a
  specific large amount of data onto a certain share.
- Do not mount a share without an access rule! This can lead to an exception.
- Downtime, whether planned or unscheduled, is a certainty when running a cloud.
- Existing instances and volumes continue to operate while the cloud controller is
  offline if using FlatDHCP multi-host HA network mode.
- No storage traffic is possible until the storage proxy is back up and running.
- In an elastic cloud environment using the Public_AGILE network, floating IP addresses
  are not supported.
- Because of the high redundancy of Object Storage, dealing with object storage node
  issues is a lot easier than dealing with compute node issues.
- Use this example priority list to ensure that user-affected services are restored
  as soon as possible, but not before a stable environment is in place.
- Each step requires significant work. For example, just after starting the database,
  you should check its integrity, or, after starting the nova services, you should
  verify that the hypervisor matches the database and fix any mismatches.
- Several configuration-management tools are available, and this guide does not recommend
  a specific one.
- Failures of hardware are common in large-scale deployments such as an infrastructure
  cloud.
- The RabbitMQ service name may vary depending on your operating system or vendor
  who supplies your RabbitMQ service.
- Since the Liberty release, OpenStack services will automatically recover from a
  RabbitMQ outage.
- The -H flag is required when running the daemons with sudo because some daemons
  will write files relative to the user’s home directory, and this write may fail
  if -H is left off.
- If OpenStack Identity service is responding slowly, it could be due to the token
  table getting large.
- OpenStack Image service can be slowed down by things related to the Identity service.
- OpenStack Block Storage service is similar to the Image service.
- Slowness in the OpenStack Networking service can be caused by services that it relies
  upon.
- Common issues with AMQP broker can slow down operations.
- A large or fragmented SQLite file can cause slowness when using files as a back
  end.
- Remove all packages.
- Remove remaining files.
- Remove databases.
- Network troubleshooting can be challenging.
- Use ping to quickly find where a failure exists in the network path.
- One great way of troubleshooting network issues is to use tcpdump.
- DHCP issues might be caused by a misbehaving dnsmasq process.
- If your instances are still not able to obtain IP addresses, check whether dnsmasq
  is seeing the DHCP requests.
- If you do not see the DHCPDISCOVER, a problem exists with the packet getting from
  the instance to the machine running dnsmasq.
- If restarting the dnsmasq process doesn’t fix the issue, you might need to use tcpdump
  to look at the packets.
- As an OpenStack cloud is composed of so many different services, there are a large
  number of log files.
- This chapter aims to assist you in locating and working with them and describes
  other ways to track the status of your deployment.
- Most services use the convention of writing their log files to subdirectories of
  the /var/log directory.
- For stable operations, you want to detect failure promptly and determine causes
  efficiently.
- With a distributed system, it’s even more important to track the right items to
  meet a service-level target.
- Standard backup best practices apply when creating your OpenStack backup policy.
- If you cannot have any data loss at all, focus on a highly available deployment.
- This example is for illustrative purposes only. It should not be used as a scheduler
  for Compute without further development and testing.
- Thoroughly review the release notes to learn about new, updated, and deprecated
  features.
- Consider the impact of an upgrade to users.
- Upgrading from one version of OpenStack to another can take a great deal of effort.
- The upgrade process interrupts management of your environment including the dashboard.
- If you removed the release repositories, you must first reinstall them and run the
  apt-get update command.
- The process of manually picking through this list of packages is rather tedious
  and prone to errors. You should consider using a script to help with this process.
- Uses Puppet for configuration management.
- Three clouds currently running at CERN.
- The EC2 API responds slowly to particular requests such as RunInstances.
- Memory consumption increases while the EC2 API processes requests, potentially leading
  to system slowdowns.
- The purpose of this document is to provide the best practice guidelines for deploying
  a secure OpenStack cloud.
- This document is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
- Security domains should be mapped out against your specific OpenStack deployment
  topology.
- The trust level of the data security domain is heavily dependent on deployment decisions.
- Your selection of supporting software, such as messaging and load balancing, can
  have serious security impacts on your cloud.
- It is important that you make the proper choices for your organization.
- Administrators must perform command and control over the cloud for various operational
  functions.
- 'OpenStack releases security information through two channels: OSSA and OSSN.'
- Best practice is to use the lsmod command to show what is regularly being loaded
  on a system to help determine what should or should not be included in FIM checks.
- Utilizing secure boot will require deeper integration and customization than many
  of the other recommendations in this guide.
- The API service should be configured for TLS to ensure data is encrypted.
- OpenStack API is susceptible to familiar web site attack vectors such as denial
  of service attacks.
- Strongly recommend that TLS is used in preference to SSL.
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is recommended for securing communication.
- It is highly recommended that all requests operate over TLS.
- The recommended configuration settings for enabling TLS in various web servers.
- Cipher string options are separated by ':', while '!' provides negation.
- Uses SSL/TLS to protect publicly facing services.
- High value assets that can pose a significant risk if compromised.
- Rate limiting is recommended for all endpoints, especially public.
- Employ multi-factor authentication for network access to privileged user accounts.
- The Identity service supports external authentication services through the Apache
  web server that can provide this functionality.
- We recommend that you use client authentication with TLS for the authentication
  of services to the Identity service.
- Each OpenStack service defines the access policies for its resources in an associated
  policy file.
- Token can have a variable life span; however the default value for expiry is one
  hour.
- Recommended expiry value should be set to a lower value that allows enough time
  for internal services to complete tasks.
- Tokens can be revoked using the identity API.
- Domain-specific authentication drivers allow the Identity service to be configured
  for multiple domains using domain-specific configuration files.
- Enabling the drivers and setting the domain-specific configuration file location
  occur in the `[identity]` section of the `keystone.conf` file.
- If TLS is not enabled on the HTTP server, it may lead to eavesdropping on sensitive
  information.
- Setting strict permissions for configuration files is crucial to avoid unauthorized
  access.
- We strongly recommend deploying dashboard to a second-level domain, such as https://example.com,
  rather than deploying dashboard on a shared subdomain of any level.
- If you do not follow this recommendation regarding second-level domains, avoid a
  cookie-backed session store and employ HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- It is highly recommended to use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- The default session back end for horizon saves user data in signed, but unencrypted
  cookies stored in the browser.
- If your architecture allows for shared storage and if you have configured your cache
  correctly, we recommend setting your SESSION_ENGINE to 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'
  and using it as cache-based session backend with memcached as the cache.
- The dashboard’s static media should be deployed to a subdomain of the dashboard
  domain and served by the web server.
- The use of an external content delivery network (CDN) is also acceptable.
- This subdomain should not set cookies or serve user-provided content.
- The media should also be served with HTTPS.
- Compression should be done in a non-production build environment.
- If this is not practical, we recommend disabling resource compression entirely.
- The secret key should be a randomly generated string at least 64 characters long,
  which must be shared across all active dashboard instances.
- Compromise of this key may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- Rotating this key invalidates existing user sessions and caching.
- Do not commit this key to public repositories.
- Session cookies should be set to HTTPONLY
- Never configure CSRF or session cookies to have a wild card domain with a leading
  dot
- Horizon’s session and CSRF cookie should be secured when deployed with HTTPS
- 'Configure your web server to send a restrictive CORS header with each response,
  allowing only the dashboard domain and protocol: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com/'
- Never allow the wild card origin.
- We recommend that the DEBUG setting is set to False in production environments.
- If DEBUG is set to True, Django will display stack traces and sensitive web server
  state information when exceptions are thrown.
- Default setting for DISALLOW_IFRAME_EMBED is True.
- Default setting for CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE is True.
- Default setting for SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is True.
- Default setting for SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY is True.
- OpenStack has not undergone Common Criteria certification, however many of the available
  hypervisors have.
- Uses Secure Encrypted Virtualization technology to encrypt the memory of VMs on
  AMD-based machines.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Monitoring is a critical component of IT infrastructure, we recommend the Compute
  logfiles be monitored and analyzed so that meaningful alerts can be created.
- We recommend keeping up to date on security issues and advisories as they are published.
- Keep up to date on security issues and advisories as they are published.
- The functionality and integration are still evolving.
- We recommend using SPICE from the management network in addition to limiting use
  to few individuals.
- All services must be authenticated with keystone using their service accounts.
- If the noauth strategy is used, users could interact with OpenStack services without
  any authentication.
- Whilst this chapter is currently sparse on specific guidance, it is expected that
  standard hardening practices will be followed.
- In older OpenStack releases, lvm_type=default was used to signify a wipe. While
  this method still works, lvm_type=default is not recommended for setting secure
  delete.
- All components must communicate with each other using a secured communication protocol.
- 'Check-Block-01: Is user/group ownership of config files set to root/cinder?'
- 'Check-Block-02: Are strict permissions set for configuration files?'
- 'Check-Block-03: Is keystone used for authentication?'
- 'Check-Block-04: Is TLS enabled for authentication?'
- 'Check-Block-05: Does cinder communicate with nova over TLS?'
- 'Check-Block-06: Does cinder communicate with glance over TLS?'
- 'Check-Block-07: Is NAS operating in a secure environment?'
- 'Check-Block-08: Is max size for the body of a request set to default (114688)?'
- 'Check-Block-09: Is the volume encryption feature enabled?'
- If the noauth strategy is used, then users can interact with OpenStack services
  without any authentication.
- Is OpenStack Identity used for authentication?
- Is TLS enabled for authentication?
- The default port for the Shared File Systems service is 8786.
- In no share servers mode, the Shared File Systems service assumes that network interfaces
  are reachable by all tenants.
- In share servers mode, a driver can create and manage a share server for each share
  network.
- Different authentication services are supported by different share drivers.
- The recommended configuration for the Shared File Systems service real usage is
  to create a share with the CIFS share protocol and add to it the Microsoft Active
  Directory directory service.
- By default, all shares are created as private.
- Supported authentication methods depend on which share driver, security service
  and shared file system protocol you configure and use.
- The RO access level can be helpful in public shares.
- When a share is just created there are no default access rules associated with it.
- Share types can be created as public and private.
- By default, share types are created as public.
- The configuration file `policy.json` may be placed anywhere. The path `/etc/manila/policy.json`
  is expected by default.
- Any changes to `/etc/manila/policy.json` are effective immediately, which allows
  new policies to be implemented while the Shared File Systems service is running.
  Manual modification of the policy can have unexpected side effects and is not encouraged.
- If the maximum body size per request is not defined, the attacker can craft an arbitrary
  OSAPI request of large size causing the service to crash and finally resulting in
  a Denial Of Service attack.
- Is keystone used for authentication?
- Is secure protocol used for authentication?
- Is TLS enabled on Neutron API server?
- OpenStack Networking adds a layer of virtualized network services which gives tenants
  the capability to architect their own virtual networks.
- VLAN configuration complexity depends on your OpenStack design requirements.
- To restrict the interface or IP address on which the OpenStack Networking API service
  binds a network socket for incoming client connections, specify the bind_host and
  bind_port in the neutron.conf file.
- It is important to review the default networking resource policy, as this policy
  can be modified to suit your security posture.
- Object Storage does not employ encryption or authentication with inter-node communications.
- An Object Storage installation does not have to be on the Internet and could also
  be a private cloud.
- Castellan does not provide any authentication. It simply passes through the authentication
  credentials.
- Barbican expects and authenticates a keystone authentication token.
- There is no current solution to obfuscate these passwords. It is recommended that
  these files be appropriately secured by file permissions.
- The Vault plugin does not support multitenancy, thus all secrets will be stored
  under the same Key/Value secret engine mountpoint.
- Recommended way to securely store secrets is to use Barbican.
- Secrets that require a keystone token should be stored using Barbican.
- Once access to the queue is permitted, no further authorization checks are performed.
- You must secure and authenticate the message transport itself.
- Use both mandatory access controls (MACs) and discretionary access controls (DACs)
  to restrict the configuration for processes to only those processes.
- Uses TLS for secure communication.
- Ensure file permissions are restricted for certificate and key files.
- Default assumption for a data processing installation is that users will have access
  to all functionality within their projects.
- Data processing interacts directly with several OpenStack services.
- For production environments we recommend controlling the security groups manually
  and creating a set of group rules that are appropriate for the installation.
- All database communications be isolated to a management network
- Securing communications using TLS
- Creating unique database user accounts per OpenStack service endpoint
- Ensure that the file permissions are restricted, for example chmod 0600, and the
  ownership is restricted to the database daemon user to prevent unauthorized access
  by other processes and users on the database server.
- OpenStack is designed to support multitenancy and those tenants will most probably
  have different data requirements.
