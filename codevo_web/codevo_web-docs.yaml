auth_info:
- information_source; https://codevoweb.com/building-a-rust-api-with-unit-testing-in-mind/:
  - The API uses token-based authentication via cookies or Authorization headers.
    Tokens are decoded to extract a user ID, which is verified against the database.
    User access is controlled by role-based authorization, where the user's role must
    match allowed roles to proceed; otherwise a 403 Forbidden error is returned. If
    no token is found, a 401 Unauthorized error is returned.
- information_source; https://codevoweb.com/implement-jwt-authentication-in-sveltekit-api-routes/:
  - 'JWT is used for authentication. A token is created and returned in the JSON response.
    Additionally, two cookies are set: a ''token'' cookie containing the JWT (httpOnly,
    secure in production, path ''/api'', maxAge based on JWT_EXPIRES_IN environment
    variable in seconds), and a ''logged-in'' cookie set to ''true'' (httpOnly false,
    same path and maxAge). The JWT_EXPIRES_IN environment variable controls token
    expiration in seconds.'
  - JWT-based authentication is required. The auth token is retrieved from cookies
    or the Authorization header, then verified using verifyJWT to extract the sub
    claim. The sub value is used to look up the user in the database. Invalid or missing
    tokens, or non-existent users, return 401 Unauthorized errors.
  - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. After logging in via POST to
    `/api/auth/login` with email and password in the JSON body, you receive a JWT
    token in the response. Access protected routes by sending the token either as
    a Bearer token in the Authorization header or via cookies with subsequent requests
    to endpoints like GET `/api/users/me`.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://codevoweb.com/build-a-crud-django-rest-api-using-django-rest-framework/:
  - 'The API supports pagination via query parameters: page and limit in the URL query
    string to control paginated results from the GET /api/feedbacks endpoint. No response
    fields or stopping conditions are specified.'
- information_source; https://codevoweb.com/how-to-build-a-simple-api-in-sveltekit/:
  - Use query parameters page (required, starts at 1) and limit (required, default
    10) to paginate feedback results. The response includes paginated feedback items;
    construct the next request by incrementing the page parameter until no more results
    are returned.
