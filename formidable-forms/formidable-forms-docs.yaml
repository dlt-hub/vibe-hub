notes:
- Formidable does not include empty fields when form entries are saved. If you want
  to update a field that was empty at form submission, you have to add it to the frm_entry_metas
  table first, then you can update it.
- You must be logged in to ask a question.
- Must be logged in to ask a question.
- You're receiving a false positive. Formidable uses WordPress nonce. A WordPress
  nonce, short for 'number used once,' is a security token used to protect URLs and
  forms from malicious attacks, particularly Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). While
  the name implies 'used once,' WordPress nonces actually have a limited 'lifetime'
  during which they can be used for a specific action by a specific user.
- There is no save timer in Formidable.
- Automatically generates a branded PDF copy of any submitted form and attaches it
  to admin and client confirmation emails.
- Allows selection of fields, application of logos and colors, and auto-naming of
  files.
- There's no shortcode that does this unless you write one yourself.
- Require Confirmation option is missing for phone fields.
- Ensure WP Debugging is turned on to capture logs.
- Problem with form code validation causing issues with some browsers.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Strategy 11 regularly runs deeply discounted sales on Formidable's licenses.
- Formidable doesn't save empty fields, so there's no way to download a CSV containing
  empty fields. Use default values.
- All Formidable fields accept default values.
- Formidable doesn't save data for fields that are left blank. Make sure fields have
  default values.
- The signature field sends a file path, this path contains characters that affect
  the data structure in RAW format.
- Use [x show=url] in the API action, where x is the ID of the signature field.
- API only works for Administrator and non logged in users
- WordPress uses admin-ajax all the time as do many other plugins.
- File Upload fields are not working after WordPress and Formidable Pro updates.
- Existing Form Upload fields may not work while new ones do.
- This method for displaying the actual value of the field as the range sliders are
  adjusted is to display a separate text string wrapped in HTML span tags.
- Only fields outside a repeater will work for conditions in mail actions.
- Trim last comma from view repeater value list
- Uses WordPress hooks for data insertion.
- Uniqueness of entries is enforced per user, not globally.
- Dynamic BCC list can be created using shortcodes.
- Shortcode for adding an edit link to a repeater view.
- Parent form ID must be provided without brackets.
- Repeaters are CSS grids. To increase/decrease space between fields, you may have
  to adjust the column and row gaps.
- Fields within a repeater are indexed based on the parent field ID.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'No logs generated: Check WP Debugging configuration.'
- 'Form ID mismatch: Verify the form ID in the code.'
- Validation error in the formidable form code.
- '400: Bad Request when sending a drawn signature.'
- 403 - Sorry, you are not allowed to create entries
- '503 server error: Check server logs and configurations.'
- No change in value, stop email from sending.
