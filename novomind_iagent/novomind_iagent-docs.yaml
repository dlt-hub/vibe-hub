- information_source; https://apps.novomind.com/developer/iagent/rest/security.html:
  - 'The novomind iAGENT REST API uses OAuth2 with three supported grant types: Authorization
    Code Grant, Implicit Grant, and Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant. Clients
    must register with a client_id and client_secret, then request an access token
    from the token endpoint at <host>/iMail/api/rest/token. The authorization endpoint
    is <host>/iMail/api/rest/auth for supervisor users or <host>/agent/api/rest/auth
    for agent users. Access tokens are bearer tokens and must be sent in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>".'
- information_source; https://apps.novomind.com/developer/ipim/rest-server-openapi/authentication.html:
  - iPIM 4.4.04 implements OAuth 2.0 as the central authorization server, supporting
    resource owner password, client credentials, authorization code, and refresh token
    flows. Clients must be configured with an API user to access the REST API, and
    can obtain access and refresh tokens through the authorization code flow or other
    supported grant types, with token introspection, revocation, and PKCE extension
    support available.
  - 'iPIM Server REST API supports two authentication approaches. First, custom headers:
    iPIM-User, iPIM-Pass, and iPIM-ClientId are required; iPIM-ClientLevelId and iPIM-ExportResponseObjects
    are optional. Second, OAuth 2.0 authentication is available as an alternative
    method. Send credentials via request headers for header-based auth or use OAuth
    2.0 tokens for token-based auth.'
  - 'iPIM uses OAuth2 authorization code flow for API access. Create an API user with
    nickname as client ID and password as client secret (apiuser: true). Client must
    use Authorization URL at <iPIM-Server>/iPIM/authorize and Access Token URL at
    <iPIM-Server>/iPIM/rest/api/oauth2/token. Include scope parameter with format
    client:<iPIM client> and available scopes: ipim-core.api, ipim-supply.api:read,
    ipim-supply.api:write, ipim-web.api:read, ipim-web.api:write. Redirection URL
    must match the OAUTH2_REDIRECTION_URI user AV if configured. Access and refresh
    tokens are JWS (signed JWTs) for stateless authentication; tokens become invalid
    if the authorization server generates a new key pair.'
- information_source; https://apps.novomind.com/developer/ishop/rest/authentication.html:
  - OAuth2 token-based authentication is required. Use backoffice user credentials
    to request a token; leave the scope empty for REST Shop API or use scope value
    `management` for Management GraphQL API. Include the obtained token in subsequent
    requests.
