auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.losant.com/rest-api/overview/:
  - 'Device authentication uses a two-step process: first, POST a JSON body containing
    deviceId, key, and secret to https://api.losant.com/auth/device to obtain a bearer
    token; then, include that token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}"
    for subsequent API requests. Devices are restricted to access only resources within
    their assigned application.'
  - Device-based authentication uses an API access token with the scope `all.Device`
    obtained from an application access key. An authenticated device can access endpoints
    accepting the `all.Device` scope, including reading its own information, sending
    state, querying historical state and commands, and sending commands to other devices
    if the access key permits. Device permissions are limited to the application it
    belongs to and expand based on the access key configuration (single device, multiple
    devices, or all devices).
  - 'Most endpoints require a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Obtain
    tokens via Auth endpoints (user or device authentication) or Application API Tokens
    resource; the response contains a token field to use as "Authorization": "Bearer
    your-api-token-goes-here". User-authenticated tokens have scope all.User with
    full system access, while application tokens default to scope all.Application
    and can only access resources within their application.'
  - 'User authentication is performed by posting email and password credentials to
    the /auth/user endpoint, which returns a token and userId. The token is then used
    in subsequent API requests via the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme
    (format: "Authorization: Bearer <token>"). Authenticated users can access or modify
    resources they own or that belong to organizations they are part of, subject to
    their permissions.'

  - The OpenWeather API requires an API key passed as the APPID query parameter in
    the URL. Replace the APPID placeholder in the query string with your API key obtained
    from OpenWeather registration. The API endpoint URL format is https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=LATITUDE&lon=LONGITUDE&APPID=APIKEY
    where APPID is your authentication credential.
