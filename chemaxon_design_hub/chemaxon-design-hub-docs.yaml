notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Chemaxon
- Since this version only Java 17 is supported.
- When the 'Stereo Comment Check' switcher is ON and the stereo comment is missing,
  the submission is not failing and not ending up in the Staging area during registration.
- Additional data fields without values are missing from the downstream message.
- By default the Search page will return no search results. You need to add the search
  criteria in order to have the registered items displayed.
- If you experience issues with login, please find information here about how to resolve
  conflicting usernames, resolve administrator lock-out and granting administrator
  privileges for SAML users.
- It was not possible to bulk register submissions with edited structures, the records
  were registered with their original structures, not with the modified ones
- Staging table was empty when running Oracle on certain localizations
- Uses Basic authentication for requests
- Bearer token is used for SaaS environments
- Endpoint names are case-sensitive.
- Structures can be inserted from any non-binary format of chemical files, like sdf,
  mrv, smiles.
- ID values are taken from the file, if specified in the file to be uploaded, otherwise
  are autogenerated.
- The failed and the successful IDs are given back in the response.
- Marvin JS does not support compatibility mode in Internet Explorer.
- If the JS content and requested services are hosted on different domains, the browser
  may block the JS request through the services.
- Requires installation of Chemaxon REST web services product
- The results are in a large data structure, so the template will be used to simplify
  it for the chemists.
- X-API-KEY is required for all requests.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires setup of API client in ChemAxon.
