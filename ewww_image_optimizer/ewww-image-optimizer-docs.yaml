notes:
- WebP conversion is possible for every PNG, JPG, and GIF image on your entire WordPress
  site.
- When using the Compress API or Easy IO, color profiles will be preserved regardless
  of the setting.
- In Premium Plus mode, for both JPG and PNG, the only fields that are preserved are
  copyright, location, and the creation date.
- The Show Metadata button is only available when debugging mode is active.
- The Bulk Optimizer will let you override the normal behavior of not re-compressing
  an already processed image.
- The Restore links will only be available if you have an active API key with image
  backups enabled or if you've converted an image and left the originals intact.
- Could not validate API key
- WordPress does, by default, exclude things like the wp-admin and URLs with query
  strings from speculative loading.
- Speculative Loading is also disabled for logged-in users.
errors:
- Could not validate API key
- 'invalid: indicates that the key is not valid (not found)'
- 'expired: subscription has expired'
- 'exceeded: indicates a valid key with no remaining image credits'
