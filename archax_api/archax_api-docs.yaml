  - A bearer token with investment permissions is required in the Authorization header

    command with a valid JWT token sent in the token field; successful authentication
    returns a user-login-success event, while invalid tokens return an error status.
  - Archax ACE API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Users authenticate via
    a Login endpoint by sending email and password in the request body, which returns
    a JWT token in the response under the "jwt" field. This token should then be used
    for subsequent API requests, typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer
    token.
  - Bearer token authentication is required to access this endpoint. The token must
    be included in the Authorization header and must have investment permissions.
