notes:
- In order to access restricted API requests, there must be a Session Token set.
- The API Token creation is available under your My Profile menu.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Real-time reporting - see your statistics at any time for an up-to-date assessment
  of your campaign performance.
- The 'tmax' (the maximum time in milliseconds that SSP allows for bids to be received
  to avoid timeout) is 300ms.
- Currency is not passed either at the requests with RTB Floor CPM 0, as the currency
  is set up at the account level.
- EXADS has implemented this framework to fully support TCF – approved Ad Serving
  clients and their Publishers.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended for account security.
- You can have both 2FA methods enabled in your account.
- Push Notifications work on HTTPS sites only.
- No adult and explicit content for banner creatives and text descriptions, but adult
  landing pages are acceptable.
- By default, the Responsive Display Ads feature is configured off on all Ad Servers.
- The Responsive Display Ads checkbox is enabled by default for Advertisers.
- By default, data is displayed using the New York time zone (EST or EDT).
- You can change the statistics time zone by clicking on your Statistics page and
  selecting the Hour tab.
- You cannot have more than 2500 active campaigns at any one time (including paused
  campaigns).
- 'If creating a Native Ad campaign, you will see two checkboxes: Only Native Zones
  with Title and Responsive Display Ad Zones.'
- Only available for Ad Servers where Responsive Display Ads are enabled.
- This feature is only available to users with SaaS features enabled on their account.
- If you are logged in as a normal user, you will not see the Managed option when
  creating a campaign.
- This feature is only available on request. Contact your account manager and they
  can enable it for you.
- Daily Limits feature starts at 0:00 in the New York time zone
- Frequency Capping applies for the whole campaign
- Postback URL must include &value={payout} if Dynamic value is selected.
- Ensure syndication.example.com is replaced with actual conversion domain.
- 'The Bidder needs a minimum amount of data to start working, therefore: For CPM
  and Smart CPM, at least 500 impressions are needed. For CPC campaigns, at least
  20 clicks are needed. If you have rules set with goals, for all the payment models
  the campaign needs at least 3 goals.'
- Only available for Desktop Fullpage Interstitial and Mobile Fullpage Interstitial
  Ad Format campaigns with iframe URL variation.
- The campaign will need to gather a good volume of conversions before it can start
  optimizing for its targets (CPA or ROAS) accordingly. Roughly 30 conversions should
  allow for the chosen Smart Bid Strategy to become effective.
- For Ad servers that have both Shift4 and SafeCharge enabled as payment methods,
  one method needs to be labeled as 'Alternative Card Payment'.
- Payment option UnionPay is restricted to Advertisers from China and with currency
  USD only.
- Crypto network exchange fees might apply.
- Paying with alternative crypto has no country restriction.
- Traffic source data reflects activity from two days prior.
- For RTB zones to appear in the marketplace, they must have a minimum of 1,000 queries.
- One account can have a maximum of 200 active sites. There is no maximum number of
  archived sites.
- Choosing the wrong option for site type may prevent you from receiving the correct
  advertising and could negatively impact the revenue potential.
- If the site type is set as Website, you will need to validate the ownership of the
  site in order to create ad zones.
- There is a limit (set per network) to how many active zones an account can have.
  There is no limit to the number of archived zones.
- It is recommended that you implement the ad zone code as provided by the system.
  Modifying the ad zone code can affect the functionality of the ad zone.
- 'Sub IDs should be a number between 1 and Int32: Do not use zeroes at the beginning
  of Sub IDs.'
- Only it’s possible to group by two dimensions so in case you want to add sub it
  is mandatory to remove one of the others, otherwise the response will generate an
  error.
- Using the tag (keyword) method takes priority over the URL keyword method.
- Currently, nothing else other than the URL/tag methods are taken into consideration
  for determining the category of advertising you will receive.
- The Desktop Fullpage Interstitial and Mobile Fullpage Interstitial ad formats can
  interact with your website through some HTML events.
- Capping enabled should be set to false in the ad snippet.
- Capping can be enabled or disabled through the snippet.
- Blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services
  we are able to offer.
- The ad zone will automatically adjust to 100% of the container that you put the
  tag into.
- Revenue generated by internal campaigns will not show in the Advertiser or Publisher
  Payments tabs.
- EXADS supports v3 and v4.3 of VAST Standard.
- EXADS currently supports one ad per VAST response since that is a common practice.
- The Wrapper Ad may include any number of Tracking URLs to allow campaigns to be
  served from an InLine response but tracked separately from the Impression.
- Open RTB standards version 2.4 is supported, however, the ADM is different from
  the standards.
- If the client supports XML, they need to provide EXADS with their RTB specifications.
- 'Throttle: This is a % of traffic you want to send daily. Recommendation: set up
  15-20 for a test and then you can increase gradually, the maximum being 100.'
- 'Automatic Throttle: we advise you to always have this turned on to save resources
  and costs of servers. Automatic Throttle will adjust queries automatically, which
  means if the exchange partner is not responding to queries at specific geos, the
  system will lower the throttle automatically.'
- HTTP is recommended due to extra latency when using HTTPS.
- Timeout for requests is 300ms.
- Only Push Notification and Native ad formats may bid with the CPC pricing model.
- This implementation supports both the regular OpenRTB 2.5 implementation and the
  Prebid Server implementation.
- The Prebid / OpenRTB 2.5 Bid Response will work with both Prebid and standard OpenRTB
  2.5.
- Ensure to enable RTB for the publisher account in Admin configuration.
- Only one of the objects {site, app} should be present in each request.
- To answer a bid request without making an actual bid, an HTTP response code 204
  'No Content' will be sent.
- To answer a bid request without making an actual bid, an HTTP response code 204
  "No Content" will be sent.
- When the parameter Bid Response Object -> Seat Bid Object -> Bid Object -> nurl
  is in the bid response, a GET request must be performed to such URL.
- Rate limiting is based on both username and ip address.
- The statistics API routes have been renamed.
- The Global Statistics API only shows skipped RTB queries for Date, Sites, Zones,
  Countries, Regions, and Sub IDs.
- Each request to user related content requires an Authorization header with the token
  type and Session token.
- Ad format used is mobile_instant_message.
- Very rarely, an ad zone request will return a correct response, but the 'data' field
  will be null. This means that the system found no ads to satisfy the given request
  given user locale, browser etc.
