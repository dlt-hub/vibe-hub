auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.opendota.com/:
  - You can use the API without a key, but registering for a key allows increased
    rate limits and usage. The API page at https://www.opendota.com/api-keys provides
    details on obtaining an API key. However, the specific mechanism for submitting
    the key (header name, query parameter, etc.) is not documented in this excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.opendota.com/:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer for number of matches) and offset
    (query parameter, integer for number of matches to skip). Response is an array;
    construct next request by incrementing offset by the limit value until no more
    results are returned.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of matches to return per request, and offset specifies the number of matches to
    skip, allowing you to retrieve subsequent pages by incrementing the offset value.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of matches to return, and offset specifies the number of matches to skip. Both
    are integers.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of matches to return, and offset specifies the number of matches to skip. Both
    are optional integers.
  - The GET /players/{account_id}/wl endpoint uses offset-based pagination with limit
    and offset query parameters to control pagination. The limit parameter specifies
    the number of matches to return per request, and the offset parameter specifies
    the starting position for results.
