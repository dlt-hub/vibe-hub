  - The Partner API Key must be included in the HTTP request header under the key
    `X-Partner-Code`. Additionally, requests require a Bearer token in the `authorization`
    header. The Partner API Key is obtained by contacting your Customer Success Manager
    for verification and generation, and users must also generate their own tokens
    within Userback.

  - API token authentication is required. Generate an API token from Workspace Settings
    > API Token section, then use it to authenticate API requests. The token should
    be sent as an authentication credential in your API calls over HTTPS.
