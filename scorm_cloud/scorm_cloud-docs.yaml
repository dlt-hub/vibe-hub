auth_info:
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/guides/youtube_video_import/:
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Send an Authorization header with the value
    "Basic " followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password". The example
    shows the format: Authorization: Basic RTRDWE5SQkZFMDpTZWNyZXRLZXlBYUJiQ2NEZEVlRmZHZ0hoSWlKaktrTGxNbU5uT28='
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/guides/permission_based_authorization/:
  - OAuth2 Bearer token authentication. Retrieve a token via OAuth2 client credentials
    flow, then pass it in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}". Tokens are
    scoped (e.g., read:ping) and expire after 300 seconds; requests with expired tokens
    will fail immediately.
  - OAuth2 application token authentication. Send a POST request to the GetAppToken
    endpoint with Basic Authentication (base64-encoded credentials in the Authorization
    header) and include desired scopes and expiration time in the request body. The
    response provides an access_token that must be included in subsequent API requests
    to access resources limited by the specified scopes.
  - Permission-based authorization in SCORM Cloud uses OAuth tokens for scoped, time-limited
    access. OAuth tokens are generated using an App ID and Secret Key pair, and can
    be used as an alternative to direct App ID/Secret Key authentication for requests
    that require fine-grained permissions and expiring credentials.
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/knowledge_base/authentication_types/:
  - 'SCORM Cloud supports two authentication methods: traditional App ID / Secret
    Key pairs for full API access, and OAuth tokens with scope-based restrictions.
    App ID / Secret Key pairs grant unrestricted create, read, update, and delete
    permissions. OAuth tokens limit access by scope (e.g., read, read:registration)
    and include an expiry time; scopes can be refined to specific services or actions.
    OAuth tokens are optional but provide enhanced security through credential limitation.
    Token revocation is not available, so set appropriate scopes and expiry times
    before generation.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/reference/api_overview/:
  - List endpoints return paginated results with a `more` key in the response. Use
    the `more` value as a parameter in the next request to fetch subsequent pages.
    Continue until no `more` token is returned, indicating the end of results.
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/api_reference/v1/dispatch/:
  - Use query parameter page (required, starts at 1) to request pages. Continue paginating
    by incrementing page until an empty list is returned in the response.
  - Use the query parameter page (starting at 1) to request pages of dispatch destinations.
    Continue paginating by incrementing page until an empty list is returned, indicating
    no more data.
- information_source; https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/reference/api_overview:
  - List results are paginated with a `more` key returned in each page. Use the `more`
    value as a parameter in the next request to fetch subsequent pages. Continue until
    no `more` key is returned, indicating the end of results.
