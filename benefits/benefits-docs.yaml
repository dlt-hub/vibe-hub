auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/va.gov/benefits/1.0.0/openapi.json:
  - API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in the HTTP
    header named 'apikey'. The token must be requested from the VA developer portal.
    Additionally, the sandbox environment supports a 'Status-Override' header on the
    /uploads/{id} endpoint for testing purposes to simulate different submission statuses.
  - No `apikey` authorization header is required for the PUT request to the location
    URL returned in Step 2, as authorization is embedded in the signed location URL.
    The initial request to obtain the location URL (Step 1) implicitly requires authentication,
    though the specific auth mechanism is not detailed in this excerpt.
  - Use API key authentication via the `apikey` query parameter. The API key must
    be provided for each request to authenticate access to the Benefits Intake API
    endpoints.
