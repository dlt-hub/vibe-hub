  - 'I need the actual endpoint definitions from the OpenAPI specification. The input
    you''ve provided only shows the metadata section (servers, info, etc.) but not
    the paths section where endpoints are defined.


    Please provide the `paths` section of the OpenAPI specification, which contains
    the actual endpoint definitions with HTTP methods and paths.


    If you intended to provide the complete specification but it was cut off, please
    share the full document including the `paths` section.'
