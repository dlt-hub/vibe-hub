notes:
- Tokens are valid for 60 minutes.
- Ensure to request only the necessary scopes.
- All expert requests are processed asynchronously.
- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with Bearer token.
- Overall authentication cannot succeed even if a second biometric is successfully
  matched and judged to be live.
- Tokens are valid for 60 minutes and should be refreshed proactively.
- Each expert processing request is for the evaluation of a single document.
- Canned response service is only available in sandbox environments.
- Uses OAuth2 with Bearer token for authorization
- Responses may vary based on document verification results
- A watchlist can be created with some of those fields depend on the watchlist type.
