- information_source; https://developer.boc-group.com/adoxx/en/API-Guide/:
  - 'The API supports four authentication methods: Token Based Authentication using
    a hashed security token for technical users; Basic Authentication using an Authorization
    header with base64-encoded username:password for standard users; OAuth 2.0 with
    Authorization Code flow for standard users or Client Credentials flow for technical
    users, both using access tokens; and JWT authentication using tokens from an external
    identity provider for standard users with optional claims-based user properties.'
- information_source; https://developer.boc-group.com/adoxx/en/28.1/API-Guide/:
  - 'ADOXX RESTful services support four authentication mechanisms: Token Based Authentication
    using hashed security tokens in requests executed as technical users, Basic Authentication
    via Authorization header with base64-encoded username:password, OAuth 2.0 with
    Authorization Code flow for standard users or Client Credentials flow for technical
    users, and JWT authentication using tokens from external identity providers for
    standard users. Each mechanism sends credentials differently: tokens and OAuth
    access tokens accompany requests, basic auth uses the Authorization header with
    base64-encoded credentials, and JWTs are acquired from an external IdP and included
    in requests.'
- information_source; https://developer.boc-group.com/adoxx/en/SCIM/:
  - 'BOC SCIM API supports four authentication mechanisms: Token Based Authentication
    (hashed security token sent with each request for a technical user context), Basic
    Authentication (Authorization header with base64-encoded username:password for
    any standard user), OAuth 2.0 with Authorization Code flow (access token for any
    standard user) or Client Credentials flow (access token for a technical user),
    and JWT authentication (external identity provider for user authentication). Specific
    header names, parameter names, and implementation details are documented in linked
    authentication pages.'
  - JWT authentication is used, where a JSON Web Token acquired from an external identity
    provider (IdP) is sent with requests for authentication. The token may optionally
    contain user properties via claims and requests execute in the context of standard
    product users.
- information_source; https://developer.boc-group.com/adoxx/en/28.0/API-Guide/:
  - 'The API supports three authentication methods: Token Based Authentication using
    a hashed security token for technical users, Basic Authentication via an "Authorization"
    header containing base64-encoded username:password for standard users, and OAuth
    2.0 using an access token for standard users.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.boc-group.com/adoxx/en/release-notes/:
  - Paging is now enforced on the search endpoint with page sizes not exceeding 1000
    elements. The `include` URL parameter specifies additional data in responses.
    No explicit pagination parameters or response fields for navigating pages are
    documented.
