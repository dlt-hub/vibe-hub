  - 'Access tokens are retrieved through an OAuth2 authorization flow and then sent
    in API requests via the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. Include
    the token as "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" in request headers. Error responses
    use standard OAuth2 error codes like invalid_request, invalid_client, unauthorized_client,
    and unsupported_grant_type returned in JSON format.'
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is required. POST to https://cloud.cambiumnetworks.com/api/v2/access/token
    with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret in the request
    body to obtain an access_token. Use the returned access_token as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header when accessing API resources at the redirect_uri provided
    in the token response.
  - 'The API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. Send a POST request to https://{server_url}/api/v2/access/token
    with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret as form-urlencoded
    parameters to obtain an access_token. Use the returned access_token as a bearer
    token in the Authorization header (format: "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN")
    for subsequent API requests. The token expires after the seconds specified in
    expires_in.'
  - cnMaestro API uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. Retrieve an access token
    by sending a POST request to /api/v2/access/token with grant_type=client_credentials,
    authenticating via either an Authorization header with Basic auth (base64-encoded
    client_id:client_secret) or by passing client_id and client_secret in the request
    body. Use the returned access_token in subsequent API requests.
