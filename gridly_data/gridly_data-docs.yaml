    method: "GET"
    params:
      - name: "grid_id"
        required: true
        description: "The ID of the grid to manage records for."
    data_selector: "$.data.records"  # Assuming the response has records under this path

  - name: "grids"
    endpoint: "/api/grids"
    method: "GET"
    params:
