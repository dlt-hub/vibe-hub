notes:
- Access tokens are short lived and typically last one hour.
- It is recommended to renew the access tokens before they expire.
- You need a Sinch MMS Account in order to integrate with MMS channel
- Messages sent by your contacts will only arrive on MMS channel if they were recognized
  as MMS on the sender device
- Sinch SDKs offer a consistent standardized framework for functionality to address
  problems like pagination, error code response and language familiarity regardless
  of the underlying API setup.
- Sinch SMS API supports MMS messages under some circumstances
- Learn about how the Voice API authenticates.
- Most endpoints will request your service_plan_id, API token, and Sinch phone number.
- Start sending SMS through a single connection for timely and cost efficient communications.
- If your solution is based in the US region, you may also be able to use the SMS
  REST API to send mobile terminated MMS messages.
- While these tutorials provide more real-world context and supporting material than
  some of our other guides, they are still intended for demonstrative purposes. In
  a production environment, you will have to modify any provided code samples to ensure
  that you maintain the security, efficacy, and stability of your solutions.
- HMAC authentication configuration at the service plan level is supported.
- Response and scope values in OAuth 2.0 callback validation are supported.
- When you are done testing, you can purchase additional virtual numbers from the
  Sinch Build Dashboard.
- Most of our endpoints will request your service_plan_id, API token, and Sinch phone
  number.
- Ensure you set your region in the SMS_REGION field.
- Requires access key credentials from your Sinch Build Dashboard.
- For testing purposes on your local environment it's fine to use hardcoded values,
  but before deploying to production we strongly recommend using environment variables
  to store the credentials.
- Requires setup of access keys in the Sinch Build Dashboard
- Double check that the region is correct on your base URL.
- This functionality is currently only available for selected accounts but will become
  more broadly available in the future.
- The bearer token is valid for one hour.
- You can have a maximum of 10 keys per project.
- Access Keys are used to access Sinch Product APIs and can be managed within the
  Sinch Build Dashboard.
- The access token is meant to be short lived for enhanced security. Generate one
  as often as it is necessary.
- Basic authentication is intended for test purposes only, and should only be used
  for experimenting with APIs and building prototypes.
- The access token is meant to be short lived for enhanced security.
- Basic authentication is intended for test purposes only.
- Access tokens are short lived, typically lasting one hour.
- It is recommended to renew access tokens before they expire.
