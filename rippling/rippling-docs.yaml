auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.rippling.com/documentation/rest-api:
  - 'API tokens are used for authorization, passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header. Tokens are generated in the API Tokens app, expire after 30 days of inactivity,
    and inherit the permissions of the token owner. Include the token as Authorization:
    Bearer <token> in request headers.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required, sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}". Access to specific API operations, resources, and fields is controlled
    by entitlements (API Tier I or API Tier II) issued separately by Rippling, independent
    of basic authorization; fields without sufficient entitlements appear redacted
    in the __meta envelope of responses.
  - Use Bearer token authentication by including the Authorization header with the
    value "Bearer {token}" in all requests. Optionally specify API version using the
    Rippling-Api-Version header in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- information_source; https://developer.rippling.com/documentation/rest-api/essentials/api-tokens:
  - 'API tokens are created with a unique identifier and assigned scopes based on
    the creator''s permissions. The token''s authorization scope determines what data
    endpoints return: users with limited permissions (e.g., managers) will only see
    filtered results matching their scope, while Super Admins see all company data.
    Scopes can include custom objects and record types based on the creator''s custom
    object permissions.'
- information_source; https://developer.rippling.com/documentation/rest-api/essentials/query-parameters:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}", where {token} is your API access token (e.g., "Bearer
    UOCgmwb..."). The exact header name is Authorization and the scheme is Bearer.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.rippling.com/documentation/rest-api:
  - List endpoints use forward pagination with a `limit` query parameter (default
    50, max 100 per endpoint; returns 400 if exceeded) and `cursor` query parameter
    for subsequent requests. The `next_link` response field provides the next page
    URL; it is null on the last page.
  - The API accepts cursor and limit based pagination. The limit parameter specifies
    maximum page size as an integer in request parameters. List endpoints support
    forward pagination only. Use the cursor value from the response to request the
    next page.
