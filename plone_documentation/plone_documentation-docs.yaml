auth_info:
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/index.html:
  - 'Plone REST API uses HTTP Basic Authentication for requests. Credentials are passed
    via the --user flag in curl (format: username:password) or as an Authorization
    header with base64-encoded credentials. A basic authorization token must be obtained
    before making authenticated requests to the API.'
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/introduction.html:
  - 'Basic authentication is used for API access. Include an Authorization header
    with the value "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
    For example, use Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0 where the encoded part
    represents admin:secret credentials.'
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/usage/authentication.html:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required, passed in the Authorization header as
    "Bearer <JWT_token>". Additionally, users must have the "plone.restapi: Use REST
    API" permission, and specific Plone permissions (View, Add portal, etc.) depending
    on the operation.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header using the Bearer scheme: Authorization: Bearer <token>. The token is a
    JWT that must be obtained prior to making requests.'
  - Bearer token authentication using JWT. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {token}". Tokens expire after 12 hours and must
    be renewed by POSTing to the @login-renew endpoint with the current token in the
    Authorization header.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/usage/batching.html:
  - Pagination uses hypermedia links in the response. Query parameters `b_size` (batch
    size, default 25) and `b_start` (first item offset) control pagination. Response
    includes `@id`, `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links to navigate pages; use
    these links or construct new requests with updated `b_start` values to move through
    batches.
  - Pagination uses query parameters b_size (batch size) and b_start (start offset)
    to request pages. Responses include a batching object with @id, first, last, prev,
    and next links for navigation, plus items_total for total count. The batching
    object is omitted if results fit in a single page.
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/endpoints/groups.html:
  - The endpoint supports a limit parameter with a default maximum of 25 groups at
    a time. The query parameter filters groups where groupname starts with the provided
    value. No explicit pagination mechanism such as page numbers, cursors, or next/previous
    links is described.
- information_source; https://6.docs.plone.org/plone.restapi/docs/source/endpoints/registry.html:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with the b_start query parameter. The response
    includes a batching object with first, last, and next URLs containing b_start
    values to navigate pages, with a default page size of 25 items.
  - The registry records listing uses batching to access all records. See the Batching
    documentation for details on pagination parameters and response fields used to
    navigate through batched results.
