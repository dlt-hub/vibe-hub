auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.axonius.com/docs/ivanti-service-manager:
  - Ivanti Service Manager uses API Key authentication. The API Key is required and
    must be created from the Ivanti Service Manager configuration console. The key
    is used to authorize REST API endpoints. The domain parameter specifies the hostname
    of the Ivanti Service Manager server, and an optional URL Base Prefix can be appended
    to the domain.
- information_source; https://docs.axonius.com/docs/manage-service-now-asset-with-api:
  - Use stored credentials from a configured ServiceNow adapter connection, or provide
    credentials directly. Direct credential options include basic auth with username
    and password, or OAuth 2.0 with Client ID and Client Secret. The ServiceNow domain
    URL is also required when not using stored adapter credentials.
- information_source; https://docs.axonius.com/docs/manageengine-desktop-central:
  - OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret, and OAuth Refresh Token are required for
    Cloud instances. For on-premises deployments, use Username and Password authentication.
    OAuth credentials are generated through the Zoho API Console and used to authenticate
    requests to the ManageEngine Desktop Central REST API.
  - User Name and Password authentication is required. Provide username and password
    credentials for a user account with permissions to fetch assets. Optionally, OAuth
    authentication is supported using OAuth Client ID, OAuth Client Secret, and OAuth
    Refresh Token parameters.
  - 'Zoho uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. To authenticate, you need to generate
    an authorization code via the Zoho API Console, then exchange it for tokens using
    client_id, client_secret, and the authorization code. The refresh_token from the
    token response should be stored and used for subsequent API requests.


    Key details: Authorization code is obtained from Zoho API Console with specified
    scopes (e.g., DesktopCentralCloud.Common.READ, DesktopCentralCloud.SOM.READ, etc.
    for Desktop/Endpoint Central; PatchManagerPlusCloud.Common.READ, PatchManagerPlusCloud.PatchMgmt.READ,
    etc. for Patch Manager Plus). Token endpoint is https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token
    with grant_type=authorization_code, redirect_uri=http://localhost/callback, code
    (the generated code), client_id, and client_secret as POST parameters. The refresh_token
    from the response is used for ongoing authentication.'
