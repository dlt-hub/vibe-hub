auth_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.intershop.com/kb/U29770:
  - 'Bearer token, basic authentication, or custom auth token can be used. Send credentials
    via the Authorization header using one of these schemes: "Bearer <token>" for
    bearerAuth, standard HTTP basic auth for basicAuth, or a custom token format for
    authToken.'
  - Identity JSON web tokens are used for authentication. The token must be provided
    in the request (exact header/parameter location not specified in this excerpt)
    and contains user claims that are decoded to create or update user profiles. A
    missing, empty, or invalid token returns a 401 Unauthorized response. The token's
    content determines whether a user account is created, updated, or rejected based
    on organization-level self-administration policies (intershop.authentication..selfAdministrationPolicy
    configuration property).
  - 'Several authentication methods are supported: Bearer tokens via Authorization
    header with "Bearer {token}" format, alternative authentication-token header,
    or basic authentication. Tokens are obtained from a token endpoint supporting
    password grant, refresh token grant, client authentication via basic auth, or
    anonymous access, with responses containing ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh
    tokens for subsequent requests.'
  - The API accepts identity JSON web tokens passed either as a bearer token in the
    Authorization header or as an id_token property in the JSON request body. The
    token claims are used to create or update user profiles, with the sub claim and
    token issuer serving as the mapping key for identifying users.
  - 'The API supports three authentication schemes: Bearer token authentication via
    the Authorization header with Bearer scheme, HTTP Basic authentication using base64-encoded
    username:password credentials, and a custom authToken scheme. All three are acceptable
    for the credentials and security question endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.intershop.com/kb/index.php/Display/2Q8725:
  - The /products endpoint uses a query parameter "amount" to control the number of
    products returned per request, with a default limit of 200 items. If more products
    are needed, the limit can be increased through configuration, though implementing
    pagination is recommended for better performance.
