notes:
- Plyvel 1.x depends on LevelDB >= 1.20, which at the time of writing (early 2018)
  is more recent than the versions packaged by various Linux distributions.
- The easiest solution is to use the pre-built binary packages.
- This document assumes basic familiarity with LevelDB.
- Long-lived snapshots may consume significant resources in your LevelDB database
- Custom comparators written in Python come with a considerable performance impact
- For real-world applications, you probably want to tweak things like the size of
  the memory cache and the number of bits to use for the (optional) bloom filter.
