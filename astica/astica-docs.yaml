notes:
- Each API is limited to 45 requests per minute allowing a total of 90 requests per
  minute when using both Vision and Voice.
- Model Training and Custom Model API both have an increased default limit of 90 requests
  per minute.
- Receive instant access today with automatic quota refresh every 7 days.
- Quota consumption prioritized over account compute balance for API + Web UI.
- asticaVision is available for researcher preview. API pricing is subject to change.
- Custom model training is available for researcher preview. Pricing is subject to
  change.
- asticaVision is available for researcher preview and early access.
- Cost of active subscriptions will not be modified in the event of an increase.
- Access to upgrades are based on limited availability during preview.
- Uses coupon code 'evaluate' for discounts
