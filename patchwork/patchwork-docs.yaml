auth_info:
- information_source; https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rest/:
  - 'Patchwork API supports two authentication methods: basic authentication using
    username and password, or token authentication which is recommended. Token authentication
    requires passing credentials in the request, likely via an Authorization header
    or query parameter, though specific header/parameter names and token format are
    not detailed in this excerpt.'
  - 'Patchwork supports two authentication methods: token authentication (recommended)
    and basic authentication. For token authentication, include the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Token ${token}" where the token is obtained
    from your user profile. For basic authentication, use the standard curl -u flag
    with your username and password. Some resources do not require authentication
    and will return 404 if credentials are not provided.'

  - 'Patchwork API supports two authentication methods: basic authentication using
    username and password, or token authentication which is recommended. For token
    authentication, obtain a token from your user profile, then include it in the
    Authorization header as a bearer token with each request.'
  - Token-based authentication via Authorization header with "Token" scheme, or basic
    auth using username and password. Send the token in the Authorization header as
    "Token ${token}", or use curl's -u flag with username:password for basic auth.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rest/:
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel values (next, last, first, prev) containing
    full URLs with page and per_page query parameters. Construct subsequent requests
    by following the appropriate Link header URL based on the desired relation.
  - Requests returning multiple items are paginated by 30 items by default. Use the
    query parameter page to navigate pages and per_page to set custom page sizes up
    to 100. The Link header with rel="next" and rel="prev" provides URLs for navigation.
- information_source; https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rest/schemas/v1.2/:
  - Pagination uses Link header with RFC 5988 format containing rel="next", rel="prev",
    rel="first", and rel="last" relations. Request parameters are page (integer, page
    number) and per_page (integer, results per page), both optional query parameters.
  - Pagination uses Link headers with relation types next, prev, first, and last pointing
    to subsequent, previous, first, and last pages respectively, following RFC 5988.
  - Pagination uses Link response headers following RFC 5988, with rel="next", rel="prev",
    rel="first", and rel="last" to navigate between pages of results.
