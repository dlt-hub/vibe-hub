notes:
- The query token is valid for around 2 hours so it should be reobtained when it expires.
- The API is limited to 30 requests per IP address per minute.
- The Dimensions Analytics API is subscription-only, so your Dimensions account needs
  to be activated for this service and subject to restrictions on use.
- Concepts regularly get updated both as a result of constantly growing data in Dimensions,
  and because our concepts extraction AI tools improve.
- When performing batch extractions of large amounts of data using the API, you should
  monitor the warning messages being returned, so to be able to deal with unusually
  large records separately.
- The Dimensions Analytics API is subscription-only, so your Dimensions account needs
  to be activated for this service.
- The purpose of the API is to help support complex analytical tasks that could not
  otherwise be achieved through use of the Dimensions platform.
- It is not intended to be used to create local copies of the Dimensions data for
  use as an alternative to the API, which should remain as the primary source of the
  data.
