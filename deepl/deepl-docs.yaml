notes:
- The total request body size for text translation requests must not exceed 128 KiB.
- If you are on a free API account, you can replace https://api.deepl.com with https://api-free.deepl.com.
- Keep your API key secure at all times. Do not use it in client-side code.
- The API endpoint is different for the Free API and Pro API.
- Pro API subscribers can create up to 25 simultaneously active API keys. Free API
  subscribers can create up to 2 simultaneously active API keys.
- Deactivating a key is permanent.
- If you receive 429 or 500 errors, use retries with exponential backoff.
- Especially for use cases with low latency requirements, we recommend using a persistent
  HTTP connection.
- Please do not make API requests using query parameters.
- It’s not possible to send requests to the DeepL API from the browser.
- DeepL considers the broader context of a source text or document when translating.
- Storing API responses lets apps serve content faster and avoids extra costs from
  repeated requests for unchanged content.
- If you realize your API authentication key has been compromised, log in to your
  DeepL account immediately.
- You can also generate new keys from the same page.
- To process XML input, set the tag_handling parameter to xml.
- When enabling tag_handling by setting it to xml, the DeepL API is able to process
  structured XML content.
- For XML structured content in classic models, we set the parameter split_sentences
  to nonewlines to make sure that newlines do not alter the results.
- Automatic detection of the XML structure can be disabled for better results.
- The translation engine does not take HTML tags into account by default.
- Released an official DeepL API OpenAPI spec
- Released an official client libraries for multiple programming languages
- In the future, we plan to extend the language information returned by the API.
- Character count is limited to 500,000 characters per month for DeepL API Free.
- API key required for access
- Out-of-the-box retries with exponential backoff for correct handling of 429 and
  500 errors
- Persistent HTTP connection (keep-alive) enabled by default
- DeepL API requires an API key for authentication.
- Uses API key for authentication
- The uploaded document is automatically removed from the server once the translated
  document has been downloaded.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your API key.'
- '429 Too Many Requests: Throttle your requests.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or token expiration'
- Header size limit of 16 KiB for all requests
- '456 Quota exceeded: The API will respond with this error when 100% of a key-level
  limit has been reached.'
- '429: Too Many Requests'
- '500: Internal Server Error'
- 'HTTP 429: too many requests. This is an error that you might receive when sending
  many API requests in a short period of time. Your application should be configured
  to resend the requests after some delay. Specifically, we recommend implementing
  retries with exponential backoff.'
- 'HTTP 456: quota exceeded. If you’re a Free API user, you’ll receive this error
  when the monthly 500,000 character limit of your subscription has been reached.
  You can consider upgrading your subscription if you need more character volume.
  If you’re a Pro API user, you’ll receive this error when your Cost Control limit
  has been reached, and you can increase or remove your Cost Control limit if you
  need to continue translating.'
- 'HTTP 500: internal server error. This is an error you’ll receive if there are temporary
  errors in DeepL Services. Your application should be configured to resend the requests
  after some delay. Specifically, we recommend implementing retries with exponential
  backoff.'
