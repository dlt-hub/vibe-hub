- The access token has a time to live of 10 hours.
- You can authenticate a maximum of 10 times within a 5-minute window.
- API allows up to 500 requests per day for deal updates and 15 requests per day for
  deal creations.
- Access token has a time to live of 10 hours.
- User token also has a time to live of 10 hours.
- When you log into the Maestro platform, a blank page might mean that you have an
  ad blocker turned on blocking smartadserver.com.
- If you see a 'Could not authenticate' message, it probably means you have saved
  the login page to your browser bookmarks.
- If you see a 400 bad request error, try clearing your cookies.
- Ensure you aren't trying to connect using the 'Terms and Conditions' URL when unable
  to click 'Accept'.
- A network issue may indicate a problem with the network or an active ad blocker.
- To log in, go to https://buyerconnect.smartadserver.com/media-planning and enter
  the email address associated with your account and your password.
- Click Log in with Google if you have a private or corporate Google account.
- When updating a deal using the PUT method, you must include all relevant fields
  in the request body.
- Profiles without any update for over 14 days are deleted automatically.
- Alternatively, click Log in with Google if you have a private or corporate Google
  account.
- To log in, go to Maestro and enter the email address associated with your account
  and your password.
- The sandbox runs on a development database. Equativ may erase sandbox data once
  integration tests are completed.
- HTML5 creatives can be served into interstitial and banner ad formats.
- 'User management is based on three core elements: companies, users, and user roles.'
- Sandbox runs on a development database. Equativ may erase sandbox data once integration

- Access to the activation solution isn't granted by default and must be requested
  for activation.
- If users encounter issues while trying to access the platform, refer to the following
  table of common problems and their recommended solutions.
- Supports targeting specific publishers, domains, and apps.
- A site list currently used in an active deal cannot be deactivated.
- Deleting a site list is permanent; it cannot be restored.
- The Activation module is an end-to-end buying solution that extends the capabilities
  of Maestro.
- Semantic segments are sets of categories based on page-level semantic meaning of
  the web content.
- Equativ uses its in-house cutting edge solution based on artificial intelligence
  and deep learning technology.
- All sensitive categories are disabled by default.
- There is a limit of 5,000 domains per import file.
- If you target a domain, all its sub-domains are automatically targeted.
- Domain category targeting relies on Equativ’s in-house proprietary categorization
  of domains and apps into segments.
