notes:
- dim_shape replaces arg_shape
- argshift replaces asloss
- No flattening required in v2
- Pyxu provides a modular architecture for image reconstruction.
- Bayesian inversion allows for uncertainty management in image reconstruction.
- Uses implicit priors in Plug-and-Play schemes.
- The resulting image looks 'sketchy' and extremely quantized. Lots of details are
  lost w.r.t the MAP solution.
- 'The tightest Lipschitz constant is given by the spectral norm of the operator A:
  ‖A‖2. It can be computed via the SVD, which is compute-intensive task for large
  operators.'
- In this setting, it may be advantageous to overestimate the Lipschitz constant with
  the Frobenius norm of A since ‖A‖F≥‖A‖2.
- ‖A‖F can be efficiently approximated by computing the trace of A∗A (or AA∗) via
  the Hutch++ stochastic algorithm.
- ‖A‖F is upper-bounded by ‖A‖F≤n‖A‖2, where the equality is reached (worst-case scenario)
  when the eigenspectrum of the linear operator is flat.
- Partial device<>CPU synchronization takes place when stopping-criteria are evaluated.
  Increasing stop_rate is advised to reduce the effect of such transfers when applicable.
- Full device<>CPU synchronization takes place at checkpoint-time. Increasing writeback_rate
  is advised to reduce the effect of such transfers when applicable.
- Use when a quantity was auto-inferenced with possible caveats.
- Use for performance-related warnings.
- Issue a warning for DASK-related performance issues.
- Use for precision-related warnings.
- Use for sparse-based algos which revert to dense arrays.
- Inform test suite runner of (safe) non-transparent function call.
- Inform user of a backend-specific problem to be aware of.
- Use for warnings related to Pyxu plugins.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Only float32/64 kernels are supported.
- Index regions in output where the stencil is not fully supported are set to 0.
- This operator performs a convolution between the input D-dimensional NDArray and
  a uniform D-dimensional filter.
- The implementation is based on second derivatives approximated via finite differences.
- The Structure Tensor is a matrix derived from the gradient of a function.
- In case of using the finite differences (diff_type="fd"), the finite difference
  scheme defaults to central.
- The operator stacks the first-order partial derivatives of a D-dimensional signal.
- Gaussian derivatives compute exact derivatives in the continuous domain.
- The Jacobian operator computes first-order partial derivatives.
- The Divergence operator computes the expansion or outgoingness of a D-dimensional
  vector-valued signal.
- The Hessian operator computes the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives.
- Sum of the second directional derivatives of a multi-dimensional array (at least
  two dimensions are required) along multiple directions for each entry of the array.
- This implementation is matrix-free by leveraging properties of the Kronecker product,
  i.e. A and B need not be known explicitly.
- This implementation is matrix-free by leveraging properties of the Khatri-Rao product,
  i.e. A and B need not be known explicitly.
- 'Let f:RM1×⋯×MD→RN1×⋯×NK be a differentiable multi-dimensional map. The *Jacobian*
  (or *differential*) of f at z∈RM1×⋯×MD is defined as the best linear approximator
  of f near z, in the following sense: f(x)−f(z)=Jf(z)(x−z)+o(‖x−z‖)asx→z.'
- 'The Jacobian admits the following matrix representation: [Jf(x)]ij:=∂fi∂xj(x),∀(i,j)∈{1,…,N1⋯NK}×{1,…,M1⋯MD}.'
- Operators created with this wrapper do not support Dask inputs for now.
- The convergence is guaranteed for step sizes α≤2/β.
- The default stopping criterion is the relative norm change of the primal variable.
- The problem is feasible – i.e. there exists at least one solution.
- The algorithm has convergence guarantees for the case in which H is composed with
  a linear operator K.
- Automatic selection of parameters is not supported for non-linear differentiable
  maps K.
- If you want to add a grace period to a solver, i.e. for it to do *at least* N iterations
  before stopping based on the value of another criteria, you can AND MaxIter with
  the other criteria.
