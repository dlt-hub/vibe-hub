notes:
- CatBoost supports various parameters for model training and data processing.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Allow to write analytical and snapshot files during training. Enabled by default.
- Use all the preceding rows in the fold for calculating the approximated values.
  This mode is slower and in rare cases slightly more accurate.
- This parameter can be used if the selected bootstrap type is Bayesian. Possible
  values are in the range [0, +inf). The higher the value the more aggressive the
  bagging is.Default value in 1.0.
- The minimal number of trees that the best model should have. If set, the output
  model contains at least the given number of trees even if the best model is located
  within these trees. Should be used with the useBestModel parameter. No limit by
  default.
- The number of splits for numerical features. Allowed values are integers from 1
  to 65535 inclusively. Default value is 254.
- Timeout to wait while establishing socket connections between TrainingDriver and
  workers.Default is 1 minute.
- Default value for depth is 6.
- Default value for diffusion temperature is 10000.
- Default value for iterations is 1000.
- Default value for L2 regularization term is 3.0.
- Default value for fold length multiplier is 2.0.
- Default value for fold permutation block is 1.
- Default learning rate is 0.03 if not set explicitly.
- Default logging level is 'Verbose'.
- Default metric period is 1.
- Default model shrink mode is 'Constant'.
- Default nan mode is 'Min'.
- Default value for odWait is 20.
- Default penalties coefficient is 1.0.
- Default random seed is 0.
- Default random strength is 1.0.
- Default value for randomStrength is 1.0
- Default value for rsm is 1
- Default value for samplingFrequency is 'PerTreeLevel'
- Default value for samplingUnit is 'Object'
- Default value for saveSnapshot period is 600 seconds
- Default value for scoreFunction is 'Cosine'
- Default value for trainDir is 'catboost_info'
- Default value for workerInitializationTimeout is 10 minutes
- Default value for workerMaxFailures is 4
