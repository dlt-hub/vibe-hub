notes:
- Basic authentication typically uses a base64 encoded username:password pair, but
  since we only require an API key we instead structure the payload as [yourApiKey]:[empty].
- 'Circuit API will reject requests without the Content-type: application/json header.'
- Add support for custom stop properties to manage additional metadata on stops.
- Add support for creating, editing, deleting, and importing drivers.
- A stop is a location that a driver will visit. A stop will always be associated
  with a plan, and can be associated with a route.
- An unassigned stop is a location that a driver will visit.
- The only way to assign a stop to a plan currently is to use the web UI.
- Do not include the <> signs in the api key
- Operation may take a long time to finish, process it asynchronously.
- Remember to add a delay between each check to avoid rate limits.
- The optimization can take a long while to finish, so it is processed asynchronously.
- Remember to add a delay between each check to avoid rate-limiting.
- Rate limit may apply when checking operation status.
- Use caution when rate-limiting to avoid throttling.
- All changes will be applied at once when using reoptimize and save.
- The optimization can take a long while to finish, process asynchronously.
- All changes will be applied at once after using reoptimize and redistribute/save.
- Email or phone number is the minimum information needed to create a driver.
