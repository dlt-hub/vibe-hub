- 'Address entry - postal codes: Several countries supported by YubiEnterprise Delivery
  do not use postal codes (for example Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates). However,

- 'Auto-filling address: Currently this guide assumes that the user will be shipping
  their key to the address listed in ServiceNow. The catalog item may need to be extended
  to allow the user to input their personal address (for example, if they are not
  located at one of your main offices). You may want to consider leveraging the YubiEnterprise
  Delivery Verify Address API to allow your users to correct any address errors prior
  to submitting a shipment request.'
- The old endpoints for user management are deprecated and will be available until
  November 23, 2024.
- 'Channel Partners: To order keys via API from inventory purchased through channel
  partners, the new /shipments_exact APIs must be used. The older, deprecated /shipments
  API only supports ordering keys from inventory purchased directly from Yubico.'
- 'India shipments: Some of our shipments to India use India Post for the last mile.
  India Post does not support our automated shipment tracking service, and therefore
  the tracking ID that YubiEnterprise Delivery displays is not actually a link. Workaround:
  Copy the India Post tracking number (typically 13 digits starting with E, R, or
  C) and paste it into either the India Post website - https://www.indiapost.gov.in/_layouts/15/dop.portal.tracking/trackconsignment.aspx
  or any of the other tracking service sites that support India Post, such as Ship24.com
  - (https://www.ship24.com/couriers/india-post-tracking).'
- Google Workspace cannot support both the Service Provider-initiated ACS URL and
  the Identity Provider-initated ACS URL at the same time. Neither is it possible
  to set up two different SAML Apps in the same Google Workspace, because Google Workspace
  enforces SP EntityID uniqueness across all SAML Apps in the workspace.

- If you need to contact Customer Support, use the dedicated support form for YubiEnterprise
  Delivery.
- Although Console users can specify the inventory they want to draw from, this option
  is not available when using the CSV file with the API or when creating bulk shipments.
  These latter two methods only permit specifying the kind of stock (initial, replacement,
  buffer). When inventory is not specified or cannot be specified, the system uses
  the “first in, first out” rule, which means it will deduct from the oldest PO first.
- 'The CSV bulk upload does not support combining subscription and non-subscription
  products in a single shipment. Workaround: Use the API or the Console (from the
  Dashboard or the Shipments tab, Create shipment request > Single shipment) to create
  single shipment request that includes both types of products.'
- When getting a purchase order by its ID, extra, undocumented fields are returned.
  When a request for GET /v1/purchaseorders/{purchaseorderId} is sent, the response
  includes (is_vat_valid, is_tax_exempt, is_post_pay).
- To order keys via API from inventory purchased through channel partners, the new
