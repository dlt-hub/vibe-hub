auth_info:

  - Authentication tokens are required for each API method call. The first argument
    to all method calls is an authToken parameter, which by default is the built-in
    admin user's password set during initial configuration. Alternatively, a custom
    web services authentication token can be configured via the auth.webservices.auth-token
    setting in the Config editor. Additionally, IP address level security restricts
    API access to approved systems, with only localhost (127.0.0.1) allowed by default;
    additional IP addresses must be added under Options > Advanced > Allowed XML Web
    Services callers.
