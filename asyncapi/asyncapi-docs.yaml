  - 'To connect to WebSockets Private endpoints, you must first obtain an authentication
    token via the REST API endpoint "GetWebSocketsToken". This token is then provided
    in the "token" field of the subscription request message when subscribing to private
    channels on the ws-auth.kraken.com WebSocket server. The token should be included
    in the JSON subscription payload with the structure: {"event": "subscribe", "subscription":
    {"name": "<channel_name>", "token": "<your_token_here>"}}.'

  - 'OAuth2 authentication with four supported flows: implicit, password, clientCredentials,
    and authorizationCode. Each flow requires an authorizationUrl and tokenUrl, with
    optional refreshUrl for token refresh, and availableScopes as a map of scope names
    to descriptions.'
  - 'OAuth2 flow with authorization code grant. Clients obtain tokens via authorizationUrl
    (https://example.com/api/oauth/dialog) and tokenUrl (https://example.com/api/oauth/token),
    with available scopes: write:pets (modify pets in your account) and read:pets
    (read your pets).'
