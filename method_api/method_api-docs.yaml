pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.method.me/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters skip (integer, default not specified) to offset
    results and top (integer, default not specified) to limit results per request.
    Continue paginating by incrementing skip by the top value until fewer results
    than top are returned.
  - Pagination uses skip and top query parameters. The skip parameter specifies the
    number of records to skip (default 0), and the top parameter specifies the maximum
    number of records to return per request (default appears to be 10). To get subsequent
    pages, increment skip by the top value used in the previous request.
