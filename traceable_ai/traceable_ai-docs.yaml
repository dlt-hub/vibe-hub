auth_info:
- information_source; https://traceabledocs.document360.io/docs/download-api-spec:
  - Requires Traceable Platform API key for authorization. The API uses GraphQL endpoint
    at https://<traceable_public_api_url>/graphql and requires Account owner or Security
    role. Authorization details and exact header/parameter names for passing the API
    key are not fully specified in this excerpt.
  - Requires Traceable Platform authentication. Access the API using the downloadUrl
    provided in Step 2 responses, which handles authentication via browser redirect
    to the Traceable login page. Alternatively, use the /rest/download endpoint with
    appropriate credentials. Allowed roles are Account owner and Security roles as
    specified in authorization requirements.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication passed via the Authorization header.
    Include the header ''Authorization: <Platform_API_Token>'' in your GET request
    to the download endpoint, where Platform_API_Token is your API token string.'
  - "You must provide one of the following credentials to use the API: Domain ID,\
    \ Service ID, Label Name(s), or Environment Name. These credentials are retrieved\
    \ from the Traceable Platform (Catalog \u2192 Inventory section) and are used\
    \ as identifiers to specify which API specification to generate, but the documentation\
    \ does not specify how these credentials are passed in requests (headers, query\
    \ parameters, request body, etc.)."
- information_source; https://traceabledocs.document360.io/docs/public-apis:
  - Authorization requires adding a Platform API Token to the Authorization header.
    Include the token value obtained from Step 1 in the Authorization header when
    making requests to https://api.traceable.ai/graphql.
