- Most organisms interact with other organisms in some way or another, and how they
  do so usually defines how they fit into an ecosystem.
- Establishment means describes how a species arrived where it currently occurs. Introduced
  means it arrived because of human activity.
- Reptilian skin is covered in a horny epidermis, making it watertight and enabling
  reptiles to live on dry land.
- Reptiles shed their skin through a process called ecdysis which occurs continuously
  throughout their lifetime.
- Deaths from snakebites are uncommon in many parts of the world, but are still counted
  in tens of thousands per year in India.
- Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake.
- Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, and are farmed commercially.
- Snake farming has been troubling for conservation in the past as it can lead to
  overexploitation of wild snakes and their natural prey to supply the farms.
- Turtle farming is another known but controversial practice.
- Turtles have multiple circulatory and physiological adaptations to enable them to
  go long periods without breathing.
- Turtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors but do not form pair-bonds or social
  groups.
- Turtles lay their eggs on land, though some lay eggs near water.
- The length of incubation for turtle eggs varies depending on species.
- Establishment means describes how a species arrived where it currently occurs. Introduced
  means it arrived because of human activity, while native means it arrived without
  human assistance. Endemic species only occur in a specific place and nowhere else.
- Includes various clades and species of mammals.
- Genera Alveugena, Ambilestes and Procerberus are the immediate outgroups to order
  Taeniodonta, with genus Alveugena classified as a sister taxon to this order.

  and some shrews.

  or regions use different common names in the same language.
- The shedding of scales is called ecdysis (or in normal usage, molting or sloughing).
- Snakes shed the complete outer layer of skin in one piece.

- Hymenoptera are highly susceptible to habitat loss, leading to decreases in species
  richness.
- Some datasets may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates.

- The application of DNA barcoding to taxonomy further complicates this; a 2016 barcoding
  analysis estimated a total count of nearly 100,000 insect species for Canada alone,
  and extrapolated that the global insect fauna must be in excess of 10 million species,
  of which nearly 2 million are in a single fly family known as gall midges (Cecidomyiidae).
- Not including parasitoids.
- Agnatha as traditionally defined is paraphyletic, that is, a taxon including all
  jawless fishes, but if one only includes living species then the group becomes monophyletic.
- Major groups within phyla include Sponges, Cnidarians, Chordates, Echinoderms, Hemichordates,
  Nematodes, Arthropods, Platyhelminths, Ectoproctans, Annelids, Molluscs.
- Most categories of organisms have 'common names' in spoken languages. These names
  are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce, and stable over time, but many organisms
  have several different names in different places, even in the same language, which
  can make it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.
- Canada geese have reached Northern Europe naturally, as has been proved by ringing
  recoveries.
- Canada geese were introduced as a game bird into New Zealand in 1905.
- Canada geese can respond to external climatic factors by adjusting their laying
  date to spring maximum temperatures.
- Geese have a tendency to attack humans when they feel themselves or their goslings
  to be threatened.

- The monarch's lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they
  breed.
- Climate change may dramatically affect the monarch migration.
- The Puerto Rican monarch's primary host plants are red milkweed (*Asclepias curassavica*),
  which is native to North and South America, and giant milkweed (*Calotropis procera*),
  which is native to Europe.

- All orders added to the database
- The internal phylogeny of Lepidoptera is still being resolved.
- Interfamilial and superfamilial relationships are poorly understood.
- Declining butterfly populations have been noticed in many areas of the world, and
  this phenomenon is consistent with the rapidly decreasing insect populations around
  the world.
- At least in the Western United States, this collapse in the number of most species
  of butterflies has been determined to be driven by global climate change, specifically,
  by warmer autumns.

- Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age.
- 'Bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February,
  egg laying is often late February, and incubation is usually mid-March and early
  May.'
- The nest is the largest of any bird in North America and may eventually be as large
  as 4 m deep, 2.5 m across and weigh 1 metric ton.
- Usually nests are used for under five years, as they either collapse in storms or
  break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight.
- The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest
  confirmed one having been 38 years of age.

- Observations can demonstrate interactions such as Eating, Eaten by, and Host.
- Introduced means it arrived because of human activity
- Milkweeds are an important nectar source for native bees, wasps, and other nectar-seeking
  insects.
- 'Milkweeds use three primary defenses to limit damage caused by caterpillars: hairs
  on the leaves, cardenolide toxins, and latex fluids.'
- Monarch caterpillars do not favor butterfly weed (A. tuberosa), perhaps because
  the leaves of that milkweed species contain very little cardenolide.
- The fruits are edible raw but have little flavor.
- The pulp does not easily separate from the seeds.
- Most organisms interact with other organisms in some way or another.
