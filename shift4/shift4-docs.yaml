  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key as the username in HTTP
    Basic Auth (no password needed). Example: use `-u pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa:`
    where the API key is `pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa` followed by a colon.'
  - 'API key authentication is required. The API key is provided in the request using
    HTTP Basic Authentication, where the API key is the username and the password
    is left empty (format: `api_key:`). In the example, the key `pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa`
    is used with the `-u` flag in curl.'
  - API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. The API key is provided in the format
    `username:password` where the username is the API key (e.g., `pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa`)
    and password is empty, sent via the `-u` flag in curl or as an Authorization header
    with base64-encoded credentials.
  - Basic HTTP authentication using API key. Credentials are passed via the `-u` flag
    in curl (or `Authorization` header with base64-encoded `api_key:` format). The
    API key is placed before the colon with an empty password, e.g., `pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa:`.
  - Basic authentication is required using an API key as the username with an empty
    password. Send credentials via the Authorization header using HTTP Basic Auth
    (username:password format), where the username is your API key (e.g., pr_test_tXHm9qV9qV9bjIRHcQr9PLPa)
    and the password is left empty.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.shift4.com/docs/api:
  - Cursor-based pagination using optional query parameters startingAfterId (to get
    next page using the last object's id) and endingBeforeId (to get previous page
    using the first object's id). The limit parameter controls page size with a default
    of 10 and must be between 1 and 100.
  - Cursor-based pagination using optional query parameters startingAfterId and endingBeforeId.
    Pass the id value of the last object from the current page as startingAfterId
    to fetch the next page, or the id of the first object as endingBeforeId to fetch
    the previous page. Results are sorted by creation date with most recent first.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with startingAfterId (optional query parameter,
    use the last object's id from the previous response to get the next page) and
    endingBeforeId (optional query parameter, use the first object's id from the previous
    response to get the previous page). Results are sorted by creation date with most
    recent first.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with startingAfterId and endingBeforeId
    query parameters (both optional) to move forward and backward through pages respectively.
    Results are returned in a list array sorted by creation date, with a limit query
    parameter controlling page size (used in example as limit=3).
  - 'Pagination uses cursor-based parameters: startingAfterId (query, optional) to
    get the next page using the id of the last object from the previous response,
    and endingBeforeId (query, optional) to get the previous page. The response returns
    a list array containing objects.'
