auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/version-migration-guide-for-api-v3x:
  - 'Basic authentication is required using clientId and clientSecret credentials.
    Send these as an Authorization header in the format `Authorization: {clientId}:{clientSecret}`
    for PUT requests to the migration endpoint in both sandbox (https://sandbox.hostfully.com/api/version)
    and production (https://api.hostfully.com/api/version) environments.'
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/hostfully-graphql-api:
  - Authenticate the request by adding proper authorization headers. However, the
    documentation provided does not specify the exact header names, parameter names,
    or values required for authentication. To use this GraphQL API, you must include
    authorization headers in your requests, but the specific details of which headers
    and how to obtain credentials are not described in this excerpt.
  - Authorization headers are required to access the GraphQL API endpoint at https://sandbox-api.hostfully.com/api/v3/graphql.
    The documentation states that authorization headers must be added to load the
    GraphQL schema and send requests, but does not specify the exact header name,
    token type, or how to obtain credentials.
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/updateapiversion:
  - Authorization header is required as a string. The exact header name is Authorization.
    No additional details about the auth scheme, token format, or how to obtain credentials
    are provided in this documentation excerpt.
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/currentapiversion:
  - API key authentication is required via the Authorization header. Send your API
    key in the Authorization header for all requests to this endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/hostfully-graphql-api:
  - Pagination uses `_limit` and `_cursor` query parameters. The `_limit` parameter
    defaults to 20 with a maximum of 100. The response includes a `nextCursor` value
    in the `extensions` section, which should be passed as the `_cursor` parameter
    in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/getall_16:
  - Pagination uses _cursor (string) and _limit (string) as request parameters. Response
    includes _metadata object with count and totalCount fields, plus _paging object
    containing _limit (int32) and _nextCursor (string). Use _nextCursor value as _cursor
    in subsequent requests to fetch next page.
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/findleads:
  - The API uses limit-offset pagination. The _limit parameter (int32) specifies the
    number of results per request, and _cursor parameter (string) is used to navigate
    through pages. The response returns a leads array; use the _cursor value from
    the response to request the next page by passing it in the subsequent request.
- information_source; https://dev.hostfully.com/reference/findallmessagesforagency:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with _cursor (int32) as the request parameter
    and _nextCursor (string) in the response _paging object to retrieve subsequent
    pages. The _limit (int32) parameter controls page size, while count and totalCount
    fields indicate current and total message counts respectively.
  - Use query parameters _limit (int32) for page size and _cursor (string) for cursor-based
    pagination. The response contains a messages array. Continue pagination by using
    the _cursor value from the previous response in the next request.
