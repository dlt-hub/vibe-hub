auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.aylien.com:
  - Access tokens are obtained via OAuth2 password grant flow by posting username
    and password as HTTP basic auth to https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token with
    grant_type set to 'password'. The response contains access_token and refresh_token
    fields. Access tokens expire after one hour and must be refreshed using the refresh_token
    by posting to the same endpoint with grant_type set to 'refresh_token'. Refresh
    tokens are valid for 24 hours and a new refresh_token is issued with each token
    refresh request.
  - 'Aylien API uses OAuth2 password grant flow for authentication. Obtain an access
    token by sending a POST request to https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token with
    basic auth credentials (username as email and password), then include the token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" along with an AppId header
    for API requests.


    Required credentials: username (email), password, and AppID. Token endpoint: https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token
    with grant_type set to ''password''. Include Authorization header with format
    "Bearer {access_token}" and AppId header in subsequent API requests.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain an access token by calling https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token
    with your username, password, and Application ID. Pass the access_token value
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". Access tokens expire after
    one hour; use the provided refresh token to request a new token.
  - OAuth2 password grant flow with basic auth credentials. Obtain an access token
    by posting username and password to https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token with
    grant_type "password", then send the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}" along with an AppId header containing your app ID.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow with basic auth for initial token acquisition. POST
    to https://api.aylien.com/v1/oauth/token with grant_type 'refresh_token' and refresh_token
    in request body to get new access_token and refresh_token (valid 24 hours). Initial
    token acquisition uses HTTP basic auth with username and password, plus grant_type
    and appid in request body, returning access_token for subsequent API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.aylien.com/newsapi/v6/common-workflows/:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination. Request pagination via the `per_page` query
    parameter (default 100). The response includes a `next_page_cursor` header; pass
    this cursor value to the next request to retrieve subsequent pages. Continue paginating
    until no `next_page_cursor` is returned, indicating the final page.
