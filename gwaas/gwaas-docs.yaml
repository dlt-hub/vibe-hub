auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.gwaas.io/:
  - 'G-WaaS uses RSA2 authentication. Requests require two headers: X-Merchant-ID
    and Authorization. The Authorization header is generated by signing a base string
    (constructed from HTTP method, path, merchant ID, timestamp, and request body)
    with your private RSA key. Responses and notifications are verified using the
    public key provided by G-WaaS. You must generate an RSA key pair, submit the public
    key to the G-WaaS portal, and securely store your private key.'
  - Request signing using RSA SHA256 with a merchant ID. To authenticate, construct
    a base string from HTTP method, path, timestamp, and body, sign it with SHA256WithRSA
    using a private key, encode the signature in url-safe base64 format, and include
    it in the X-Merchant-ID header along with the merchant identifier.
  - 'The API requires two authorization methods: X-Merchant-Id header and Authorization
    header. Requests must include both headers; the exact credential values and format
    for the Authorization header are not specified in this documentation excerpt.'
  - 'This API requires two pieces of authorization information sent together: an X-Merchant-Id
    header and an Authorization header (likely a bearer token or API key). Both must
    be provided in the request headers to access the endpoint.'
  - 'Two authorization headers are required: X-Merchant-Id and Authorization. The
    specific values and format for these headers are not detailed in the provided
    documentation.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.gwaas.io/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (number, default 1) and limit (number, default
    20, max 1000) to control which page and how many results per page are returned.
    The response structure is not shown, so the stopping condition and response pagination
    fields cannot be determined from this documentation.
