auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3:
  - 'All requests to the GetResponse API must include authentication via a custom
    header. Send your API key in the X-Auth-Token header with the format "api-key
    YOUR_API_KEY". For example, if your API key is 84fsne83yrths947r6sfgg7w4he8, set
    the header X-Auth-Token: api-key 84fsne83yrths947r6sfgg7w4he8. Unused API keys
    expire for security reasons.'
  - 'X-Auth-Token header with api-key scheme is required for authentication. Send
    credentials as X-Auth-Token: api-key YOUR_API_KEY. API keys expire after 90 days
    and must be regenerated when expired.'
- information_source; https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Set the Authorization header to "Bearer"
    followed by an Access Token obtained from the OAuth 2.0 flow. For GetResponse
    MAX customers, include the X-Domain header with the client's domain name (without
    protocol). Optionally use X-Parent-Login header to specify a parent account login
    email to limit requests to that specific account.
  - 'The GetResponse API requires authentication on all requests using one of two
    methods: API Key (primary) or OAuth 2.0. For API Key authentication, add the header
    X-Auth-Token with value "api-key YOUR_API_KEY" to all requests. GetResponse MAX
    clients must additionally send an X-Domain header. Supported OAuth 2.0 flows include
    Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Implicit, and Refresh Token. API keys
    expire after 90 days of non-use.'
- information_source; https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}". OAuth2 is supported with Authorization Code,
    Implicit, and Refresh Token flows. For Implicit flow, redirect to https://app.getresponse.com/oauth2_authorize.html
    with response_type=token, client_id, redirect_uri, and state parameters. Access
    tokens expire and can be refreshed via the Refresh Token flow when a 401 error
    with code 1014 is received.
