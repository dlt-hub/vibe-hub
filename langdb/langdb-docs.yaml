notes:
- Requires LangDB project ID in the header.
- The UI shows only a few router variations. For all available options and advanced
  configurations, use the API.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Multi-tenancy, advanced cost control, and rate limiting. Contact LangDB for access.
- For large-scale deployments, use ClickHouse Cloud.
- LangDB provides OpenAI-compatible APIs, enabling developers to connect with multiple
  LLMs by changing just two lines of code.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Enable end-to-end tracing by using LangDB’s init() integration.
- LangDB’s ADK adapter captures request/response metadata, token usage, and latency
  metrics automatically.
- Requires setup of LangDB API key and project ID as environment variables
- Ensure to set your LangDB API key and project ID as environment variables.
- Initialize LangDB before configuring your LangChain/LangGraph.
- All calls to LLM, intermediate steps, tool executions, and nested chains are automatically
  traced and linked under a single session.
- LangDB automatically captures detailed traces of all agent interactions
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in LangDB
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Use environment variables for API keys and project ID.
- Requires setup of environment variables for API key and project ID
- Initialize tracing before configuring CrewAI code.
- Make sure to set environment variables for API key and project ID.
- Uses Bearer token for API access
- Messages define roles (`user`, `system`, `assistant`) to organize interactions clearly.
- Different roles (e.g., `system` for instructions, `user` for queries) enable complex
  workflows.
- Manage routing strategies easily in LangDB AI Gateway’s UI to boost efficiency,
  speed, and reliability in AI workflows.
- Supports parameters like temperature and max_tokens
- All chatCompletions requests to a Virtual Model endpoint automatically target the
  latest published version.
- Drafts and restored drafts never receive live traffic until published.
- LangDB provides a rich library of pre-built MCP servers.
- You can bring your own custom MCP server.
- Virtual models let you save, share, and reuse model configurations.
- Auto Router selects the most cost-effective model for queries
- Use model without provider → LangDB does provider routing.
- Add :mode suffix → pick between balanced, accuracy, cost, latency, or throughput.
- Use provider/model → pin a specific provider directly.
- LangDB provides a rich library of pre-built MCP servers
- You can connect a custom MCP server to leverage all benefits of a Virtual MCP Server
- Provides detailed tracing to monitor, debug, and optimize LLM workflows.
- LangDB simplifies how you work with MCP servers.
- MCP allows models to dynamically process contextual data.
- Uses provider routing for optimal cost, latency, and accuracy.
- LangDB AI Gateway optimizes LLM selection based on cost, speed, and availability,
  ensuring efficient request handling.
- Guardrails cannot be applied to streaming outputs.
- Role Management is only available in Professional, Business, and Enterprise tiers.
- MCP simplifies request orchestration across distributed AI systems, enhancing interoperability
  and context-awareness.
- Available in Business & Enterprise tiers under User Management.
- Set daily, monthly, and total spending limits per project.
- Response caching is designed for faster response times, reduced compute cost, and
  consistent outputs when handling repeated or identical prompts.
- Only Admins can configure model access restrictions
- Restricted models return access denied errors
- API usage metrics are available through the analytics endpoints.
- Only Admins can configure project access - other roles cannot modify these settings
- Users without project access cannot make API calls to restricted projects
- Set your credentials using environment variables LANGDB_API_KEY and LANGDB_PROJECT_ID.
- Provides a detailed timeseries view of API usage metrics.
- Always initialize LangDB before importing any framework-specific classes to ensure
  proper instrumentation.
- Most providers automatically enable prompt caching for large prompts, but some,
  like Anthropic, require you to enable it on a per-message basis.
- Initialize LangDB with API key and project ID.
- Only Admins can set which models are allowed per project
- Only Admins can configure project access - other roles cannot modify these settings.
- Users without project access cannot make API calls to restricted projects.
- API key and project ID are required for authentication.
- Ensure LANGDB_API_KEY and LANGDB_PROJECT_ID are set
- Check that initialization functions are called before creating agents
- Verify collector endpoint is accessible
- Initialize LangDB integration before other instrumentation
- Requires AWS Cognito for authentication.
- Ensure to handle token expiration appropriately.
- Uses API key for authentication — set LANGDB_API_KEY environment variable.
- Use LANGDB_API_KEY and LANGDB_PROJECT_ID environment variables for configuration.
- All purchases are non-refundable.
- We offer a 14-day free trial to new users who register with the Services.
- LangDB Gateway provides detailed tracing to monitor, debug, and optimize LLM workflows.
