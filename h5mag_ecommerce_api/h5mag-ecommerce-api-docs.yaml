notes:
- The e-commerce API is only available for Enterprise plans.
- H5mag is a standardised software-as-a-service cloud solution.
- Our platform is hosted in ISO-certified data centers around the world and is continuously
  monitored.
- The editor can be accessed anywhere in the world with a modern graphical web browser,
  and a keyboard and mouse for input.
- It is currently not possible to edit a magazine on a (tablet) device with touch
  input, or using old browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- If you wish to use another setup, please read below about the possibilities.
- Older versions of the browser may continue to work for some time, but new features
  of H5mag are not tested with older versions of the browsers.
- The editor also functions at lower resolutions, but not being able to see the whole
  artboard will seriously decrease productivity.
- The artboard switch is not a setting to set the article size.
- PDF / Print artboard is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the Edition Settings.
- H5mag does not automatically save your changes.
- It is recommended to save often to avoid losing work.
- If you forget to save an article and switch to another one, a yellow dashed border
  will indicate unsaved changes.
- Images should have a resolution of about 2 to 3 megapixels and be less than 5 MB
  in size.
- The maximum supported file size is 25 MB per image.
- You must have the right license for any custom webfonts uploaded.
- Saved Styles are shared within a single edition, changes will propagate to other
  articles and artboards.
- Each area type has its own set of Saved Styles.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Pop-ups are windows that show on top of your regular content.
- To create a popup you need to have a trigger.
- You can create a blank popup section or select an existing area to show as a popup.
- 'Currently, the following online social networks are supported: Facebook, Twitter,
  Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, Tumblr, VKontakte, Sina Weibo, WhatsApp.'
- The guides and grids can be used to assist you when you are designing your H5mag.
- The guides and grids are only visible in the editor, not in the preview mode or
  your published project.
- Changes saved will not be visible until the 'Update publication' button is pressed.
- The file being imported must have the .h5e extension in order to be recognized.
- H5mag accepts JPG, PNG, and SVG images.
- 'Last modified: Tuesday, 14 October 2025 - 12:26:04 CEST'
- The gallery area is an area that contains slides which may have multiple images
  and/or sections with text or other content in it.
- Looping through the slides is one of its great features.
- Activity Feeds are highly personalized to the reader (such as friends in their network),
  so the activity you see might be quite different to what your reader sees.
- 'Beware: embedding pages on websites that are not under your control can lead to
  unexpected results.'
- A 'heavy' page may slow down the browser, or even crash it. This is particularly
  a problem on older computers and tablets.
- Some mobile devices cannot display iframes, or the iframe's content might not be
  responsive.
- By default we zoom the contents of iframes. That means that iframes always display
  the same size, regardless of the screen size of your user.
- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of connected app in H5mag
- The text area has a setting for columns using CSS columns.
- Older browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 will render everything in one
  large column.
- The length of your publication should match your goals and target audience.
- A good rule of thumb for marketing-related publications is about 10 pages.
- 'Deliverable: online publication with master pages, ready to add content'
- You can have multiple accounts and give one to each person involved.
- You can share an unpublished version using the preview button.
- For every font variant (*bold*, *italic*, *light*...) another webfont needs to be
  loaded, which will increase the loading times.
- To ensure an optimal user experience across different devices, apply auto height
  for text areas instead of fixed height.
- All images should be in an RGB colorspace. Images that are in CMYK or other colorspace
  will be converted and may lose some fidelity.
- For a background image to fit on an iPad tablet (with an aspect ratio of 4:3) on
  landscape and portrait mode the image should be at least 1024 by 1024 pixels.
- Don't forget that for retina devices double the pixels is needed, so images with
  a width of 2048 pixels are preferred.
- The built-in analytics is activated automatically.
- When using external trackers, user permission may be required.
- Access to the datasets module is available through the API.
- An API key is required to utilize all functionalities of the datasets API.
- While our AI module utilizes cutting-edge technology for high-quality translations
  and replacements, occasional errors can occur (e.g., a missed translation). We always
  recommend reviewing the changes to ensure everything meets your standards.
- Currently available to Enterprise subscribers.
- Readers can subscribe through a subscribe page linked in the edition.
- The subscribe action can be added to an area inside an article.
- You are only able to add emails if you have consent of all the e-mail owners you
  want to add.
- Push notifications are faster than e-mails and will be able to reach your subscribers
  in a different way than e-mails.
- In order for your project to enable push notification on Safari (MacOS) you will
  have to upload a web push certificate.
- E-mail notifications engage subscribers with new editions.
- Every setting has a default and doesn't have to be changed or added.
- You can only send notifications for published edition.
- A push notification will appear on screen if you have allowed your browser to send
  it.
- You can pause or stop the notification you were trying to send.
- Only the e-mail notification is available as preview.
- We track how many subscribers opened and clicked on their notification.
- This information is essential for tracking how successful your notifications are
  doing.
- Safari push notifications require a Web Push certificate.
- You will need one if you want to give the subscribers of your project the possibility
  to subscribe for push notifications with Safari.
- If you can't meet the requirements required for generating your certificate contact
  us.
- We could arrange a web push certificate for you with our own Apple Developer Account.
- 'Importing one subscriber costs 1 task. For example: importing 600 subscribers costs
  600 Zapier tasks.'
- Copy your public API key from https://account.h5mag.com/account/api and paste it
  in the 'API key' input field
- Requires setup of connected app in H5mag
- Some API responses may vary based on user permissions
- Note that we don't provide support on the use of CSS and Javascript within H5mag,
  unless you are on our Enterprise plan with a service contract.
- Enterprise users can customize the navigation bar.
- 'You can choose between existing themes: Obsidian Black (Default), Silver, Snow
  White.'
- The Progress Bar is a visual indicator that shows a reader’s position within an
  edition.
- H5mag offers flexible customization to tailor the progress bar to your magazine's
  design and user experience needs.
- By default the reader will need to press a ‘Grant Permission’ button the first time
  they sign in.
- You can restrict access to the editions to a set of users.
- By adding `?autoplay=1` to your edition's URL, your magazine will play automatically
  in a loop.
- Single-Sign-On (SSO) using Okta is only available on the H5mag Enterprise plan.
- To prevent users from seeing their Okta username where H5mag displays the users
  email address, please set the 'Application username format' to 'Email' in the Sign
  On tab.
- The Import and Group option are not supported at this time. You will have to manually
  assign your users to H5mag.
- H5mag does not support groups.
- The value of the mail user attribute in Azure AD is only populated if the user has
  a Microsoft Exchange Mailbox.
- Bodymoving is a rendering plugin which converts the animations you create in After
  Effects to web compatible animations that can be displayed in H5mag.
- Remember not to use Photoshop files, scripts, or effects, and to ensure that all
  text is outlined.
- Make sure the project platform is 'HTML5 Canvas'
- H5mag only supports JavaScript/HTML format for animations
- Presentation Mode allows the content of an edition to be displayed continuously.
- By default, Presentation Mode is switched off.
- Tracking only works when the required fields are correctly filled in.
- You don't need to manually add the tracking script to your publications. H5mag handles
  the integration automatically.
- If you change any of the Salesforce settings, your editions will be automatically
  updated to include the latest tracking info.
