notes:
- All requests are made via POST method.
- All data is sent and received as JSON.
- Uses HTTP Basic Authentication — requires API key
- FOSSBilling should function correctly on any MySQL compatible database such as MySQL
  or MariaDB.
- FOSSBilling will work correctly on any of the following web-servers. For the greatest
  simplicity we suggest either using Apache or Apache behind an NGINX reverse proxy
  (with NGINX caching static files).
- To use remote images in your PDFs (images accessed via a URL) you should have allow_url_fopen
  set to true.
- If the cron job is not configured, then FOSSBilling will not operate correctly.
- FOSSBilling requires a dedicated domain or sub-domain.
- Requires external database configuration during installation.
- Cron job must be configured for proper operation.
- FOSSBilling can handle the update process automatically for you. This can be accessed
  by logging into your admin panel and going to system —> update.
- Make sure you have a backup of your database before making changes directly to the
  database.
- Do not use your actual password when generating a hash.
- FOSSBilling includes all official translations that are at least 25% complete.
- The default locale is defined inside of the config.php file.
- FOSSBilling includes all of the official translations that are at least 25% complete
  in its releases.
- The default locale that FOSSBilling uses is defined inside of the config.php file.
- When changing the logo, there are two configurable options. One for dark mode, and
  one for light mode. If no dark mode logo is provided, FOSSBilling will use the standard
  logo.
- In general, we recommend storing the logo inside of your theme’s assets, however
  in theory you may provide a link to a logo hosted elsewhere.
- Please do not change the default themes/huraga/assets/img/logo.svg file, as this
  will be overridden with the default file whenever you update FOSSBilling.
- If you change the logo and the changes aren’t reflected, please try clearing both
  your browser’s cache and the FOSSBilling cache.
- dompdf does not offer complete CSS support.
- Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
- Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
- Does not support CSS flexbox.
- Does not support CSS Grid.
- Please, do not change the default `themes/huraga/assets/img/logo.svg` file, as this
  will be overridden with the default file whenever you update FOSSBilling.
- Variables sent to email templates will not be known until an email template is sent
  at least once, at which point the preview button becomes enabled and the Variables
  tab will then have the variables and data from the last email that was sent.
- HTML support from different email clients varies
- The API wrapper uses a CSRF token for requests.
- More detailed documentation will be provided in the future.
- One important note to make, is that dompdf does not offer complete CSS support.
- Invoices gain access to the same filters that Twig does on the front-end with FOSSBilling.
- FOSSBilling by default implements a basic rate-limiter on all API requests.
- Domain prices are static and configured on a TLD basis. FOSSBilling cannot and will
  not use pricing from your registrar at this stage.
- Available TLDs are hard-coded inside of domain registrars.
- Limited registrar support.
- Downloadable products are implemented in FOSSBilling and are in a usable state.
- 'Implemented, but in a fairly simplistic way and without some creature comforts,
  such as: No way to import existing accounts from a control panel.'
- When you suspend an order, the suspension reason is not sent to the control panel
  and is only used on the FOSSBilling end.
- No support for SSO (logging clients into the control panel automatically).
- FOSSBilling utilizes the popular Twig templating engine for various purposes (front-end,
  email templates, PDFs, etc.).
- The license product type is included with FOSSBilling by default, but you must install
  and enable it from the Extensions tab.
- Be cautious when implementing custom validation rules as errors will prevent licenses
  from validating.
- Accounts will only follow the limits as set within WHM and the details you configure
  in FOSSBilling don’t matter as long as the package name matches.
- While FOSSBilling will create the package for you, changes to the package within
  FOSSBilling will not be synced to the WHM server and as such any changes will need
  to be manually performed on the WHM server.
- When creating the access key inside HestiaCP, you only need to assign 'billing'
  permissions for the key you create.
- FOSSBilling cannot create hosting packages automatically.
- FOSSBilling does not support Pterodactyl.
- This guide is incomplete. Please help us complete it using the 'Edit this page'
  button in the sidebar.
- Ensure that your reverse proxy is forwarding the X-Forwarded-Proto header and that
  it’s correctly set to https.
- FOSSBilling is a work in progress and may not be stable for production sites.
- When you suspend an order, the suspension reason is not sent to the control panel
  and is only used on the FOSSBilling end (Such as in an email to the client).
- Error reporting is handled via Sentry.io with data being recorded in a secure and
  compliant manner with a maximum retention of 90 days.
- Introduced the ability for FOSSBilling to migrate configuration files.
- FOSSBilling can now switch between release and preview branches for the automatic
  update tool.
- Default length of license key is 25 characters.
- If you are upgrading from versions older than 0.6.0, please check the changelog
  for breaking changes.
- WHM will not let you view the token again after it's generated.
- Changes to the package within FOSSBilling will not be synced to the WHM server.
- This release has a lot of changes, many of which are breaking changes.
- Please review the entire release notes before updating.
- Attempting to use a hosting plan with a name such as 'Plan 1' won't work correctly,
  instead it should be named 'Plan1'.
- Due to technical limitations between FOSSBilling and CWP, FOSSBilling cannot create
  hosting packages automatically.
- At this time, we want to focus on improving the stability and usability of FOSSBilling.
- This version of FOSSBilling removes quite a few deprecated functions and as such
  this release has the possibility to break custom themes and modules.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Security starts at the network and server levels.
- Make sure that your server OS is kept up to date with the latest security patches
  at all times.
- Do not run things as a root user unless you absolutely have to.
- Use SSH keys to login to your server rather than relying on passwords.
- Do not allow remote access to anything unless you have a valid reason.
- Close any ports that do not explicitly need to be publicly accessible.
- Support for subfolder installations was deprecated in FOSSBilling 0.4.2.
- Enabling the 'Auto Minify' feature with Cloudflare can cause issues within the admin
  panel.
- FOSSBilling is currently considered pre-production software. While we are working
  hard to make it production-ready, we do not recommend using it in production yet.
- Enable IP Geolocation under your website’s Network settings.
- FOSSBilling is very much a work in progress.
- Backup and test things in a staging environment.
- FOSSBilling will automatically execute cron when you log into the admin panel (as
  long as it hasn’t been executed in at least 15 minutes). Can be disabled via the
  disable_auto_cron option in the config file.
- FOSSBilling will log a stack trace when an exception is thrown with debugging on.
  (log_stacktrace and stacktrace_length in the config file).
- FOSSBilling has a new maintenance mode which can be configured and enabled via the
  config file.
- If you are upgrading from versions older than 0.6.0, please check the changelog
  for that release as well for breaking changes.
- For those of you who are upgrading from versions older than 0.6.0, please check
  the changelog for that release as well as it included some major changes, including
  backwards-incompatible ones.
- Numerous breaking changes that effect theming.
- PHP 8.0 is no longer supported.
- 'Important: We have changed the way update patches are performed. After updating,
  you MUST manually login to the administrator panel, navigate to the updater, and
  then use the “Apply Patches & Update Configuration” button.'
