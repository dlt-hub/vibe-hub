notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with authorization code flow.
- Uses Google Auth with workload identity provider and service account
- You can specify a contextId to use a reference library in a diagram generation API
  call.
- Requires setup of connected app in Eraser
- Some API calls may require specific contextId
- SAML SSO is only available to customers on the Business Plan and Enterprise Plan.
- The Confluence app is installed at the site-level. Any Confluence teammate that
  wants to newly embed Eraser figure or files will not need to install the app. They
  may be required to authenticate with Eraser depending on the embedding method.
- Usage-based pricing allows users to extend their usage of AI credits beyond plan
  limits. Usage-based pricing is only available on paid plans.
- API calls require usage-based pricing to be enabled.
- Any Confluence teammate that wants to newly embed Eraser figure or files will not
  need to install the app.
- Viewers will need to authenticate via Eraser in the case of previews of private
  files and files with no link access.
- Usage-based pricing allows users to extend their usage of AI credits beyond plan
  limits.
- The `contextId` can be obtained using the library selection dropdown in the AI references
  page.
