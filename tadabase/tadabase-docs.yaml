client:
  auth: To use API token authorization with Tadabase, you will need an API token,
    which can be obtained from the Tadabase documentation; this token must be included
    in the request headers for authentication. Additionally, you will also need to
    manage a refresh token, which is received along with the access token upon initial
    authorization, to maintain access as it requires periodic refreshing.

  paginator: Pagination is required, and it can be applied by enabling the **Show
    Pagination setting** within the **Options tab** of a table component.
