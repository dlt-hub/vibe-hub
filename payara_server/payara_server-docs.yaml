  : - Basic authentication (username and password) or API key authentication via token_cookie
      are required. Send credentials using HTTP Basic Auth or include the token_cookie
      in the request.
    - Basic authentication scheme named simple_auth is required. Send credentials
      using the HTTP Authorization header with the format "Basic base64(username:password)".
      The X-Requested-By header is also required for this endpoint.
    - In order to successfully consume the endpoints in this API, one of 2 described
      security schemes must be used if the domain's access is secured. The documentation
      references two security schemes but does not explicitly detail their names,
      header/parameter requirements, or how to implement them in the provided text.
      The X-Requested-By header is mentioned as required for the POST operation but
      appears to be a standard request header rather than an authentication mechanism.
      A 401 response indicates credential-based authentication is enforced, but the
      specific auth scheme details are not included in this excerpt.
    - 'The API supports two authentication methods: basic auth (named simple_auth)
      and API key authentication via cookie (named token_cookie). For session-based
      authentication, POST to /management/sessions with the X-Requested-By header
      to retrieve a session token that can be used for subsequent administration and
      monitoring operations.'
    - This API supports two authentication schemes. Basic authentication is available
      via the simple_auth scheme, which requires standard HTTP Basic Auth credentials
      (username and password encoded in base64) sent in the Authorization header.
      Additionally, an API key authentication scheme named token_cookie is available,
      which uses a token passed via cookie. Both schemes are required for the documented
      endpoints, as indicated by the Security tables showing both basic and apiKey
      type entries.
