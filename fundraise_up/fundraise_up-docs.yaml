auth_info:
- information_source; https://fundraiseup.com/docs/nxt-api/:
  - 'API key authentication using Bearer token in the Authorization header. Include
    the API key as "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" in request headers. All requests
    must use HTTPS. The API key should be created with minimum required permissions
    (e.g., "Retrieve donation data") and stored securely like a password.'
- information_source; https://fundraiseup.com/docs/rest-api-resources/?eco_budget=middle:
  - "Authenticate to the API using HTTP Bearer authentication by including your API\
    \ key in the Authorization header as \"Authorization: Bearer test_\u2026\". All\
    \ requests must be made over HTTPS; requests without proper authentication or\
    \ over HTTP will be rejected. Each API key is scoped to its account; parent accounts\
    \ cannot create donations for subaccounts using the parent API key, but can export\
    \ data for both parent and subaccounts."
- information_source; https://fundraiseup.com/docs/seamless-donor-portal/:
  - API key authentication is required. Generate an API key in Dashboard > Settings
    > API keys with the "Generate Donor Portal access links" permission enabled. The
    API key must be sent in the Authorization header (standard bearer token format)
    when making requests to the donor portal access links endpoint. Parent account
    API keys cannot be used for subaccounts; a separate API key must be generated
    within the specific subaccount.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.fundraiseup.com/v1/docs/:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with limit query parameter (default or specified
    value) and starting_after query parameter. The starting_after parameter accepts
    the last donation ID from the previous response to fetch the next page. Records
    are returned in reverse chronological order, and pagination stops when no more
    records are available or the desired date range is reached.
- information_source; https://fundraiseup.com/docs/nxt-api/:
  - Collection endpoints use limit, starting_after, and ending_before query parameters
    for cursor-based pagination. The limit parameter controls page size, starting_after
    and ending_before specify cursor positions to fetch records before or after a
    given ID.
- information_source; https://fundraiseup.com/docs/rest-api-resources/?eco_budget=middle:
  - Cursor-based pagination using `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters
    (mutually exclusive). Request includes `limit` query parameter to control page
    size. Response contains `data` array and `has_more` boolean field indicating whether
    more records exist. Use the last record ID from the response as `starting_after`
    value in the next request to fetch subsequent pages.
