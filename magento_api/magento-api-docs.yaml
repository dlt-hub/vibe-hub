notes:
- Magento 2 cron groups optimize the execution of automated background tasks.
- Groups provide better resource management than individual jobs.
- Magento 2 supports both REST and SOAP API architectures.
- Developers can choose the appropriate architecture based on their requirements.
- Caching strategies like adding lifetimes and tags reduce API response times.
- Rate limiting prevents server overload during traffic spikes.
- GraphQL field selection cuts unnecessary data transfer.
- Proper error handling maintains reliable uptime performance.
- Essential security protocols protect against vulnerabilities.
- Uses OAuth2 for secure API authentication
- Optimized API calls can reduce server costs and improve performance
- Caching can expose sensitive data if misconfigured.
- Use Redis for session storage.
- Order state transitions trigger automated sync between Magento and external systems.
- 4 core integration methods connect Magento 2 with external systems.
- Authentication failures prevent systems from accessing return information.
- Data structure mismatches stop return requests from processing.
- Magento API authentication improves security without disrupting workflows.
- Token security relies on regular rotation and encryption.
- Enforce HTTPS for all API calls to encrypt data in transit.
- Magento REST API uses token-based authentication.
- SOAP API supports WS-Security for authentication.
- API endpoints allow easy product, order, and customer management.
- Proper API integration enhances store performance and customer experience.
- Configuring pagination improves user experience on your website.
- Each API call requires a secure token, ensuring only authorized users can access
  data.
