notes:
- Rage Click events can be triggered via the browser client API.
- Be careful about which behaviors you trigger via this event, as it can be spoofed
  by a malicious actor.
- Events may be duplicated in your warehouse (less than 1%).
- Use version 2.0 of the Fullstory snippet
- Use a version of fs.js later than August 3rd, 2023
- The Fullstory API employs a number of safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic
  to help maximize its stability.
- When a rate limit is hit a `Retry-After` header will be included with the response.
- Property names can only contain a sequence of alphanumeric characters A-Z, a-z,
  or 0-9 and underscores ('_').
- The maximum property name length is 512 characters.
- Properties have a maximum value size of 8192 bytes.
- A session url or ID can only be returned by FS('getSession') if capture has begun.
- To be assured of getting a session url, you can use FS('observe') or FS('getSessionAsync').
- The Fullstory Browser API is available once the Fullstory data capture snippet is
  installed on your users' browser.
- Once the Fullstory script loads, it captures all web based interactions and mutations.
- The V2 API allows for user data creation and management for users that have not
  already been captured in a session.
- Capture up to 50 unique properties (exclusive of pageName) on a single page.
- Capture up to 500 unique properties across all pages.
- pageName field is limited to 1,000 unique pageName values across your site.
- Type annotations for custom properties are no longer necessary in version 2.
- Field types will be inferred from the values in the properties field.
