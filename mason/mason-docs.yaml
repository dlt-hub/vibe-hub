notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Devices will default to the 'Unassigned' group.
- Any given device may only belong to one group at a time.
- Authentication for the platform is done via API keys.
- All commands in the Mason CLI require a permissioned API key.
- Mason OS configuration files are defined using the YAML file format - .yml.
- 'Only two fields are required: name and version.'
- Devices can now be shutdown remotely using controller command shutdown.
- Disabling booting to bootloader while pressing both device keys when booting up
- X-Ray is not supported in this release
- NFC is disable by default, this is because when enabled the screen flickers.
- Some Mason OS configurations do not function on A4100.
- Cannot change date, time, timezone during device setup.
- Devices must be turned on and connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data.
- A prompt will appear on the device when you initially establish a connection. This
  prompt needs to be accepted within 30 seconds.
- Groups can only be created via Controller or the Mason Platform APIs at this time.
- Projects are a way to organize a set of configs and deploy them to your fleet of
  devices.
- Groups allow you to organize your devices according to your workflows and needs.
- Refurbishing a device will wipe all data from your Mason device and restore it to
  its original, pre-provisioned state.
- Make sure you have physical access to the device prior to a refurbish.
- Splash images must be in .png format and square.
- The maximum image width should match the device’s resolution size.
- Compressing the .zip file can create an extra sub directory.
- 'Mason supports three types of deployments: project builds, applications, and MasonOS
  updates.'
- A properly configured fleet will survive factory resets.
