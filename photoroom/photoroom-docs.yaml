notes:
- Free API calls available.
- API key is tied to your account and should be kept secret.
- Sandbox mode allows free API calls but will produce a result with a watermark.
- 10 free API calls to the Remove Background API when you create your account.
- Sandbox mode enables you to make free API calls and doesn't require purchasing a
  subscription.
- The Photoroom API uses standard HTTP calls, which makes it easy to integrate with
  any programming language or networking framework.
- The default rate limit is 60 images per minute.
- Photoroom doesn’t save the images that are processed through the Photoroom API.
- API is rate limited to 500 calls/minutes
- Make sure not to include 'sandbox_' when copy/pasting your API key
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires an API key for access.
- Body type must be set to Multipart/form-data.
- API key is required and needs to be replaced in the code.
- 'You will need an API key, you can get it here: https://app.photoroom.com/api-dashboard'
- The Shortcut needs to be configured with an API Key in order to be functional.
- API calls can include as many edit options as needed, with no impact on the price.
- For testing and prototyping, you can use sandbox mode, which allows you to make
  free calls to the Image Editing API.
- 'Maximum File Size: 30MB'
- 'Maximum Resolution: 5,000 pixels on the widest side'
- Only XMP metadata is supported for preservation. Other types such as EXIF or IPTC
  will be removed regardless of the setting.
- When keepExistingAlphaChannel is set to auto, if the image has an alpha channel,
  its value will be used to create the cutout mask.
- Get your API key from the API dashboard.
- To control the pixel density, set the argument export.dpi to a value between 72
  and 1200 (included).
- You can make up to 1,000 free calls by month to the Image Editing API using sandbox
  mode (the max per day is 100 calls).
- Sandbox mode is meant to be used for testing and prototyping, and will produce an
  image with a watermark.
- The uncertainty score is a number between 0 and 1.
- 'The API supports two formats to specify the amount padding: relative values, expressed
  in percentages, and absolute values, expressed in pixels.'
- If the percentage of padding on two opposing sides is greater than or equal to 100%,
  it will lead to an error.
- Set the argument textRemoval.mode with values ai.artificial, ai.natural, or ai.all
  to control text removal.
- Text-Guided Segmentation is available as an alpha feature.
- The feature might be deprecated with two week warning.
- Templating mode is available as an alpha feature.
- Currently, the Image Editing API v2 does not yet offer all the features that the
  v1 used to.
- Using this API is appropriate if you only need to remove the background of your
  image, and don't need to perform any additional edits.
- Each API call is priced at $0.02
- By default, the result image will be in PNG format.
- The Image Editing API is part of our Plus plan and calling this API is more expensive
  than calling the Remove Background API.
- When returning the segmentation mask, the matting process will not be applied.
- In some cases, we might not be able to return an uncertainty score (e.g. if an image
  contains humans), in that case the value -1 will be returned.
- 'This feature only works for green screen: it will not do anything for pictures
  that use a blue screen or any color other than green.'
- 'All green color tones on the main subject will be affected by the feature: this
  means that for a person wearing green clothing, the color of the clothing will be
  modified.'
- With just these three easy steps, you can integrate the Photoroom Background Removal
  API into your web app and provide your users with high-quality images with clean
  backgrounds.
- Please be aware that this will make your API key accessible to anyone browsing your
  website. If your website is public, we recommend calling our API through a proxy
  that you control (Firebase / Google functions, AWS lambda).
- Get your API key from the API Dashboard.
- Get your API key from the API Dashboard
- Please replace with your own apiKey
- API key is required for authentication through the x-api-key header.
- You need to get your API key to use the Photoroom API.
errors:
- '429: Rate limit exceeded'
- 'Unauthorized: If your call is resulting in this error, you either forgot to put
  your apiKey in the headers or your credit balance has reached zero'
- 'Error: Handle request exceptions properly.'
- Calling the API twice with the same input image and the same edit options will be
  billed as 2 separate calls.

- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
