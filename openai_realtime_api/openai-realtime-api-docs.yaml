notes:
- The new Realtime API is stateful and defines a bidirectional events protocol on
  top of a long-lived WebSocket connection.
- Automatic phrase endpointing and interruption handling are built in.
- Maximum context length is 128,000 tokens.
- Maximum amount of time for a single session is 15 minutes.
- The AI Engineer newsletter + Top 10 US Tech podcast.
- 'Important note: submissions here will all be considered for acceptance, but speakers
  with accepted talks from the MCP process will need to fill out Sessionize anyway
  to complete their acceptance when we notify you via email.'

- Some models may incur significant costs even at limited rates.
- AI Engineers can find and exploit capabilities simply by spending more time with
  the models, and applying them to a domain that is undervalued by research.
- The sheer volume of papers and models and techniques published each day is exponentially
  increasing with interest and funding.
