notes:
- The front-end is built with a simple Bootstrap/JQuery based MDB framework and hosted
  with Gitlab Pages
- Compressed image size is 358Mb. Uncompressed size is 1.9Gb.
- Fury will be used exclusively for dep/rpm artifacts
- Uses basic authentication with admin credentials
- Insecure mode is used to not enforce the TLS transport
- python3 does not come included yet in Amazon Linux
- It is very easy to fetch python3
- Uses AWS Lambda and Serverless framework.
- Lambda function can read/write to AWS S3.
- Re-deployment will create another Lambda with updated IAM role allowing full-access
  to S3 objects of bucket `rdodin`.
- You can pass the exam without having hands-on experience by studying the AWS Study
  Guide.
- The Free Tier offering by AWS can minimize costs for practice.
- Uploading multiple files to AWS S3 in parallel may result in slow upload speeds
  when triggered through the AWS Management Console.
- The aws s3 sync command is efficient for uploading missing files or syncing remote
  parts with local ones.
- BGP requires IGP to be configured before setup.
- iBGP sessions are established inside BGP Autonomous System.
- The reason we need to provide a full-mesh of iBGP sessions is dictated by the iBGP
  split-horizon rule.
- Uses recursive lookup to determine next-hop for routes.
- BGP communities are used for granular management of routes.
- The no-advertise community prevents advertising to iBGP peers.
- Community remove operation removes a single community per action.
- Requires setup of PE-CE relationships
- BGP configuration may vary between PE routers
- Configuration includes exporting loopback addresses via eBGP.
- OSPF is used as the PE-CE protocol on CE2_ALU.
- This project aggregates Python scripts to be used via a Web UI.
- Template inheritance allows you to build a base 'skeleton' template that contains
  all the common elements of your site and defines blocks that child templates can
  override.
- One of the best practices regarding template inheritance is to compose a 'base template'
  or a layout for the whole site so every other template will inherit from it.
- In rare cases the script couldn't compose the whole link, in that case use the moID
  value specified in the output section to compose VMRC link manually.
- Serialized data is sent via POST method
- Response data is returned as JSON formatted structure
- Blueprints allow modularization of the application.
- Use the Horizon all the time unless the task assumes CLI approach.
- Verify the connection requirements, as the exam's virtual-room environment is sensitive
  to a browser version and connection quality.
- Being able to pull SR Linux NOS as any other container image is big on its own,
  but we also wanted to make sure that you can use right away.
- Integration tests use the containerlab binary built with coverage enabled.
- GOCOVERDIR environment variable must be set to store coverage reports.
- 'Error: nginx: [emerg] open() "/run/nginx/nginx.pid" failed (2: No such file or
  directory) - change pid file location in Alpine Linux.'
- nginx configuration requires adjustment for Alpine Linux to avoid pid file errors
- uWSGI requires python plugin installation in Alpine Linux
- Uses NETCONF with subtree filtering for retrieving user configurations
- No IP/DNS address is present, as we are not using SSH to access the node.
- gNMI service is configured to use the created TLS profile.
- The FTP server configuration must allow writing to /dev/null.
- 'Use append command instead of put to avoid the 500 OOPS: ftruncate error.'
- Uses ngrok to expose local ports
- Tear down process is as simple as 'pkill fwd && pkill ngrok'
- Function is deployed using serverless framework
- Project name should match the project name created in GCP
- Function is triggered by HTTP requests.
- Ensure GCP account is set up with billing for functions to work.
- Function is triggered by an HTTP request
- Function requires a JSON payload containing 'data' and optionally 'root'.
- Function is triggered by an HTTP event.
- All the tags, branches are preserved with this procedure, although I do not guarantee
  that the workflow will work in your case. Do a backup always.
- Currently the latest gNMI version (0.7.0.) has been 'mapped'
- Supports TLS and non-TLS transports
- Configuration can be specified via CLI flags or file-based configurations
- Supports both TLS and non-TLS transports
- Output defaults to JSON format
- gNMIc supports dynamic loading of gNMI targets from external systems and services.
- If you wish to have the extension use a separate $GOPATH for its tools, provide
  the desired location in the setting go.toolsGopath.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Backup existing ~/.kube/config file: you don''t want to lose your existing kubeconfig
  because you messed up something in your script or overwrote it with a wrong kubeconfig.'
- Find paths to all kubeconfig files in a particular directory and set them as a KUBECONFIG
  environment variable.
- Keep all my kubeconfigs in ~/.kube/cluster_configs directory and run this script
  whenever I add or delete a kubeconfig in this directory.
- 'Commands must be executed in sequence: destroy, undefine, and delete disk images.'
- Use grep and xargs to automate the deletion of multiple VMs.
- SLOW PROTOCOLS INCLUSIVE (and NO external dependencies)
- NETCONF subtree filtering allows efficient retrieval of configuration elements.
- Many Network OS'es can not emit JSON for any given command.
- The legacy gear is out there, with no other management interface but SSH/SNMP.
- YANG data models are the map one should use when looking for their way to configure
  or retrieve any data on SR Linux system.
- Rootifier web service is a Flask application deployed in a container in ElasticBeanstalk
  on AWS.
- OSPFv2 configuration steps and commands for Nokia SROS routers.
- OSPF operates based on area configurations and link state advertisements.
- Routes are verified to be propagated properly across routers
- Route summarization procedure automatically adds a black-hole route.
- Route filtering does not install any black-hole routes.
- Route summarization procedure automatically adds a black-hole route in R1's route
  table.
- OSPF Stub Areas help to optimize LSDB and routing tables of the routers.
- Configuring Area 2 as totally stub reduces LSDB and route tables.
- Hello interval mismatch can cause neighbor relationships to break.
- NSSA areas can not contain External routes.
- IP filter configuration requires specifying match statements for traffic control.
- Cisco routers successfully form neighbor relationships even if OSPF interfaces configured
  with different types, however no OSPF routes will be installed into routing tables
  since OSPF database information is inconsistent.
- Nowadays it is best-practice to configure Ethernet interfaces between directly connected
  OSPF routers in a point-to-point type to reduce convergence time.
- It is possible to configure different interface’s type on a single network segment
  between OSPF routers. Especially interesting the case when one interface configured
  with point-to-point type and the other with broadcast.
- Cisco routers form neighbor relationships even if OSPF interfaces configured with
  different types, however no OSPF routes will be installed into routing tables since
  OSPF database information is inconsistent.
- This Cisco’s behavior can lead to unnecessary troubleshooting since adjacency seems
  up yet no OSPF routes will be seen in routing table.
- Alcatel-Lucent and Juniper routers effectively prevent adjacency to form in such
  case. They drop incoming to point-to-point interface Hello packets if they contain
  DR/BDR IP addresses other then zero.
- Uses Paramiko to check SSH service readiness
- Catches specific exceptions to determine connection status
- Uses docker-credential-gcr for authentication with GCP
- Other clouds might require other helpers or file mounts
- UKSM is a kernel feature and the way it is distributed nowadays is via patch files
- If you don't want to build a kernel yourself, packaged the deb files into a bare
  container
- Script allows changing bridge attachments for networking devices on-the-fly.
- YANG-first APIs and Protobuf based SDK provide modern capabilities for integration.
