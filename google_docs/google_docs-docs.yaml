auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.appsmith.com/advanced-concepts/custom-authentication:
  - The authentication uses OAuth2 with refresh token flow. Store and retrieve the
    refresh token from appsmith.store.refreshtoken, send it to your token refresh
    endpoint as a refreshtoken parameter in the request body, and update appsmith.store.accesstoken
    with the new access token from the response. If the response includes a new refresh
    token in the refreshtoken field, update appsmith.store.refreshtoken as well.
- information_source; https://docs.appsmith.com/connect-data/reference/authenticated-api:
  - Appsmith uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to obtain access tokens for authenticating
    requests to protected resources. Required parameters include Client ID (unique
    application identifier from OAuth provider), Client secret (confidential string
    from OAuth provider), and scopes (comma-separated permissions like profile, email).
    The authorization server URL is used both for initial token acquisition and refreshing
    expired tokens to maintain uninterrupted access without re-authentication.
  - Appsmith uses OAuth2 with refresh tokens to manage access token expiration and
    renewal. Key configurable parameters include token_access_type to specify short-lived
    or long-lived tokens, Authorization expires in (seconds) to set custom expiry
    duration when the OAuth provider doesn't specify it, Audience to identify the
    resource server accepting the token, and Resource to specify the protected resource
    server URL. The Send scope with refresh token parameter controls whether scopes
    are included during token refresh operations.
  - OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type with configurable credential handling for
    refresh token requests. Client credentials (client ID and client secret) can be
    sent either in the request body as form parameters or in the Authorization header
    using Basic Authentication (base64-encoded "client_id:client_secret"). The Send
    scope with refresh token setting determines whether original scopes are included
    when requesting new access tokens via refresh token, as required by some OAuth
    providers.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.appsmith.com/build-apps/how-to-guides/Server-side-pagination-in-table:
  - Offset-based pagination uses pageSize and pageNo (or pageOffset) parameters to
    fetch data. For databases, use LIMIT and OFFSET in queries with {{Table1.pageSize}}
    and {{Table1.pageOffset}}. For REST APIs, pass page as a query parameter like
    ?page={{Table1.pageNo}}. Cursor-based pagination uses previousPageVisited and
    nextPageVisited reference properties to navigate datasets by unique identifiers.
- information_source; https://docs.appsmith.com/connect-data/reference/confluence:
  - Pagination for blog post results uses `start` (offset, default 0) and `limit`
    (page size, default 25) parameters passed as an object to control batch fetching
    of results.
