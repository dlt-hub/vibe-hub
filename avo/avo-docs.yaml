auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.avohq.io/4.0/rest-api.html:
  - The API uses policy-based authorization that automatically applies the same authorization
    rules from your Avo interface. Authenticated requests are evaluated against each
    resource's policy to determine access permissions. Refer to the Authentication
    and Authorization documentation pages for details on how to authenticate requests
    and configure resource policies.
  - The API uses policy-based authorization through Pundit that automatically applies
    the same authorization rules from your Avo interface. Authorization is required
    for all requests, with 401 Unauthorized returned for unauthenticated requests.
    Access to resources and their fields is controlled by resource policies that determine
    what data each user can view or modify based on their role and permissions.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.avohq.io/4.0/rest-api.html:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: pass limit (default 25, max 100) and
    offset (default 0) as query parameters to control page size and starting position.
    The response includes total_count field indicating total records available; stop
    paginating when offset + limit >= total_count.'
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters page (default: 1) and per_page (default: from
    Avo configuration) for index endpoints only. The example shows page and per_page
    as query parameters in GET requests.'
  - Use query parameters page (default 1) and per_page (default 25) to paginate. Response
    includes pagination object with page, per_page, total_pages, total_count, has_next_page,
    and has_prev_page fields to navigate results.
