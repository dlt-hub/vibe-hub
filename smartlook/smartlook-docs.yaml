notes:
- This article is for informational purposes only.
- You must be extra cautious about sensitive personal information.
- The cookies listed are valid for 13 months and can be manually removed by clearing
  the browser cache.
- Monitoring is only valid for the specific funnel or event.
- You can filter sessions based on multiple criteria including user, source, and events.
- Segments are saved filters that can be reused.
- Smartlook can automatically detect JavaScript errors and stores then as an Error
  predefined event.
- You can view errors by searching for an Error event in your sessions or events.
- You can also view errors in the Smartlook player in the DevTools section.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in Smartlook
- Privacy first means that we do not record any potentially sensitive data by default.
- Legal requirements about personal data collection may vary across countries.
- If our proxy IP is not able to access any of the assets, the styling might not render
  correctly.
- When Smartlook's proxies make a successful CSS request to your servers, the response
  includes a special header Access-Control-Allow-Origin response with a value of *
  (wildcard).
- When you make changes in your CSS, older sessions can start to display the new style.
- If you access the page on a different date, the stylesheet may have expired.
- Smartlook has to be installed on an entirely public website so all data can be retrieved
  through a proxy to our servers.
- We process personal data to provide our services to the website provider.
- Opt-out available for being recorded by Smartlook.
- The MIT License applies to the software.
- Sessions are stored in your account for amount the time designated by the data history
  of your purchased plan.
- If you would like to keep sessions for a longer period of time, you can add them
  to the vault.
- Only web recording is currently supported.
- All variables are optional, default values are listed in the table above.
- All events are automatically tracked in Smartlook sessions.
- Sensitive data (passwords, credit card info, phone numbers, etc.) are automatically

- By default, no inputs or forms are visible in recordings.
- Sensitive inputs, like passwords, are never recorded.
- Once you enable the recording of IP addresses, you can't disable it.
- Due to GDPR, session recording of EU users is limited by default.
- In order to receive data from EU users, the project owner has to sign the Personal
  Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
- To add domains https://*.smartlook.com https://*.smartlook.cloud to script-src and
  connect-src directives.
- Whitelisting just some subdomains may still result in CSP related issues for some
  visitors.
- We recommend you not to use ‘unsafe-inline’ in any directive as it can render the
  CSP insecure.
- SSO allows members of your organization to access Smartlook using the identity provided
  by your SAML identity provider.
- When SSO is turned on, all members of your organization have to use SSO for login
  and registration purposes.
- Passwords are automatically masked and cannot be unmasked.
- Rules applied only to new sessions.
- Any changes to masking rules, new rules or list order, apply only to new sessions
  and cannot be applied to existing session recordings.
- Some Javascript frameworks include dynamically-generated CSS attributes which may
  not track correctly.
- It is recommended to use unique IDs for elements to ensure proper tracking.
- Browsers that block tracking scripts, such as Brave
- Add-ons and browser extensions that block tracking scripts, such as ad blockers
errors:
- Check your security settings and enable Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
- Your project theme could have elements that are not supported.
- You could have a firewall blocking the Smartlook proxies.
- Metadata expiration may require you to manually upload a new version if it cannot
  be renewed automatically.
