notes:
- Tasks should always be done from the Customer Portal and not from the Admin Interface.
- In some countries, telemarketing, phone polling, and automated dialing is under
  regulatory control.
- The default conference number in Freeswitch is 9888.
- An ASR section should never be the first section on survey, as the initial 'Hello'
  is recorded as well as the answer to the question you asked.
- Closed questions for ASR responses should be used, so the reply is a variation on
  yes or no.
- Some special function keywords can be imported that change the usual behaviour of
  the system.
- SMS providers may require properly formatted numbers in IETF format.
- Tag Replacement can be used to personalize messages.
- DID need to be initially configured by the Dialer Adminstrator
- DID can also be uploaded from a CSV file in the format:- did_number, user, campaign
- Check you have a green tick next to the campaign. Orange triangle means the campaign
  is not in schedule. Edit the schedule to be in date.
- If you edit a survey, then you have to create a new campaign from scratch.
- After checking the CDR to confirm calls have not been made, check your survey has
  sections in it, your phonebook has contacts, it’s in schedule to run, there are
  numbers in the appropriate timezone to call, if you are using a queue, confirm there
  are agents logged-in and available in your queue.
- Agents can log in and out using short codes.
- The adminstrator provides the agent with the link to log in as well as the username
  and password.
- Once registered, which might take a few seconds, the agent can then dial 0002 to
  do a Tone Test.
- The agent can dial 0001 for an Echo Test to check that speakers, headset and microphone
  are working as expected.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- DialerAI has always been Multi-tenant and to make it a complete solution for business,
  we recently added support for SMS & Call billing, as well as Braintree Payment Integration.
- These negative balance helpers can be adjusted in the configuration files.
- Feature switch to enable or disable payment in DialerAI UI
- SMS & Call Rates can be configured per user via the admin UI.
- With potentially hundreds or thousands of calls running concurrently, there is always
  a risk of negative balance.
- BILLING_SWITCH is useful if you don’t need billing and want to hide all the billing
  features for your users/customers.
- BILLING_CURRENCY_DISPLAY needs to display a different currency, set the symbol for
  your currency.
- Define credit needed per call in order to be authorized to dial out
- A good value for BILLING_MIN_CREDIT_DIAL is a bit above the cost per call you would
  expect
- SMS & Call Billing can be configured per user via the admin UI.
- If the customer balance runs low on credit, then SMS will not be sent and the campaign
  will stop running until credit is available.
- If the customer balance runs below the minimum credit to call, then calls will not
  be sent and the campaign will stop running until credit is applied.
- Each user needs to have Dialer Settings and gateways associated with their account.
- Dialer settings include maximum calls per minute and other limits.
- DialerAI is multi-tenant, so each user or 'Manager' can run their own campaigns
  isolated from every other manager on DialerAI.
- The dialer settings are assigned to each manager, and these control the resources
  that a manager can consume.
- VoIP / SIP gateways authenticate using IP Authentication or Digest Authentication.
- Call Center termination will be used in most cases.
- The product required from Vitelity / Ineliquent is SIP trunking.
- If Digest authentication is required, then enter a name for the gateway, the password
  and the callerID number you intend to use.
- Uses basic authentication with username and password
- 'The CallerID has 3 filters: callerid_group_id, areacode & callerid_num.'
- Agent API is read only, you cannot create Agents using this API at the moment.
- Uses basic authentication with username and password.
- 'status: 1 is for Started, now the system should start making calls.'
- DialerAI is a good choice for an outbound call center with complete flexibility
  to run anything from press-1 through to predictive dialing campaigns.
- Outbound IVR for marketing, political campaigning and market research using pre-recorded
  or synthesized voices.
