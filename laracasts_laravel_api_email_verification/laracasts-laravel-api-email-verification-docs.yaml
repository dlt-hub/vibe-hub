- Faceting provides a better user interface by allowing users to narrow down results
  based on specific categories.

- Inertia allows team members to play to their strengths.
- History encryption is a neat, underutilized feature.
- Each episode focuses on a single topic, condensed to the essentials.
- HTTP is very insecure because all of the information is transferred over the network
  as plain text.
- HTTPS encrypts the communication between the browser and the server.
- Securing HTTP with HTTPS involves several steps.
- Discusses devices essential for network functionality including switches, routers,
  and firewalls.
- Your network's bandwidth is very important because it determines how much data can
  actually flow on your network.
- Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can transfer across your network, whereas
  speed is the actual speed of that data transfer.
- SEO can be challenging because search engines historically crawl based on URLs.
- SPAs may have heavier initial load due to large JavaScript and CSS payloads.
- The API does not require authentication.
- Some steps cannot be reverted (e.g., an intro step).

- The latest stable version of composer is set up by default.

- Introduced in Laravel 11.
- Uses Context feature to capture and manage data throughout the lifecycle of a single
  request.
- Contexts are like sessions but scoped to a single request.
- They provide a centralized data store accessible throughout the application during
  that request.
- Context is an in-memory data store for request-specific data.
- Middleware is the ideal place to load data into context.
- Use context to share data like the active account and authenticated user across
  controllers, services, and views.
- Be cautious about memory usage; store only what you need.
- Contextual information is captured and shared with the job.
- Message can be added to the context as hidden data.
- Context is populated via middleware, which adds the user from the auth facade and
  the active account from the session.
- Stacks are arrays, not Laravel collections.
- Useful for tracking multiple related pieces of data during a request lifecycle.
- 'Passkeys provide a simpler and more secure alternative to traditional passwords.
  Neat, but there''s only one problem: the implementation instructions are incredibly
  complicated.'
- Shortly after this series was released, the Webauthn Framework PHP package released
  a new major version (v5), which contains a number of small breaking changes. Please
  use v4.9 of the package so that you can follow along without issues.

  the modal.
- As of recording, we're using version 4.8 of the WebAuthn library, but version 5.0
  has since been released.

  when it comes to email clients.

  of content from top developers in the Laravel space.
- Theming means changing the way the UI looks without altering the markup.
- Only certain users should have administrative powers.
- Default value for isAdmin is false.
- Using gates allows for cleaner authorization logic.
- Middleware checks if a user has a specific role before allowing access to certain
  routes.
- Checking if a user belongs to a given role can lead to multiple database queries
  within a single request.
- Creating middleware to load the user's roles into the request context improves efficiency.
- Using roles to control how users can or can't access certain parts of the application
  is very useful.
- Goal is to centralize authorization logic within the policy.
- Previously, the update method in the article policy lacked a return statement.
