  - 'The Case Management API uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow. To authenticate,
    first POST to https://api-gateway.linkhealth.com/oauth/token with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id=caseadvisor-casemanagement-prod, and client_secret (your secret value).
    The response includes an access_token with 7200 second expiration and a refresh_token.
    For API calls, embed the access token in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token}". Reuse tokens across multiple requests until near expiry
    before requesting a new token.'
- information_source; https://developer.linkhealth.com/apps/marketplace/docs/o360-clinical-interface-gateway:
  - Authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0 and transport is secured via TLS 1.2.
  - CLIaaS APIs use OAuth 2.0 with client credentials grant type. Retrieve an access
    token by sending a POST request to the token URL (https://gateway.optuminsightplatform.com/oauth/token
    for production or https://gateway-nonprod.optuminsightplatform.com/oauth/token
    for non-production) with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret
    as form-urlencoded parameters. Include the retrieved access token as a Bearer
    token in the Authorization header for all subsequent API requests.
  - Tokens are generated via OAuth2 at either https://gateway-nonprod.optuminsightplatform.com/oauth/token
    (non-prod) or https://gateway.optuminsightplatform.com/oauth/token (prod), and
    the same token should be reused for one hour across all eNLP API requests. Token
    generation is rate-limited to 25 tokens per minute. Client ID must follow the
    format enlp-coder-[Client Name] for production (e.g. enlp-coder-opas) or enlp-coder-nonprod-[Client
    Name] for non-production environments (e.g. enlp-coder-nonprod-opas). Refer to
    LINK API documentation at https://developer.linkhealth.com/api-gateway-how-to
    and https://developer.linkhealth.com/api-gateway-faq for implementation best practices.
- information_source; https://developer.linkhealth.com/apps/marketplace/docs/edi-claim-api-intake:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain a bearer token. POST to the token
    endpoint with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret in the
    request body (application/x-www-form-urlencoded). The response contains access_token,
    expires_in (3600 seconds), refresh_token, and token_type (bearer). Include the
    access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer $access_token" for API requests.
    Also include the account header with the account value. Tokens are valid for up
    to 7200 seconds; reuse tokens across multiple requests rather than requesting
    a new token per call.
