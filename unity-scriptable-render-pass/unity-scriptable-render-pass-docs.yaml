- Some objects like Asset may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Use version 6.1 or later.
- Optimize loading Adaptive Probe Volume data.
- Some configurations may require additional setup.
- Requires setup of Unity project for API access
- Requires setup of a connected app in Unity.
- Some endpoints may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Unity AI tools help create game-ready assets and assist coding workflows.
- Optimize loading Adaptive Probe Volume data
- GameObjects represent everything in your game, including characters, props, and
  scenery.
- You can design and build your environment in the Unity Editor.
- Actual performance and rendering quality might vary depending on the complexity
  of your project.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Minimum 8 GB RAM recommended for Unity Editor.
- Performance may vary based on project complexity.
- Requires setup of Unity Services for authentication.
- Some objects like GameObject may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some platforms might require you to install additional dependencies alongside the
  platform build support component.
- Installer files are provided as .pkg files on macOS and .exe files on Windows.
- Don’t save the installation files at the default location. Selecting the default
  location might result in incomplete file sets, or complete removal of the files
  you’ll need to run the setup on other computers.
- Uses Adaptive Probe Volumes for rendering
- May have performance implications based on scene complexity
- Installer command line arguments are case-sensitive.
- To install more than one version of Unity on macOS, rename the existing 'Unity'
  folder before installing another version.
- Uses Adaptive Probe Volumes in URP
- The Unity Download Assistant supports offline deployment.
- Follow steps for offline installation using the script generated by the Download
  Assistant.
- Make sure you have write access to the C:\ProgramData\Unity\config folder.
- Uses straight double quotes ("") and not curly quotes (“”).
- Ensure to use straight double quotes ("") when editing JSON files.
- For organizations that configure the web proxy with a proxy auto configuration (PAC)
  file, the HTTP keyword isn’t supported. Instead, use the PROXY keyword to specify
  a proxy that communicates over HTTP.
- For organizations that configure multiple web proxies with the same target URL,
  Unity applications will use only the first proxy discovered. If that web proxy isn’t
  reachable, Unity applications will not attempt to use any of the other web proxies.
- 'Check if the following directory exists on the client computer, and create it if
  it’s missing: Windows: C:\ProgramData\Unity\config, macOS: /Library/Application
  Support/Unity/config'
- Check if the directory in the previous step has a services-config.json file, and
  create it if it’s missing.
- Add the "enableProxyAutoconfig" key to the file and assign a value of true.
- Enable automatic proxy configuration by adding 'enableProxyAutoconfig' key to services-config.json
  file with value true.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for all API requests.
- Make sure you enable automatic proxy configuration.
- Unity’s automatic proxy configuration feature doesn’t fully support some platforms
  and environments.
- If your organization’s web proxy requires user authentication and is configured
  to accept basic authentication (username and password), you must store your credentials
  before using Unity applications.
- Unity applications will use these stored credentials when authenticating with the
  specified web proxy.
- Although these proxy server settings are now stored, you might receive prompts for
  credentials.
- Various features and settings related to XR development are covered.
- Uses automatic proxy configuration for Unity applications on macOS.
- Common scenarios for credential prompts include first-time access by built-in applications
  and Unity applications accessing Keychain.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Some enterprises use SSL inspection as part of their networking environment, to
  inspect, track, and control network traffic.
- It’s assumed that your web proxy that uses SSL inspection is already set up.
- Even with certificates trusted at the operating system level, client computers must
  be configured to enable automatic proxy configuration to make the Unity Hub trust
  the certificates.
- Adaptive Probe Volumes are used for dynamic lighting adjustments.

  Package Manager.
- The Package Manager uses it to configure many things, including a list of dependencies
  for that project.
- 'Don’t manually modify the lock file: the Package Manager creates and maintains
  the lock file, so it overwrites any changes you make to the file.'
- Put the lock file under source control so you can consistently reproduce the same
  package set to ensure your project remains consistent over time and on different
  machines.
