notes:
- Updates must represent the full state of the product description, including the
  desired order of feature bullets.
- Maximum of 100 updates per request with each update having a maximum of 25 supplier
  part numbers.
- Not all market contexts can be updated for a single supplier part.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Some cookies may vary depending on geographic regions due to privacy law considerations.
- Cookies are used for functionality, preferences, analytics, and advertising.
- Not all market contexts can be updated for a single supplier part. Wayfair restricts
  updates per product to a single market context.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Pliki cookie mogą się różnić w zależności od regionu z powodu przepisów dotyczących
  prywatności.
- Tokens are valid for 24 hours (86,400 seconds).
- Fetch a new token every 12 hours.
- Ensure that your Sandbox application has been fully tested in the sandbox environment
  before using your Production application.
- Uses Bearer Token as the Auth Type
- Wayfair’s primary form of authentication is through the O-Auth client-credentials
  workflow.
- There is no way to test the Catalog API queries and mutations within the Graphiql
  page.
- The inventory data will only be stored for 7 days from the day they were sent.
- 'The vetting page only displays feedKind: TRUE_UP feeds and ignores all feedKind:
  DIFFERENTIAL feeds.'
- Currently the supplier can only send the ACCEPT response for the PO through API.
  BACKORDER/REJECT still need to be performed through Partner Home.
- Please only grant permissions to Vendors that you already work with.
- To provide consistency across all of our API offerings, Supplier ID is a mandatory
  field for the submissions query and the remediateValidationFlaws mutation.
- There is a default limit of 60 requests per minute.
- Only the Catalog API is available.
- Rate limits on Catalog API requests at 10 requests per second
- Supplier ID is a mandatory field for submissions query and remediateValidationFlaws
  mutation effective June 26, 2024
- To ensure a product goes live, it is required to add at least one image.
- 'Supported media types include: PNG, JPEG, PDF, MP4, MOV, WMV, XLS, XLSX.'
- Default values of 10 items and 0 offset for queries.
- The manufacturer ID in the submit request must match one of the IDs returned by
  the supplier brand association query.
- Users should limit their product addition submission batches to 100 products per
  request.
- Recommended to bundle products that can be considered option combinations in one
  request.
- Each product must have at least one image for it to go live.
- We currently recommend users limit their product addition submission batches to
  100 products per request to ensure the request size remains within GraphQL's maximum
  allowed limit.
- The states VALIDATING, PROCESSING, and SUBMITTING are transitory states that should
  progress onto the next state within 10 minutes, but it can take upwards of 30 minutes.
- If options are not grouped together, suppliers can submit a ticket through Partner
  Home to request product consolidation.
- Adding products is an asynchronous process and the submit API will return a request
  ID that can be used to track the status.
- For all updates except for media updates, a market context must be provided.
- Multiple products can be bundled together in a single request to generate a single
  SKU.
- Supports supplier part level updates and supplier part group level updates.
