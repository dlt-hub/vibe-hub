auth_info:
- information_source; https://leaddesk.com/docs/get-started/:
  - 'All requests to the Original API require two common parameters for authentication:
    the auth parameter, which is a 32-character identification code provided by LeadDesk
    customer support that must be sent as a GET parameter, and the mod and cmd parameters
    that specify which module and command to execute. The auth code serves as the
    API key credential for identifying the customer.'
  - Authentication is performed via an auth query parameter containing a 32-character
    hexadecimal string. The auth value must be passed as a query parameter in the
    request URL, for example auth=11111222223333344444555556666677. If authentication
    fails, an ERR_AUTHENTICATION error is returned.
- information_source; https://leaddesk.com/docs/introduction-rest-api/:
  - API uses OAuth2 with client credentials and username. The client_user grant type
    requires POST to https://restapi-nor.leaddesk.com/stable/oauth/access-token with
    JSON body containing grant_type set to "client_user", client_id, client_secret,
    username, and leaddesk_client_id. The response includes access_token with Bearer
    token type, expires_in (3600 seconds), and refresh_token. Expired access tokens
    are refreshed via refresh_token grant type by sending the refresh_token in a POST
    request to the same endpoint; refresh tokens eventually expire if not used.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where the token is provided by the API
    service. All requests must include this header to authenticate.'
  - LeadDesk REST API uses OAuth 2 authentication with support for multiple grant
    types. The password grant type requires POST to https://restapi-nor.leaddesk.com/stable/oauth/access-token
    with content-type application/json containing grant_type set to "password", client_id,
    client_secret, username, and password fields. The response returns an access_token
    with token_type "Bearer" that should be used in subsequent requests. Use the Bearer
    token in the Authorization header for API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://leaddesk.com/docs/introduction-rest-api/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters per_page and page in GET requests. The response
    contains a collection array with paginated items, a links object with next/previous
    page URLs, and a meta object with total count information. Stop paginating when
    next link is unavailable.
