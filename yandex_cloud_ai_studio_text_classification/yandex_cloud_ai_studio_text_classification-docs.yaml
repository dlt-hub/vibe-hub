  - 'Two authentication methods are supported: IAM tokens sent as "Authorization:
    Bearer <IAM_token>" in the Authorization header, or API keys sent as "Authorization:
    Api-Key <API_key>" in the Authorization header. API keys are used when automatic
    IAM token requests are not feasible.'
- information_source; https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/storage/s3/:
  - AWS Signature Version 4 is required for authenticating requests to the Yandex
    Cloud S3 API. Generate the Authorization header by following the AWS Signature
    Version 4 signing process as documented in AWS S3 documentation, which involves
    creating a cryptographic signature using your access key and secret key.
