auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.rhythmsystems.com/knowledge/developers/api-overview:
  - The Rhythm API uses OAuth2 for authentication. First-time authorization is performed
    at a different endpoint than regular API calls (which go to https://api.rhythm.cloud).
    You must contact Rhythm Systems at help@rhythmsystems.com to have your company
    enabled for API access before you can authenticate. The documentation references
    an authorization code flow but does not provide specific details about client
    IDs, secrets, token endpoints, scopes, or header names in this excerpt.
