notes:
- Advanced event mesh for SAP Integration Suite is secure by default.
- API token must be included in the Authorization Bearer header when you make a REST
  call.
- Monitor records of user activity for security and compliance
- Public Region deployments are self-serve, so assistance from SAP is not required.
- Advanced event mesh is secure by default and event broker services are deployed
  with a secure configuration.
- Security updates are required and there are additional settings you can configure
  to further harden security.
- Direct messaging supports high-rate applications but may lose messages.
- Guaranteed messaging ensures message persistence and acknowledgment.
- Direct messaging provides reliable, but not guaranteed, delivery of messages to
  consuming clients.
- By default, direct messaging is always available to all clients that connect to
  an event broker.
- Guaranteed messaging can ensure the delivery of messages between applications, even
  in cases where the receiving application is offline or there is a failure of a piece
  of network equipment.
- Messages are delivered in the order they were published.
- Event Portal has removed access to Event Portal 1.0 effective April 3, 2025.
- Event broker service version 10.11.0 is a Preview release. You cannot upgrade your
  existing event broker services to a Preview release.
- Event broker service versions 10.6.1 and above support Integrated Kafka Bridges.
- Event broker service 10.7.0 is a Preview release.
- This release introduces increased memory requirements for event broker services
  in the Enterprise 5K service class and higher.
- You cannot upgrade your existing event broker services to a Preview release.
- For customers of advanced event mesh for SAP Integration Suite, you can open a support
  ticket under the BC-CP-EM-AEM component.
- Event meshes support geographically distributed use cases.
- You can interconnect on-premises and different cloud vendors.
- Mesh Manager always creates a full-mesh of DMR external links between the event
  broker services in your event mesh.
- An event broker service can be part of only one event mesh.
- Topic subscriptions are securely propagated only to event broker services that have
  subscribers (consumers) that are interested in the topic to minimize network traffic.
- You can connect one event broker service that has a private endpoint (private IP
  addresses) to another event broker service that is configured with public endpoint
  (public Internet) provided that the initiator is the service with the private endpoint.
- Use v2 APIs whenever possible.
- General Availability REST APIs are supported.
- The SEMP v2 API is being released iteratively. With each release, more commands
  and functionality are added.
- Security architecture is influenced by deployment options selected.
- Customer must manage security in Customer-Controlled Regions.
- Customer manages all aspects of the deployment configuration, connectivity, and
  security.
- Client usernames can either be provided by the connected client or be automatically
  generated for the client based on an LDAP or OAuth group.
- Using TLS/SSL-encrypted connections to an event broker offers confidentiality, message
  integrity, server authentication, and optional client authentication.
- Installing an ECDSA server certificate will break compatibility with older versions
  of the Solace Messaging APIs and event broker versions that do not support TLS 1.3.
  Ensure you update all your event broker instances and client applications to support
  TLS 1.3 before proceeding.
- All data is secure and encrypted while stationary or in transit.
- Data sovereignty refers to the laws and governance that the collection and storage
  of data adheres to.
- The same logs are used by Insights, which permits you to monitor the health of your
  event broker services in your account.
- For management client applications, ensure that the API tokens are assigned the
  minimal, but necessary permissions for the client application to perform its tasks.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Messaging Connectivity refers to the way messaging clients access the event broker
  services.
- Management Connectivity is required so that you can administer your event broker
  services.
- Operational Connectivity refers to the network access you need to set up your Kubernetes
  cluster and launch event broker services.
- Hostnames must be alphanumeric characters (including dashes) and cannot be longer
  than 255 characters.
- A hostname must be globally unique within the domain.
- You are responsible for migrating any required event broker service settings when
  you move a hostname.
- You can't move a hostname that is set as Default.
- Deleting a hostname impacts the connectivity of clients that use the deleted hostname.
- You can configure both public and private endpoints on the same event broker service.
- Custom hostnames are recommended for endpoints of your event broker service.
- Basic authentication is the default client authentication scheme for advanced event
  mesh event broker services.
- Client profiles define a set of client behaviors and capabilities that you can apply
  to multiple client usernames or LDAP authorization groups.
- You must have Mission Control Manager permissions for the event broker service to
  create, modify, or delete client profiles.
- Client access to resources and messaging capabilities on an event broker can be
  provisioned through client usernames.
- SEMP v1 uses XML schema for managing and monitoring event brokers.
- Applications can optionally create secure connections using TLS/SSL.
- When a SEMP v1 request would result in an oversized response, the event broker responds
  with a failure with reasonCode="431" and reason="response too big".
- Uses standard HTTP methods for resource manipulation
- Authentication is required for all requests.
- Every SEMP request requires a scope and access level determined in accordance with
  the following rules.
- User Management includes functionality for adding and deleting users and controlling
  user activity through role assignments.
- Roles provide sets of permissions to users that can be assigned manually or dynamically
  using group management.
- Rate Limiting is not provided with the SEMP API. We recommend managing the frequency
  of requests you send.
- Transactions are not supported directly, but individual requests either complete
  successfully or not at all.
- Sorting query results is not supported.
- Paging is supported for the GET method when retrieving collections.
