auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.revelator.com/changelog/:
  - The documentation mentions that the `/partner/users` endpoint requires a `partnerApiKey`
    parameter for authentication on this administrative endpoint. Pass the `partnerApiKey`
    as a required parameter when making requests to this endpoint for user management
    operations.
- information_source; https://api-docs.revelator.com/:
  - API key authentication via the Authorization header. The partnerApiKey must be
    a UUID in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. Additionally, the partnerAPIKey
    parameter is required in request bodies for user management endpoints. An incorrectly
    formatted UUID will result in a 500 error with a specific validation message.
  - Authentication uses a login endpoint that requires partnerUserId and partnerApiKey
    credentials sent in the request body as JSON. The login response returns an accessToken
    that should be used for subsequent authenticated requests, along with permissions
    data indicating the user's access level across various resources.
  - 'POST `/partner/account/login` requires two types of credentials in the JSON request
    body: `partnerApiKey` (always required, provided during onboarding) and either
    `partnerUserId` (for unprompted login) or `username`/`password` pair (for prompted
    login), but never both simultaneously. The endpoint returns an accessToken upon
    successful authentication.'
  - Pass the partner API key in the request body as the `partnerAPIKey` parameter
    (a UUID string provided during onboarding) to authenticate requests. The `partnerUserId`
    parameter is also required in the signup request body for authentication purposes.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.revelator.com/en/catalog-management:
  - Pagination uses `pageNumber` (optional, default 1) and `pageSize` (optional, system-defined
    default) query parameters. `pageNumber` is required for `pageSize` to work properly.
    The response structure for indicating total pages or next page availability is
    not documented in the provided excerpt.
  - Pagination uses `pageNumber` (query parameter, required, starts at 1) and `pageSize`
    (query parameter, required) request parameters. Response includes `totalItemsCount`,
    `pageNumber`, and `pageSize` fields. Iterate by incrementing `pageNumber` until
    all items are retrieved based on `totalItemsCount`.
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNumber (optional, default 1) and pageSize
    (optional) to request pages. The response structure for pagination fields is not
    documented in the provided text.
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNumber (required, starting at 1) and pageSize
    (required, default 10) to request pages. The response includes totalItemsCount,
    pageNumber, pageSize, and items array. Stop paginating when the number of items
    returned is less than pageSize or when pageNumber times pageSize exceeds totalItemsCount.
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNumber and pageSize in the request, with
    response fields totalItemsCount, pageNumber, pageSize, and items array. Stop paginating
    when the items array is empty or when pageNumber times pageSize reaches totalItemsCount.
