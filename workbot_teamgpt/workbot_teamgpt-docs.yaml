auth_info:
- information_source; https://workhubworkbot.docs.apiary.io/:
  - Access token and company uuid are required. The access token must be obtained
    by calling the WorkBot admin API `/api/auth` endpoint. The company uuid is passed
    as a query parameter named `uuid`. The access token should be sent in request
    headers (specific header name not explicitly stated in this documentation chunk,
    but implied to be a standard Authorization header based on typical API patterns).
