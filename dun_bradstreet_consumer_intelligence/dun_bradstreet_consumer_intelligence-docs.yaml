  : - The Consumer Intelligence API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for authentication.
      You must exchange your client API credentials for a short-lived access token
      and include this token in all API requests. To obtain an access token, send
      your client_id and client_secret to the token endpoint. Include the access token
      in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent API calls. Access
      tokens are short-lived and can be refreshed using the refresh token or by obtaining
      a new token with your credentials.
- information_source; https://api.bisnode.com/consumer-intelligence-documentation/v3/index.html:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include your access_token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}". Access to specific markets
    and operations (e.g., Onboarding, Monitoring) depends on client permissions granted
    for those markets.'
  - OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. Call the D&B OAuth endpoint at https://login.bisnode.com/sandbox/v1/token.oauth2
    with POST, sending grant_type=client_credentials and scope=bci in the request
    body, authenticated via HTTP Basic Auth using client_id and client_secret. The
    response contains an access_token with token_type bearer and expires_in 3600 seconds.
    Use the access_token in subsequent API requests.
