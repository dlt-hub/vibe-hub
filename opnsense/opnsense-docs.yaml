notes:
- We do not offer community support on assessing if incidents on older versions do
  warrant an immediate upgrade on your end as this often depends on features used
  and settings configured.
- Using DNS for endpoints is possible, but will work a bit different than previously
  as in most cases the firewall tried to resolve the names and didn’t use the functionality
  provided by Strongswan.
- It is however currently not possible to use DNS entries for VTI tunnels due to restrictions
  in if_ipsec(4) as these type of interfaces can’t be changed dynamically in a reliable
  way.
- Using DNS for endpoints is possible, but will work a bit different than previously.
- Without a policy in place for the tunnel, traffic won’t be accepted.
- OpenVPN is easier to configure compared to IPsec, with fewer settings involved.
- The default port for OpenVPN is 1194 using protocol UDP.
- We advise to include the output of the health check if it seems to report issues
  when creating bug reports on GitHub.
- Always try to be precise in issue reports, either if their about a possible bug
  or a feature request, it helps if intentions are absolutely clear.
- OPNsense is licensed under an Open Source Initiative approved license
- Modularising and hardening the open source firewall
- Performance enhancements especially for numerous aliases being used at once
- Deprecated Google Drive backups due to upstream policy changes and moved to plugins
  for existing users.
- API URLs registered in the default ACLs have been switched from 'camelCase' to 'snake_case'.
- API grid return values now offer '%field' for a value description when available.
  'field' will now always be the literal value from the configuration. The API previously
  returned a display value for some field types, but not all.
- Reverted tunables 'hw.ibrs_disable' and 'vm.pmap.pti' to FreeBSD defaults.
- The new wizard still has bugs relating to disabling LAN configuration.
- Dnsmasq DHCP is here and now it is going to be even better with multiple fixes thanks
  to the swift feedback we received.
- We are aware of the complex topic of DHCP in the recent years so keep in mind we
  added Dnsmasq to fill a specific need for smaller installations that other services
  cannot offer.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The access management was rewritten in MVC and contains behavioural changes including
  not rendering UNIX accounts for non-shell users.
- Let’s Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance
  requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.
- New dashboard features and MVC/API support
- Upgrade path from 24.1.x to 24.7.x
- A hotfix release was issued as 24.7.4_1
- This update also ships the first backwards-compatible PPP rework patch.
- The dashboard has been replaced. Widgets from the old format are no longer supported
  and need to be rewritten by the respective authors.
- ISC DHCP will no longer reload DNS services on static mapping edits. This is for
  feature parity with Kea DHCP and avoiding cross-service complications. If you expect
  your static mappings to show up in a particular DNS service please restart this
  service manually.
- Not meant for production use but all plugins are provided and future updates of
  installations based on these images will be possible.
- For more than 9 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising and
  hardening the open source firewall.
- 24.1, nicknamed “Savvy Shark”, features ports-based OpenSSL 3, Suricata 7.
- Audits and certifications are requiring us to restrict system accounts for non-administrators.
- ISC DHCP functionality is slowly being deprecated with the introduction of Kea as
  an alternative.
- The move to the FreeBSD ports version of OpenSSL 3.0 is included and may disrupt
  third party repository use.
- Audits and certifications are requiring us to restrict system accounts for non-administrators
  (without wheel group in particular). It will no longer be able to use non-adminstrator
  accounts with shell access and permissions for sensitive files have been tightened
  to not be world-readable. This may cause custom tooling to stop working, but can
  easily be fixed by giving these required accounts the full administration rights.
- ISC DHCP functionality is slowly being deprecated with the introduction of Kea as
  an alternative. The work to replace the tooling of ISC DHCP is ongoing, but feature
  sets will likely differ for a long time therefore.
- The move to the FreeBSD ports version of OpenSSL 3.0 is included and may disrupt
  third party repository use until those have been fixed and rebuilt accordingly.
  Please note that we do not vet third party repositories and do not have control
  over them so their response time may vary.
- The Squid web proxy functionality moves to a plugin and will no longer be installed
  by default for new installations. However, if you have Squid enabled the plugin
  will automatically be installed during the upgrade. There is no code difference
  in the implementation and integration of the plugin compared to the core version.
- 23.7, nicknamed “Restless Roadrunner”, features numerous MVC/API conversions including
  the new OpenVPN “instances” configuration option.
- OpenVPN does no longer support the XOR feature.
- The roadmap for 23.7 was published, mainly consisting of MVC/API porting efforts.
- The LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued. Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed
  with the upgrade.
- StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the
  deprecated ipsec.conf.
- LibreSSL flavour is scheduled for removal at the end of this series and will likely
  receive no further maintenance.
- Pick up the new FreeBSD security advisories while also introducing assorted reliability
  improvements.
- Wireless handling was improved due to PHP 8 errors and coding style issues.
- The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now
  fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.
- The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid
  future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.
- Major operating system changes bear risk for regression and feature removal.
- Make sure to read the known issues and limitations before attempting to upgrade.
- This release contains a new major operating system version and should be carried
  out with the necessary care. Despite extended test coverage changes made by FreeBSD
  may still affect operation without our knowledge. Except for ZFS boot environments
  rollbacks between major operating system versions are extremely fragile and a reinstall
  of an older version should be attempted in the worst case. For more information
  please consult the FreeBSD 13.0 release notes.
- IPsec hash and cipher removals in FreeBSD 13 can affect existing setups as insecure
  cryptographic options have been removed upstream. If you are using MD5, Blowfish,
  DES, 3DES, or CAST128 in your phase 2 please move to more secure settings prior
  to the upgrade. Note that phase 1 settings are unaffected, but insecure settings
  should still be avoided.
- The Realtek vendor driver is no longer bundled with the updated FreeBSD kernel.
  If unsure whether FreeBSD 13 supports your Realtek NIC please install the os-realtek-re
  plugin prior to upgrading to retain operability of your NICs.
- MAC spoofing now only pertains to the configured interface and not the VLAN siblings
  or parent interface. This can introduce unwanted configuration due to previous side
  effects in the code. Make sure to assign and set the spoofed MAC for all interfaces
  that require a spoofed MAC or simply spoof the MAC on the parent and leave the VLAN
  sibling settings empty to let them follow the parent MAC automatically. If in doubt
  the parent interface can be set into promiscuous mode now to allow for mixed MAC
  address use across VLANs too.
- Media and hardware offload settings are no longer shown for non-parent interfaces
  and need to be set individually on the parent interface to take effect. This can
  introduce unwanted configuration due to previous side effects in the code. If the
  parent interface was not previously assigned please assign it to reapply the required
  settings.
- NTPD defaults changed to exclude the “iburst” option by default. “limited” setting
  was detached from “kod” option. In both cases configuration adjustments can achieve
  previous behaviour if required.
- Rebind checks through os-dyndns or os-rfc2136 will no longer work due to the deprecation
  of both plugins. Please add your rebind hosts manually or disable rebind protection
  prior to the upgrade.
- GRE link1 support has been removed and needs a static route to function now.
- Circular logging support has been removed. No user interaction is required.
- The beta version will always be available for upgrade when switching to the development
  version.
- No stable packages are provided and this includes plugins.
- The Let’s Encrypt client plugin is now called ACME client since acme.sh version
  3 does support multiple providers.
- RSS (receive side scaling) is progressing and groundwork has already made it to
  the kernel.
- NextCloud backup feature moved from core to plugins. Please reinstall if needed.
- IPsec identities are now set using their explicit type. See StrongSwan documentation
  for the old automatic defaults.
- Unbound custom options setting has been discontinued. Local override directory /usr/local/etc/unbound.opnsense.d
  exists.
- For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and receives
  continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike.
- As we continue to deprecate custom configuration inputs for a number of reasons,
  Dnsmasq has been switched to a pluggable file-based approach with Unbound to follow
  in the upcoming 21.7 series.
- API incompatibilities with existing external tools.
- Installer currently advertises 20.7
- This release adds DHCPv6 multi-WAN, custom error pages for the web proxy, Suricata
  5, HardenedBSD 12.1, netstat tree view, basic firewall API support (via plugin)
  and extended live log filtering amongst others.
- legacy MPD plugins os-l2tp, os-pppoe and os-pptp are no longer available
- i386 architecture builds are no longer available
- Legacy MPD plugins os-l2tp, os-pppoe and os-pptp will no longer be available
- i386 architecture builds will no longer be available
- Installer still advertises 20.1
- This release adds VXLAN and additional loopback device support, IPsec public key
  authentication and elliptic curve TLS certificate creation amongst others.
- HardenedBSD 12.1 has been postponed to the next major release
- Nano growfs does not work on this release candidate, but a fix for 20.1 already
  exists
- Installer still advertises 19.7, but a fix for 20.1 already exists
- Legacy MPD plugins os-l2tp, os-pppoe and os-pptp have been deprecated and will no
  longer receive updates
- 'Web proxy squid update from version 3 to 4 breaks the cache database. To repair
  go to ''Services: Web Proxy: Administration'' tab ''Support'' and click ''Reset''.'
- OpenVPN no longer supports listening on gateway groups. Use localhost paired with
  port forwards instead.
- The firewall alias API is finally in place.
- 2FA now works with a remote LDAP / local TOTP combination.
- This is a smaller stable update consisting of LDAPS authentication server improvements,
  Unbound host overrides alias support, OpenSSL 1.0.2r security update and the recent
  PAM rework for better privilege separation.
- The 19.1 release, nicknamed “Inspiring Iguana”, consists of a total of 620 individual
  changes since 18.7 came out 6 months ago, spread out over 12 intermediate releases
  including the recent release candidates.
- Gateway health graphs may need a manual reset due to the Apinger to Dpinger migration.
- Intrusion detection GeoIP rules are automatically deactivated and need to be manually
  migrated to firewall alias GeoIP.
- 'Monit general settings do not save. A patch exists to remedy this problem: opnsense-patch
  a2899594.'
- Issue with IDS migration code creating a spurious crash report. Patch already done
  for the final 19.1.
- Quagga plugin has been superseded by FRR plugin. A binary quagga package has been
  conserved for the time being.
- Please read the FRR documentation with regard to the required system tunables.
- SNMP plugin has been superseded by Net-SNMP plugin.
- ZFS guided installation pending.
- QinQ is no longer included in this release.
- ZFS on root boot support (installer support is pending, but opnsense-bootstrap works).
- This stable update finally brings you the promised LDAP+TOTP authentication.
- The firewall alias API has been finished in the development version.
- This update is going forward with a larger batch of firmware update improvements
  that are important for 18.7 and beyond.
- Intrusion detection syslog behaviour changes slightly after a number of good discussions.
- For more than 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising and
  hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware upgrades,
  multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of upstream software
  updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.
- Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD, but there
  is no reliable timeline.
- The firewall NAT rule generation rewrite is not yet fully verified.
- The web GUI recovery is not yet fully implemented.
- This update includes a larger number of security-related updates in third party
  software recently published.
- We do recommend a reboot to ensure all services are restarted correctly.
- Only OpenSSL is provided at this point, but can be switched for LibreSSL as soon
  as the release is available.
- The process will download a full set of updates and reboot multiple times.
- For fresh installations images are provided with OpenSSL for 32 and 64 bit Intel
  architectures.
- The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard FreeBSD 11.0. The
  impact on 6rd setups is currently unknown.
- Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBDS 11.0 could still affect operability.
- Insight and Health statistics import from the early installer may not work.
- Due to a Python 2.7.13 incompatibility the NetFlow connector may not work. A workaround
  is to revert to the Python 2.7.12 release.
- The LibreSSL version will not be available until the final release.
- 'The console settings received a non-backwards compatible change. If the VGA console
  is not working, simply reconfigure it from System: Settings: Administration as it
  was likely set to Serial due to a wrong GUI default.'
- An incompatibility in Chrome may prevent the firmware update from running. Try a
  different browser to upgrade.
- A reboot is not strictly necessary, but recommended.
- 'Attention: An incompatibility in Chrome may prevent the firmware update from running.'
- No known authentication required for API access.
- Can now update from any available FreeBSD 10 release
- Added user-defined rules for adding and enforcing their own fingerprints
- IP geolocation feature was added
- The installer’s import configuration tool coupled with a quick and easy installation
  can help you move from OpenSSL to LibreSSL and back seamlessly.
- Security-wise, it has been rather quiet with only a few CVEs in third-party tools.
- Added API key authentication mechanism.
- AES-NI is now supported by both LibreSSL and OpenSSL.
- The new captive portal can already be tested and will receive more features as we
  near version 16.1.
- This is a simple upgrade from 15.1.12 which we recommend to everyone.
- The biggest addition is the intrusion detection integration (suricata) as well as
  new local and remote blacklists options for the proxy server (squid).
- You can disable certificate validation if using a self-signed certificate.
- Only add the Firewall Nodes to the Central Host. Do not add the Central Host to
  itself to prevent configuration loops.
- Make sure the browser trusts the connection to the Central Host.
- Make sure port 443 isn’t being used for the web gui of this firewall.
- When using Let’s Encrypt, the Web Application Firewall uses the tls-alpn-01 challenge
  type for easy domain verification.
- Increasing the Body limits will increase the log file sizes, and will eventually
  use the disk of the OPNsense to write files upon inspection.
- If many different file extensions are hosted on the WebDAV server, some of these
  will be blocked by default rules.
- Regular blocklists, if configured, are still active and may cause policy conflicts.
- Users can manage their passwords and OTP tokens through the portal.
- Access to the portal can be restricted based on user groups.
- The private keys of root and intermediate CAs are not required.
- The hardware setup requires careful preparation and selection of standard PC hardware
  components.
- OPNsense is available for x86-64 (amd64) bit microprocessor architectures.
- Default credentials after a fresh install are username 'root' and password 'opnsense'.
- In case of a minimum install setup, OPNsense can be run with all standard features,
  except for the ones that require disk writes.
- 'Console access is restricted with a login. Use user: root and password: opnsense.'
- 'Web interface access requires user: root and password: opnsense.'
- 'The default configured settings in OPNsense for proper serial connectivity in System->Settings->Administration
  are as followed: Primary Console: Serial Console, Secondary Console: None, Serial
  Speed: 115200, USB-based serial: (unchecked), Console menu: (checked).'
- 'Warning: This firmware is exclusive to the DEC600 and DEC2600 2.5 Gigabit series
  of the A8 version 2 boards. Do not install this firmware on older DEC600/DEC2600
  devices that only support 1 Gigabit Ethernet.'
- 'Attention: The DEC600 and DEC2600 series (2.5GbE) use an image file that must be
  written to a USB drive.'
- RJ45 SFP+ modules (10GBASE-T) can run at high operating temperatures in comparison
  to Fiber or DAC modules.
- If the ambient temperature does not exceed 50°C, RJ45 SFP+ modules can be used in
  all OPNsense® appliances without issue.
- Most transceiver modules are available for purchase with a variety of different
  programming options for compatibility with different vendors.
- Unless specified otherwise, all modules are assumed to have the generic / MSA standard
  default programming.
- The dashboard configuration is saved per user.
- 'Warning: Before reverting a kernel please consult the forums or open an issue via
  Github. You should only revert kernels on test machines or when qualified team members
  advise you to do so.'
- Insight requires configuration of the Netflow exporter for local capturing.
- When using external authentication services (such as ldap), the firewall needs a
  route to the configured target machine in order to function properly.
- Make sure the certificate authority of the remote server is configured in the System
  -> Trust section.
- When using SSL/TLS, ensure proper configuration.
- RADIUS does not support a *memberOf* group concept by design.
- Use the tester under System ‣ Access ‣ Tester to test the Radius server.
- Two-factor authentication requires two components, such as a pin/password + a token.
- OPNsense supports RFC 6238 for Time-based One-time Password.
- Upgrading to OPNsense BE is only possible when the installed community version number
  is lower than the last available business edition.
- Automatically generated gateways usually have names like 'WAN_DHCP'.
- There can only be one default at a time per IP protocol (ipv4, ipv6) in the system
  routing table.
- When debugging dynamic gateway issues, always check if your expected gateway is
  actually in the list.
- Currently it’s not possible to use gateways without an address (Interface option
  “Dynamic gateway policy”) inside a group.
- By default, these services listen on all addresses (interfaces).
- Misconfigurations likely lead to a non-accessible web interface and/or missing ssh
  access.
- Snapshots require ZFS as filesystem. UFS will not work since it does not support
  file system level snapshots.
- Each Snapshot can be created and deleted as its own self-contained entity with no
  other dependencies.
- Legacy compatibility WAN interfaces set to type DHCP can break connectivity in some
  rare scenarios.
- Entries defined here do contain options for Ether Address, IP address, and Description.
- IPv6 has long been shipped as a default option in OPNsense and received gradual
  improvements over the years.
- This guide aims to provide groundwork for how IPv6 can be configured and how to
  spot known mistakes and troubleshoot connectivity.
- Uses HTTPS for secure authentication.
- The Captive Portal API is only supported on IPv4.
- Make sure to connect the antenna to the cellular modem once you start configuring
  the modem in OPNsense.
- Some Sierra Wireless modems still seem to need a specific init string to work properly.
- Aliases can be added, modified and removed via Firewall ‣ Aliases.
- The fields above are only used for aliases that contain either networks or hosts,
  port type aliases are part of the rule and thus not visible in any table.
- Adding aliases using /api/firewall/alias_util/add/ is only supported for Host, Network
  and External type aliases.
- For multiwan setups be careful with groups. Since groups are not bound to a specific
  interface, they will use the normal routing system to determine the next hop when
  applied on WAN type interfaces (`reply-to` is not used here).
- 'Rules can be set to three different action types: Pass, Block, Reject.'
- Traffic can be matched on incoming or outgoing direction.
- Rules are processed in sequence per section.
- Traffic shaping is flexible and organized around pipes, queues, and rules.
- Bandwidth limitations can be defined based upon interfaces, IP source & destination,
  direction of traffic, and port numbers.
- Traffic normalization protects internal machines against inconsistencies in Internet
  protocols and implementations.
- Ensure interface assignments on both systems are identical.
- Always create Carp VIPs with the same subnet mask as its parent interface.
- All IPv6 CARP VIPs on LAN interfaces should be `/64` Link Local Addresses.
- Don’t use Global Unicast Addresses, many devices ignore them as IPv6 Gateway.
- Dnsmasq is a lightweight and easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
- It is considered the replacement for ISC-DHCP in small and medium sized setups.
- DHCPv6 does not have a router option like DHCPv4.
- With ra-stateless, clients will only generate a SLAAC address.
- Reservations will reserve the IP address inside a range, meaning the reserved IP
  will not be offered to dynamic clients.
- Setting the range mode to static is not required for reservations. It is for specific
  usecases where a range should not serve any unknown dynamic clients.
- A Hardware address will not work for IPv6 reservations. It must be the device unique
  identifier (DUID). This example uses the common DUID-LL type.
- This combines both IPv4 and IPv6 reservations in the same configuration item.
- Now both master and backup have their own pool in the LAN network. The pool on master
  is larger, since it will respond to most DHCP discovers.
- Reservations for single hosts created in Services ‣ Dnsmasq DNS & DHCP ‣ Host Override
  can still be synchronized.
- ISC DHCP is end-of-life and no longer receives updates or security patches.
- It is strongly recommended to migrate to KEA or Dnsmasq.
- It is recommended to use the offered default value for server name.
- All configuration must be done on the master, and afterwards synchronized to the
  backup.
- A minimum amount of settings is needed in order to register with OpenDNS.
- Default behavior is to respond to queries on every available IPv4 and IPv6 address.
- The OISD lists are wildcard lists. Meaning that they will block all subdomains of
  the listed domains.
- Easy Access is Key to Collaboration
- 'Although this is just a peek into OPNsense development workflow it brings to attention
  a key aspect: moving barriers out of the way to enable as many people as possible
  to produce quick results.'
