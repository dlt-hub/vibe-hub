auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.proca.app/readme.html:
  - Authentication using HTTP Basic Auth or JWT (to use external identity and auth
    system). HTTP Basic Auth requires username and password credentials sent in the
    Authorization header as base64-encoded "username:password". JWT authentication
    allows using external identity providers and requires a JWT token sent in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {token}".
- information_source; https://docs.proca.app/api.html:
  - 'Proca Server API uses the Authorization header for authentication with three
    supported methods: HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded email and password, API
    tokens generated via resetApiToken mutation sent as "Authorization: Bearer API-XXXXXXX",
    or JWT tokens if configured. All operations run in either anonymous or authenticated
    user context, optionally scoped to an organisation.'
  - 'Proca Server supports two authentication methods: API tokens generated via the
    resetApiToken mutation, sent as Authorization Bearer API-XXXXXXX header; and JWT
    tokens (from Zero Trust Proxy or GoTrue/Supabase), sent as Authorization Bearer
    eyJWT-token-... header. Additionally, HTTP Basic Auth is supported using email
    as username and password credentials.'
