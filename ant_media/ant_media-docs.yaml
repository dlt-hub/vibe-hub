pagination_info:
- information_source; https://antmedia.io/rest/2.16.0/swagger.json:
  - Offset-based pagination is used for the filters list endpoint. The offset parameter
    (path, required, integer) specifies the starting position, and the size parameter
    (path, required, integer) specifies the number of items to fetch. If fewer items
    exist than requested, the returned list may be smaller than the size value.
