auth_info:
- information_source; https://find-and-use-an-api.education.gov.uk/documentation/tutorials:
  - OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is used. Users are redirected to a login endpoint
    with client_id, redirect_uri, scope, audience, and state parameters. After user
    authorization, an authorization code is returned as a query parameter, which is
    then exchanged for an access_token and refresh_token by making a POST request
    to the token endpoint with grant_type set to "authorisation_code", along with
    code, client_id, client_secret, and redirect_url as form parameters. The response
    contains access_token and refresh_token fields.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. For user-restricted endpoints, use
    the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header with your subscription key value. For application-restricted
    endpoints, use OAuth 2.0 with client credentials grant type: POST to the token
    endpoint with grant_type set to "client_credentials", client_id, and client_secret
    as form parameters to obtain an access_token and refresh_token from the response.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.education.gov.uk/statistics/docs/overview/pagination/:
  - Paginated responses contain a paging object with page, pageSize, totalPages, and
    totalResults fields. Request the next page by providing a page query parameter
    in the URL. Stop paginating when the current page number reaches totalPages.
  - Use `page` query parameter to specify the page number (e.g., `?page=2`). Optionally
    use `pageSize` query parameter to control results per page (e.g., `?pageSize=5`),
    though availability and limits vary. Response headers `Page`, `Page-Size`, `Total-Results`,
    and `Total-Pages` provide pagination metadata when body embedding is unavailable.
