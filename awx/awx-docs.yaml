notes:
- Continue using RH’s tooling on a temporary basis to generate the artifacts from
  source code.
- Put the artifacts in an existing s3 bucket with public read access.
- Topic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.
- Need help? This is the place! Get started with Ansible, debug your playbooks, set
  up your tooling … whatever your question, ask it here!
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Automation powered by community
- This website uses cookies to function.
- Handlers are not executed when play has different tag.
- if using a version older than ansible-core 2.12 you should omit the '-t all'
- Defining a play tag prevents role handlers from executing.
- In ansible 2.19, defining a play tag prevents role handlers from executing.
- This works well in ansible 2.18 (and before) and also when there are no play tags
  defined.
- 'The Collection Lives On: Don’t worry, the cisco.asa collection will remain available
  on GitHub. We’re not deleting it!'
- 'Change in Maintenance: Red Hat will no longer provide updates, bug fixes, or support.
  The future development and health of the collection will depend on the efforts of
  community maintainers.'
- 'Ansible has 3 scopes: extra vars, play object, host'
- Public event open to all interested in Ansible.
- Welcome to the Ansible Forum!
- Event details may change leading up to date.

- Ansible modules could manage z/OS hosts so long as users understood how to navigate
  the encoding limitations.
- The upcoming enhancements in ansible-core 2.20 show how deeply our team is committed
  to improving the experience for the community.
- Event will take place on Thursday 9th October at Tobacco Dock, London, E1W 2SF,
  United Kingdom.
- Some Free / Open Source projects have AI policies.
- This document discusses the potential adoption of an AI policy for the Ansible project.
- All code must be GPLv3 compatible
- Defaults to BSD-2-Clause (more permissive)
- Only recommend libraries compatible with these licenses
- Always verify any new dependencies or suggested libraries are license-compatible
- Ask about licensing compatibility rather than assuming
- AWX writes out the extra vars file in YAML format for consumption by ansible-playbook
- YAML has a timestamp type, and your ISO8601 formatted string matches the regex used
  by YAML to parse it into this timestamp format.
- To bulk add hosts, use the /api/v2/bulk/host_create/ endpoint with a JSON payload.
- Authentication can be done using basic auth with admin credentials.
- 'Pod status (ready): awx-operator 2/2, postgres 1/1, awx-task 4/4, awx-web 2/3'
- When I run a debug for awx-web container, I can see that permissions to /etc/passwd
  are set 644.
- The `pixi.toml` work like a light dockerfile with all the controller dependencies
  pinned in the `pixi.lock` file.
- The tool can install conda/pip packages into a in-repo conda env.
- Open to all, drop in using in our online meeting
- Latest topics tagged virtual-event
- The security of an Ansible Vault encrypted file (or string) depends very much on
  the strength of the password. If you’re using short / simple passwords, or passwords
  that can easily be found by dictionary attacks, then Vault is not exactly safe.
- If you’re using strong passwords (preferably long, randomly generated ones), then
  it is safe. Ensure that the Git repo has access restrictions to limit access to
  the least necessary number of persons.
- Ensure that the Ansible Vault is properly configured before use.
- Each user gets their own logs dir?
- Only have a single account that runs playbooks?
- Remove logging from the config and specify location instead within a playbook?
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This is the Sandbox category - write what you like here, it’s excluded from search,
  scoring, etc. We’ll periodically clean up old topics, so expect things to get deleted.
- This is a parent category for all the automated systems used by the Ansible Community
  that post to the forum. No one can post in this parent category, see the sub-categories
  for more details.
- Welcome to the new Ansible Community Forum
- Forum and mailing lists will co-exist, but focus is on the forum for discussions.
- Jobs run in separate pods, and only a copy of the job’s private data dir is passed
  in.
- You cannot rely on referencing local files that are present on the control node.
- The Ansible Google Groups are now readonly.
- You can still use email to interact with the forum too - we have a guide available
  for doing that.
- 'certificate: the specified credentials were rejected by the server'
- timeout waiting for last boot time
- You can set the variables to define login details in the group definition.
- Using paramiko as the engine for ssh connection may cause the process to hang indefinitely.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Ensure to validate certificates.
- Ensure the shell script has the correct permissions and shebang.
- Scripts may need to be referenced with their full paths.
- Ensure scripts have the correct shebang for execution.
- remote_user is the 'user you log in as' on the remote, mostly used by ssh and similar
  connection plugins
- When using sudo (substitute user do) 'the current user' (normally remote/login in
  user) BECOMES the 'substitute user' to run a command(s), that is what become_user
  allows you to specify.
- 'SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain.'
- 'In AAP there is this parameter: EXTRA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: { “GIT_SSL_CAINFO”:
  “/etc/custom-ca/bundle-ca.crt” }'
- Persistent fact caching should be set and configured in ansible.cfg or env vars.
- The user wants this to happen for a specific play(book), not always.
- Starting with Python 3.10, with the default configuration ("--with-ssl-default-suites=python"),
  Python not only enforces its own cipher list but also requires TLS1.2 as a minimal
  protocol version.
- The Debian team applied some local patches to the upstream python distribution to
  make it work.
- Force ansible.builtin.uri to use minimum TLS version
- 'The name: param is for the virtual machine and hostname: under customization: is
  for setting the hostname.'
- Vault token with 8 days of TTL can be renewed before expire.
- The uri module doesn't upload binary files correctly.
- When trying to run 2 plays, if first one hit block rescue, the second play won't
  execute.
- We released a new version of ansible.netcommon v8.0.1 that handles enhances direct
  execution with ansible-core 2.19+
- the changes in netcommon requires a set of major Platform releases. That bumps the
  dependent netcommon version in all the platform collections.

- AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top
  of Ansible.
- Uses SSL for secure communication
- 'Set validate_certs: false if behind a proxy'
- Can you first please update your AWX all the way from 11.2 -->12->->14->15->16->17
- Uses localhost for execution — no SSH is used for accessing other instances
- Backup jobs run fine from command line, typically execute within 2 - 15 minutes
- Using module file /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/setup.ps1
- Using module file /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_updates.ps1
- Pipelining is enabled.
- This is probably a network issue and apt-get is stuck, since ansible is waiting
  for apt-get, ansible is stuck.
- Variables registered in one role can be accessed in another role using hostvars.
- Registered variables are available in the global scope within the same play.
- Once you register a variable it should be available for the rest of the run.
- A registered variable becomes a fact, so it’s available in hostvars and accessible
  even outside of the play.
- It does not survive between playbook runs — that’s something we’re going to be working
  on (caching facts) as an option.
- 'The variable defined in the ''hosts: all'' part cannot be seen in the next ''hosts''
  blocks.'
- Variables registered in one play may not carry over to subsequent plays.
- Filtering on variables with --variables argument may not return expected results.
- Check overwrite variables and update on project update in source configuration.
- enabled 'ask_variables_on_launch' for a template to fix the issue
- The type of work you're looking to do is best handled by writing a Cloudera module.
- Interacting with a large API for complex tasks is not ideal using a playbook.
- Create a general purpose http client URI/URL module for ansible
- Allows ansible to interact with web services
- Need to execute a module or a playbook which returns a list of services running
  on servers.
- 'Use connection: local in your task to run the module locally on the Ansible control
  host.'
- Ultimately was able to fix this by setting jinja2_native = true in the ansible.cfg
  file. Note that this will cause some weirdness with other data types, especially
  null/None/undefined vars.
- This site uses cookies in a narrow way, as explained by this Discourse software
  site post.
- Some devices may fail to update primary IP.
- The ansible_interfaces fact lists all of the existing network interfaces.
- To modify this, you will need set_facts magic.
- You must use the iproute 2 package with ip addr not net-tools
- 'In playbook files, you should add in: gather_facts: True to update facts.'
- The uri tasks are running from Jenkins which is co-located on the Cloud9 IDE EC2
  instance.
- There are 2 separate EC2 service nodes that are part of the terraform/ansible Jenkins
  deployment.
- Use 'return_content=yes' on the task to see what the server is responding.
- AWX is the upstream project of automation controller.
- The API is version 2.
- Token can be generated for an AWX user through their user page.
- Username/password will work instead of a token.
- Use basic authentication with username and password
- The execution environment parameter must be correctly defined to avoid errors.
- Using the API’s there is no option to pass instance group details during creation.
- Instance groups aren’t supported by the existing installer at the moment.
- You’ll have to build your image on your own.
- Job should run on instances, not hosts.
- You can search nested values of valid objects using double underscores.
- Uses Bearer token for authentication
- Ensure the correct content-type header is set to application/json
- Community.general.json_query allows filtering of JSON results.
- Uses JSON for data return
- Can pipe results using jinja2
