- One event can contain up to 20 parameters, each of them with unique names of up
  to 32 symbols.
- Parameters can be string or numeric.
- Transaction identifiers that come from apps on Apple or Android platforms are checked
  for compliance.
- In case the currency identifier is not specified or the identifier is invalid, the
  transaction is considered invalid and is not counted in statistics.
- If after converting to USD the sum exceeds $1500, the transaction is considered
  invalid and is not counted in statistics as well.
- 'Some limits for custom events: The number of different event types sent from one
  project should not exceed 300. The event name must not exceed 72 characters. One
  event can contain up to 20 parameters, each of them with unique names of up to 32
  symbols. Parameters can be string or numeric: The maximum length of string parameter
  values is 255 characters. The number of unique string parameter values cannot exceed
  50000. When it exceeds 50000, the system will block the parameter.'
- Some of the events and properties are sent to devtodev automatically by the SDK.

- Automatic payment tracking is only available for the Google Play and App Store platforms,
  and only if you are using their native payment systems.
- You should not simultaneously use an automatic payment tracking system and send
  payment data using the integrated Real Payment and Subscription events, as this
  may result in duplicate payment data.
- Refund tracking works automatically â€” no changes in the SDK are required.
- The packet size cannot exceed 2 MB in its uncompressed state.
- Do not simultaneously use an automatic payment tracking system and send payment
  data using the integrated Real Payment and Subscription events, as this may result
  in duplicate payment data.
- If you cannot use the devtodev SDK, you can use the devtodev data API.

  of space.
- You can reset User API token or create it again on the same page.
- User API token is found in the settings of space.

- For iOS applications we recommend turning off the Advanced Privacy (for iOS 14.5+
  and later) option.
- devtodev allows our customers to query CPI data from AppsFlyer via Pull API.
- AppsFlyer has API daily rate limits, so adding CPI integration results in a single
  daily request per app.
- To improve the synchronization of the user data obtained by devtodev with the install
  data from Adjust, send Adjustâ€™s user ID data to devtodev.
- For iOS, send a user profile custom property named `ad_tracker_id` and assign it
  a string value of `{adid}`.
- Select Delivery method -> All
- In devtodev, open the application that you are configuring. Open Settings -> 3rd
  party sources -> Attribution tracking, turn on the toggle switch on Tenjin panel
  and copy devtodev API Key from the panel.

  -> Integration section in Application menu.
- Integration completed. Follow steps for each mobile app individually.
- Enable receiving CPI info by Singular Reporting API to switch on CPI data collection.
- The data we receive is encrypted, therefore, you need to decrypt it by using an
  Install Referrer Decryption Key, which is unique for each app.
- If you donâ€™t enter the Decryption Key in the app settings, then all the encrypted
  data sent by devtodev SDK will be discarded and can not be restored.
- API Key is required for access and can be obtained from Settings -> SDK -> Integration.
- if you have 2-factor authorisation enabled you will have to create app-specific
  password and use it as a password in devtodev
- This functionality is available only for projects with integrated devtodev SDK version
  2.1.0 or higher for native applications and not lower than 3.1.0 for Unity.
- When you integrate both data sources (App Store and SDK), youâ€™ll be able to see
  the Subscriptions report and devtodev will connect that data with the users successfully.
- Updating user permissions in Google Play Console may take up to 24 hours.
- If you have 2-factor authorisation enabled you will have to create app-specific
  password and use it as a password
- When you integrate both data sources (Google Play and SDK), youâ€™ll be able to see
  the Subscriptions report and devtodev will connect that data with the users successfully.
  If one of the integrations is missing, the Subscriptions report wonâ€™t be working
  correctly.

- For some other metrics (e.g. retention rate, installs), however, information is
  pulled from the user card.
- Information about Users and Payments is available for the whole time, the rest of
  the data is available for the last 90 days.
- API requires authentication for all endpoints

- The accuracy and quality of the integration affect the platform performance significantly.
- According to GDPR that came into effect on May 25, 2018, every user has right to
  be forgotten and their personal data must be stored for a limited amount of time.
- The check is being performed once a week.

- Games of this genre often have short game sessions, that means we should pay attention
  to the frequency of sessions.
- Custom events can be used to track user actions and analyze conversion rates.
- Some API calls may have usage limits
