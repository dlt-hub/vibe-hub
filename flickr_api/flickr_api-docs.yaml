  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as the `api_key` query parameter
    in requests. Set the `api_key` parameter to your actual API key value (e.g., "Your_api_key")
    alongside other request parameters like `method` and `gallery_id`.
  - Flickr API authentication uses an api_key parameter passed as a query parameter
    in GET requests. The api_key must be included in the request parameters with the
    key 'api_key' set to your API key value, which is then formatted into the query
    string of the REST endpoint URL at https://www.flickr.com/services/rest/?.
  - Flickr API uses API key authentication passed as a query parameter. The api_key
    parameter must be included in the request URL along with the method name and other
    parameters.
  - Flickr API uses either OAuth protocol or a simpler API key authentication method.
    For the API key approach, requests require a method parameter and an API key credential
    sent as a URL parameter to the Flickr API endpoint.
  - The Flickr API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named 'api_key'
    in GET requests to the REST endpoint at https://www.flickr.com/services/rest/.
    The API key value (stored in SP_APIkey) must be included along with the method
    parameter and other request parameters in the query string.
