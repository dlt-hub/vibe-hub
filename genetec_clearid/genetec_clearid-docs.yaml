auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.genetec.com/r/en-us/genetec-clearidtm-developer-guide/making-api-calls-in-swagger-ui:
  - Authentication with this API uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).
    Users authenticate via the Authorize button in Swagger UI, which initiates the
    PKCE flow to securely obtain an access token that is automatically included in
    subsequent API requests.
  - OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication is required. Use client_id "pkce_client"
    with an empty client_secret, and the authorization server will issue a bearer
    token after login. Include the bearer token in the Authorization header for subsequent
    API calls.

  : - ClearID uses OAuth2 with JWT bearer tokens for authentication. The clientId
      and private key (serialized JSON Web Key) are used to sign a JWT token, which
      is then exchanged for an access token via the STS URL at the `/connect/token`
      endpoint. The accountId must be included in every API call. The access token
      should be sent in the Authorization header as a bearer token to the Identity
      Service API and other endpoints.
    - 'Genetec ClearID uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for authentication.
      Send a POST request to the `/connect/token` endpoint with three form-encoded
      parameters in the HTTP body: client_id, client_secret, and grant_type set to
      "client_credentials". The response provides a bearer token for subsequent API
      calls. Use Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the token request,
      and include the bearer token in the Authorization header for authenticated API
      requests.'
    - JWT assertion token authentication is used, where you sign a JWT with id, accountid,
      kid, and key, then exchange it with STS for a Bearer access token. The token
      response includes access_token, expires_in (maximum 3600 seconds), token_type
      set to Bearer, and scope. Reuse tokens for at least 66% of their lifetime. JWT
      claims must include correct exp (expiration), aud (audience), iss (issuer),
      and sub (client ID) values, and the signature must be valid using the correct
      secret/private key and algorithm.
