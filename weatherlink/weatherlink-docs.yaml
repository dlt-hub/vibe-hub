notes:
- The embedded web server can process approximately three requests per second.
- Duration returned may be longer than the duration requested, if the broadcast is
  already enabled.
- If the new broadcast time requested is less than the time interval remaining for
  the previous broadcast, the new request is ignored.
- If the new broadcast time requested is greater than the time interval remaining
  for the previous broadcast, then the broadcast time is reset to the new time and
  the data broadcast is continued.
- The API Key must be passed as a query parameter in all API requests.
- The Sensor Catalog is a comprehensive list of all sensor types. Users should cache
  the information since changes are infrequent.
- The Sensor Catalog information presented here is for sensor types that are common
  to all users and covers all types of sensors except the Sentek EnviroSCAN probe.
- The WeatherLink v2 API is a shared resource between all API users.
- All API requests will be rate limited by the API Key.
- API requests for historic data requires a starting Unix timestamp parameter and
  ending Unix timestamp parameter to define the time window of the data being requested.
- The size of the time window is currently limited to 86,400 seconds, the equivalent
  of 24 hours, to prevent the API servers from being overwhelmed by many large requests
  at the same time.
- We have created a WeatherLink Developers Discord to serve as a central location
  for API related chat and support.
- Add support for new sensor types.
- Add support for demo mode.
