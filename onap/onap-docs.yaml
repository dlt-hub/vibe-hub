notes:
- WG Coordinators:@Ramki Krishnan
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Token Based Authentication is recommended
- Use https for external communication for security reasons
- DCAE Inventory is a composite API that relies on other APIs to obtain resources
  on underlying components.
- ErrorMessage is a common schema used for all error scenarios.
- Changing the schema will introduce no changes at the client side.

- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
