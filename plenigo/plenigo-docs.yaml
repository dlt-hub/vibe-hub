auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.plenigo.com/:
  - API access requires a token-based authentication scheme called plenigoToken, which
    must be provided to access endpoints. The plenigoToken is obtained via the requestRenewedToken
    endpoint using a requestToken query parameter, and the response returns a token
    field that should be used for subsequent API calls. Access rights are role-based,
    with endpoints requiring specific rights such as SETTINGS or any token.
  - Authorized requests to this API use plenigoToken. The token should be provided
    as an authorization credential when making requests to endpoints like dissociating
    app store purchases.
  - 'Based on the provided documentation, here is the authentication information:


    The endpoint requires plenigoToken authorization. Authentication is performed
    via a request body containing SSO provider data (specifically Google SSO authentication
    details) with an authenticationData object. The endpoint supports customer login
    verification through SSO providers with required fields including ssoProvider
    set to "GOOGLE" and an authenticationData object containing the SSO authentication
    credentials.'
  - 'Create address requires plenigoToken authorization. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as a bearer token (Authorization: Bearer <token>).'
  - Create future address endpoint uses plenigoToken authorization. The plenigoToken
    must be provided as authorization credentials to access this endpoint.

  - Cursor-based pagination using startingAfter and endingBefore query parameters,
    both optional strings up to 100 characters representing object IDs. Use the last

    and startingAfterId fields for navigation.
  - Cursor-based pagination using startingAfter and endingBefore query parameters,
    both optional strings up to 100 characters. Pass an object ID as startingAfter
