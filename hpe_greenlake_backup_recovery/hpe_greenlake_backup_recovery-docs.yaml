auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services:
  - Use a single OAuth token to access all APIs. Send the OAuth token in the Authorization
    header with the Bearer scheme.
  - Use a single OAuth token to access all HPE GreenLake APIs. The token is obtained
    through an OAuth 2.0 flow and sent in the Authorization header with bearer token
    format to authenticate requests across all services.
- information_source; https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/guides/public/authentication/authentication:
  - Access tokens are generated using Client ID and Client secret credentials via
    the Personal API clients interface. The access token functions as a bearer token
    and must be included in REST API calls for authorization. HPE GreenLake tokens
    expire after 15 minutes, while tokens for other HPE services expire after 120
    minutes. In MSP mode, tokens can be scoped to either the MSP workspace or a specific
    tenant workspace. The token must be copied and stored securely immediately after
    generation, as HPE GreenLake does not retain tokens.
  - 'Access tokens are obtained programmatically using client credentials (client
    ID and client secret) and used as bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Include
    `-H ''Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_HERE>''` in request headers, replacing the
    placeholder with your token. HPE GreenLake cloud tokens expire after 15 minutes;
    tokens for other HPE services expire after 120 minutes. Tokens must be securely
    stored locally as HPE GreenLake does not store them server-side.'
  - 'The access token is used as an authorization bearer token in the Authorization
    header. Include the header `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_HERE>` in your REST
    API request, replacing `<YOUR_JWT_HERE>` with your actual JWT access token. The
    access token is generated programmatically using client credentials (client ID
    and client secret), which can be reset or deleted as needed for security purposes.'
