  - oAuth tokens are required for all API calls. The Authorization header must be
    included in every request, with the token obtained through oAuth authentication.
    The exact header name is Authorization and the token value should be passed as
    a bearer token in this header.

  - You need to include a valid authorization token in requests to the Outseta REST
    API. For server-side usage, create an API key in Settings >> Integrations >> API
    Keys, then construct the authorization token as "Outseta [APIKey]:[SecretKey]"
    and send it in the Authorization header. For client-side usage, call the Get Auth
    API from the server side with your Outseta username and password to obtain a bearer
    token, then construct the authorization token as "bearer [AuthToken]" in the Authorization
    header.

    a colon and optional secret. Send this Authorization header with all requests
    to authenticate.
  - The Postmates API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The Authorization header must
    be set to "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of your API key (or credentials
    in the format key:). The base64 string is passed directly in the Authorization
    header with no additional parameters required.
