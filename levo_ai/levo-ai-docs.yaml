notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Documentation isn't improving, even as APIs multiply
- Developers want to build not write specs
- Poor documentation kills security testing at the source
- API documentation is essential for developers to understand how to integrate and
  interact with APIs.
- Levo captures auth scopes, identities, and data flows across APIs and AI assets
  to expose real risk, not noise.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication
- Sensitive data detection is included
- Security can no longer be an afterthought right now.
- With the current influx of security incidents, security must always be built into
  the product code and architecture.
- Levo provides end-to-end visibility across AI agents, MCP Servers, LLMs and LLM
  Applications.
- Levo provides runtime visibility across AI agents and applications.
- Levo passively observes AI traffic, providing full visibility into the machine-to-machine
  flows that drive most AI interactions.
- Detection is passive at runtime. Levo does not sit inline or block by default.
- Levo turns red teaming from a noisy checkbox into a business enabler detecting only
  exploitable risks.
- Dynamic testing across agents, LLMs, MCPs, RAG & APIs
- Validates only exploitable risks, filters noise
- Levo monitors APIs automatically, regardless of language, framework, or deployment
  method.
- Levo runs passively alongside your workflows and does not block or delay builds.
- Levo’s API Inventory is a continuously updated, behavior-aware map of all APIs across
  your environments.
- Levo lets you define custom posture rules in Python or YAML to reflect your unique
  business, regulatory, and partner requirements.
- Sensitive data exposure ranks 3rd in volume But 1'st in trust fallout
- Levo secures sensitive data where it’s most at risk
- Levo's API Inventory facilitates true understanding by surfacing how each API behaves,
  where it exists and what it exposes.
- Levo enables compliance with frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, SOC
  2, SEBI CSCRF, and DPDP by continuously mapping sensitive data and enforcing real-time
  access controls.
- MCP exposes standardized, language-agnostic primitives that work with existing IDEs,
  LLM agents, or internal tools
- Levo auto-detects each API’s authentication scheme OAuth2, JWT, mTLS, API keys and
  dynamically manages token generation, injection, renewal, and expiry.
- Levo continuously discovers and documents every internal, external, partner, and
  third-party API mapping versions, methods, auth patterns, payloads, and sensitive
  data flows in real-time.
- Levo actively monitors OAuth token scopes, consent bindings, and session validations
  automatically detecting drift, misuse, and unauthorized expansions.
- MCP exposes structured, real-time, and governed access to security intelligence.
- Fintechs racing to ship APIs weekly without continuous discovery and governance
  can lead to undocumented and abandoned APIs.
- APIs shipped without robust authentication, authorization, and consent governance
  can result in data leakage.
- Levo auto-generates rich API documentation in real-time from actual traffic, code
  repositories and logs.
- Developers don't need to ping five channels or check outdated wikis to see if an
  API already exists, they just build on what's already there.
- Secure third party provider (TPP) onboarding without core exposure
- Automate vulnerability testing for OAuth flows
- Levo integrates into your CI/CD to test every feature, integration, and release
  automatically.
- Focused on static security testing (OpenAPI specs)
- Yes – focused on shift left API testing
- Dev-first integration with openAPI, Postman, CI/CD
- 'Strong support: GitHub, Postman, CI/CD integrations'
- Testing only; No runtime detection
- Dev focused SaaS only
- Testing + code quality enforcement
- Levo continuously inspects API traffic and classifies all sensitive data flowing
  through endpoints, including PHI, insurance numbers, login credentials, and consent
  forms.
- requires traffic capture + spec ingestion
- derived from specs + NTA; misses undocumented APIs
- Levo monitors API behavior continuously across environments.
- Security that keeps up with your CI/ID
- Levo replaces the security stack that was never built for modern applications
- No hidden fees. No forced upsells. Your pricing is scoped to match the value you
  derive and the risk we help mitigate.
- We provide geo aware pricing that aligns with your market and preserves our gold
  standard support.
- Levo integrates into CI/CD pipelines, not just post-release audits
- Sensitive data detection, access validation, and exploit-aware testing happens at
  the point of change
- Cookies are used for tracking and analytics purposes.
- manual re-import needed for new endpoints
- Privacy-first architecture, no customer payload ingestion
- Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you
  with services.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Levo
errors:
