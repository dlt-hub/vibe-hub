notes:
- Data caching is used to speed up the runtime and to prevent exceeding the rate limit
  of web servers.
- SoccerData has no knowledge of when the data on the server changes, so it is up
  to the user to decide when to refresh the cache.
- Data will be downloaded as necessary and cached locally in ~/soccerdata/data/ESPN
- Data will be downloaded as necessary and cached locally in ~/soccerdata/data/MatchHistory.
- Data will be downloaded as necessary and cached locally.
- You might encounter errors when trying to scrape data for the leagues you added
  yourself.
- You can setup a SOCKS5 proxy with Tor.
- After installing Tor, make sure to start it up before scraping.
- Uses Selenium with the ChromeDriver extension to emulate a real user for WhoScored
  data.
