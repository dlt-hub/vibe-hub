notes:
- Immutable's universal wallet and authentication solution. Get users onboarded in
  seconds
- Redirect URLs must be specified for proper OAuth flow.
- $IMX is used as the native gas token on Immutable zkEVM.
- Minimum gas price of 10 gwei to protect against SPAM traffic.
- Blob transactions are not currently supported. Any such transactions will be rejected
  by the Immutable zkEVM RPC.
- 'Immutable currently has one gating list: Transaction blocklist.'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Immutable Contracts are a suite of audited, ready-to-use smart contracts built for
  Immutable zkEVM.
- Game developers can use them as-is and deploy them through Immutable Hub.
- Gasless transactions are those that have the gas fee paid for by a third party instead
  of the transaction sender.
- Immutable will be the only node provider at testnet launch, however we will look
  to expand in the future.
- To use Immutable X, you will first need to connect to Ethereum.
- Metadata can be stored on cloud storage, IPFS, or on-chain.
- Choosing the right storage method impacts update efficiency and costs.
- Users can either bring their own Metamask wallet or utilize Passport for user authentication.
errors:
- 'INVALID_CLIENT: Check client ID and secret.'
- 'UNAUTHORIZED: Verify the scope and token.'
- 'NOT_FOUND: The requested resource does not exist.'
- Transactions with a tip cap below 10 gwei are rejected by the RPC.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
