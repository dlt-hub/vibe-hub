auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.xcp-ng.org/management/manage-at-scale/xo-api/:
  - A valid authentication token must be attached as a cookie named authenticationToken
    to all HTTP requests. The token is created from the Xen Orchestra UI in the user
    space and sent via the Cookie header or the -b flag in curl. Invalid tokens receive
    a 401 Unauthorized response.
  - Authentication uses a cookie-based token approach. Send the authentication token
    in a Cookie header with the name authenticationToken set to the token value obtained
    from the authentication system.
  - Authentication uses a cookie-based token mechanism. Include the authentication
    token in a cookie named authenticationToken with each request.
  - 'Authentication uses a token-based approach sent as a cookie. Create a token via
    the Xen Orchestra UI or using xo-cli with admin credentials, then include it in
    requests as Cookie: authenticationToken=<token>. Only admin users can access the
    API.'
- information_source; https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/6516/rest-api:
  - The documentation excerpt shows a REST API authentication example using a cookie-based
    token approach. Authentication is performed by passing an `authenticationToken`
    cookie with the request (e.g., `curl -b authenticationToken=MYTOKEN`), where MYTOKEN
    is the actual authentication token value.
