auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.daxko.com/v3/docs/tutorials/authentication/index.html:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with JWT tokens. POST to {base_url}/v3/partners/oauth2/token
    with Authorization header containing Bearer refresh_token, and form parameters
    grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, client_secret, and scope. The response
    returns an access_token (JWT) with expires_in (seconds) and token_type=bearer.
    Use the returned access_token in the Authorization header as Bearer token for
    subsequent API requests.
  - The Daxko API uses OAuth2 with the client_credentials flow. To obtain an access_token,
    POST to /v3/partners/oauth2/token with client_id (your username), client_secret
    (your password), and scope parameters. The returned access_token is then used
    in subsequent API requests to access protected endpoints and is scoped to a specific
    Daxko Client ID, restricting returned data to that client only.

  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
  - The Authorization header is required on all requests. The documentation indicates
    an "authorization header" must be present but the specific format, scheme (e.g.,
    Bearer token, API key), and value details are truncated and not fully specified
    in the provided text.
- information_source; https://api.daxko.com/v3/docs/tutorials/member_authentication/index.html:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow is used for member authentication. Configure
    settings via the Save member OAuth2 settings API call with required parameters:
    valid_redirect_uris (list of redirect URLs on your site), and optional links.sign_up.url
    and links.forgot_password.url. Users are sent to a Daxko login form, which redirects
    back to your site with an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access
    token via server-to-server API calls.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.daxko.com/v3/docs/tutorials/getting_started/index.html:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with an `after` query parameter that is returned
    in the response body to fetch subsequent pages. A `links` array in the response
    contains URL links for related pages.
  - Cursor-based pagination uses an `after` query parameter to fetch subsequent pages.
    The response includes an `after` field containing the cursor for the next page
    and a `links` array with a `rel="next"` entry containing the full URL for fetching
    the next page. If the `next` link is absent, pagination is complete. The `limit`
    and `sort` parameters are preserved in the next URL for consistent ordering.
