notes:
- Define <transactionlink-widget /> element in the DOM.
- Define window.transactionlink_ready method. It is called when the widget and widget
  API are ready to use.
- TransactionLink is a no-code platform that reduces the engineering complexity of
  building digital onboarding flows.
- Build your digital onboarding journey in minutes, not days.
- Our no-code builder lets you orchestrate multiple providers together to build and
  update your onboarding journeys in realtime without engineering effort.
- The sandbox workspace is isolated from production and is intended for integration
  testing.
- In the sandbox environment, dummy data is returned, allowing you to test your integrations
  without affecting real production data.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Utilizes API keys associated with your workspace
- Sandbox workspace is intended for integration testing
- Case must be created for every new end user.
- Generate a new token each time you initialise the TransactionLink Widget.
- You must generate a new token each time you initialise the TransactionLink Widget
- Ensure that you create a Case for every new end user, as it acts as their representation
  within the system.
- Make sure to manage and utilise sensitive data of your customers with due care and
  caution.
- Once live you will be getting access to sensitive data of your customers.
- If you want to use this functionality, our team needs to prepare the appropriate
  configuration in coordination with you.
- When autoHeight is enabled, the widget or iframe will dynamically adjust its size
  based on the content inside, ensuring proper rendering without requiring a fixed
  height.
- The showCloseButton option controls whether a close button appears in inline mode.
  By default, it is undefined, meaning the button is hidden.
- recordId is optional unless you are using our CRM system.
- Uses API key and secret key for authentication.
- Creating a case is now optional.
- The API for creating cases will be deprecated.
- recordId is optional unless using the CRM system.
- The API for Cases has been marked as deprecated in favor of the new Records system
  and will be removed according to the scheduled timeline.
- 'Varied Endpoint Compatibility: Please note that not all endpoints support multiple
  versions. Consequently, use your preferred version wisely.'
