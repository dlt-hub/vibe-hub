notes:
- RocksDB recovers tables in seconds or less, is embedded and don’t require a server
  or additional infrastructure.
- This docstring is used as the command help in --help.
- The app can be started in 'client-only' mode for sending agent RPC requests.
- Use 'autodiscover=True' to traverse the directory for agents, timers, tasks.
- The changelog topic description to use for this table is only for advanced users
  who know what they’re doing.
- If enabled, timers will only execute on one of the worker instances at a time.
- This setting disables the creation of internal topics.
- Some Kafka managers does not allow services to create topics, in that case you should
  set this to `False`.
- Enable web server and other web components.
- How often we cleanup tables to remove expired entries.
- The number of standby replicas for each table.
