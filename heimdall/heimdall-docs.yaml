  - 'The API requires three custom headers for authentication: x-api-key (issued when
    the endpoint is configured and cannot be retrieved if lost), x-username (associated
    with your account), and x-forecast-id (unique identifier for the forecasting model).
    API keys are generated once per model and must be saved immediately as they cannot
    be regenerated or retrieved later.'
