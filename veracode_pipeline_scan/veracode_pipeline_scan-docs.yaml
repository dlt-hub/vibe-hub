auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.veracode.com/r/REST_APIs_Quickstart:
  - The Veracode REST API uses HMAC authentication. Credentials are stored in a Postman
    environment variable named `hmacAuthHeader`, which should be set to secret type
    for enhanced security. The authentication header is automatically applied when
    requests are sent through Postman using the configured environment containing
    your Veracode API credentials.
- information_source; https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_apps_intro:
  - Veracode Applications API uses HMAC authentication. Credentials are sent as an
    Authorization header using the veracode_hmac scheme. The API key and secret are
    required and must be configured in your authentication setup to sign requests
    with HMAC.
- information_source; https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_identity_intro:
  - The Veracode API uses HMAC authentication for these JWT token deletion endpoints.
    Requests must be made with the auth type set to veracode_hmac, which requires
    signing requests with Veracode API credentials (ID and secret) using HMAC-SHA256.
    The credentials are typically provided via environment variables or configuration
    and are used to generate the Authorization header that signs the request.
  - The Veracode API uses HMAC authentication. Send requests with the auth-type parameter
    set to veracode_hmac. Credentials are derived from your Veracode API ID and key,
    which the HTTP client (like httpie) uses to sign requests automatically when you
    specify --auth-type=veracode_hmac.
  - The Veracode API uses HMAC-based authentication. Send requests with the --auth-type=veracode_hmac
    flag, which signs requests using your Veracode API credentials (typically an API
    ID and secret key pair stored as environment variables or passed to the HTTP client).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_identity_intro:
  - Pagination uses query parameter `page` (starting at 1) for page navigation, with
    default page size of 20 roles. Query parameter `size` controls page size up to
    a maximum of 500.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0, default 0) and size (default
    20, maximum 20). Resend requests with incrementing page numbers to retrieve subsequent
    pages.
  - The permissions endpoint uses page-based pagination with a query parameter named
    page (page=1, page=2, etc.). By default, 20 permissions are returned per page.
    The size parameter can also be specified (as shown in the roles endpoint example
    with size=500).
