notes:
- VPN services with different protocols can use different VPN profiles.
- It is highly recommended that you turn on the two-factor authentication mechanism
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The list includes up to 5,000 active sessions
- 'Export tasks can have statuses: In progress, Done, No data, Failed'
- Log page provides a history of all project changes.
- Logs can be downloaded as a CSV file.
- The SDK supports overriding default backend API URLs by adding a new raw resource
  file named pango_default_urls.json to your project.
- Supports Hydra, OpenVPN, Wireguard protocols.
- Requires iOS 13+ or macOS 10.15+
- It is not possible for users to create their own accounts directly if they do not
  already have an account established.
- Sign in at pango-cloud.com to create a project and use a name for your project as
  a Public key.
- Dynamic configuration without SDK restart allows modifying VPN settings in real-time.
- Dynamic configuration without SDK restart
- Transparent tunneling is supported
- No actual connection is made until the first network packet is sent.
- Connection is initiated immediately.
- Selective routing by IP, MAC, or interface name.
- The SDK library does not handle traffic routing for the Wireguard protocol.
- It is not possible for users to create their own accounts directly if they do not
  already have an account established with example.com.
- SDK logs are displayed at Trace level.
- Avoid using DEBUG or TRACE log levels for SDK logs in PROD, unless absolutely necessary
  for troubleshooting.
- At this time, it is not possible for users to create their own accounts directly
  if they do not already have an account established with example.com.
- Users cannot create their own accounts directly if they do not already have an account
  established with example.com.
- This limited version does not support dynamic configuration via websockets or any
  kind of statistics/reporting.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Xcode 16.1 or later is required for developing with the Unified VPN SDK.
- Enable the 'Personal VPN' capability for the App ID.
- Bitcode is now deprecated.
- Each VPN protocol (Hydra and WireGuard) requires its own separate Network Extension
  target.
- Set `Do Not Embed` under `Embed` option for **HydraTunnelProvider.framework**.
- Set `Do Not Embed` under `Embed and sign` option for **WireguardTunnelProvider.framework**.
- To properly configure your Network Extension target, it is essential to set the
  `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` and `NetworkExtensionDelegate` in the Info.plist file.
- If you want to set a breakpoint in start lifecycle methods (such as `vpnWillStart`),
  you need to attach the debugger before connecting to the VPN.
- Ensure that your app is already running and the VPN connection is active (VPN icon
  is visible in the status bar).
- VPN protocol library versioning
- PKI support is enabled by default
- The default value for On-Demand VPN is false.
- 'Use the correct extension bundle ID for tvOS: com.anchorfree.TestAppTVOS.wireguard'
- 'Set usesSystemExtension: false for tvOS in the group data configuration'
- When using a VPN service, unexpected disconnection can expose real IP address and
  traffic.
- The killswitch blocks all network traffic outside of the VPN tunnel with exceptions
  for local network traffic and user-defined rules.
- Currently WireGuard protocol does not support wildcards as it is expects IPv4 addresses
  to be provided for bypassing.
- Multihop routing is only available for the Hydra protocol. For other protocols,
  this setting will be ignored.
- Multihop is not supported on tvOS devices.
- CNL settings control VPN behavior based on network conditions.
- When VPN is connected, CNL rules can dynamically enable or disable the tunnel based
  on the current network.
- Traffic for subdomains of domain1.com, domain2.net and domain3.org will be routed
  through the VPN.
- All other traffic will bypass the VPN and use direct connections.
- The configuration also supports wildcards.
