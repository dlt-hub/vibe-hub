Here's a complete YAML configuration for the `klarna_settlements` REST API source based on the provided documentation:

client:
  base_url: "https://api.klarna.com/"
  auth:
    type: "basic"  # Authentication type is basic as per the documentation
    # Additional auth parameters if needed
    username: "your_username"  # replace with actual username
    password: "your_password"  # replace with actual password

resources:
  - name: "payouts"
    endpoint: "/payouts"  # Placeholder endpoint, actual endpoint must be confirmed
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters, adjust as needed
      status: "completed"  # Example parameter; actual parameters need to be confirmed
    data_selector: "$"  # JSONPath to select data from response

  - name: "transactions"
    endpoint: "/transactions"  # Placeholder endpoint, actual endpoint must be confirmed
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters, adjust as needed
      start_date: "2023-01-01"  # Example parameter; actual parameters need to be confirmed
      end_date: "2023-12-31"    # Example parameter; actual parameters need to be confirmed
    data_selector: "$"  # JSONPath to select data from response

notes:
  - "Klarna API uses basic authentication where the username and password are required."
  - "Rate limit is 200 requests per second; exceeding this limit will result in throttling."
  - "The API does not support OAuth, which may limit integration options with some platforms."

errors:
  - 401  # Unauthorized
  - 403  # Forbidden
  - 429  # Too Many Requests

auth_info:
  mentioned_objects:
    - "Basic authentication with username and password required."

source_metadata:
  description: "The Klarna Settlements API provides endpoints to manage and retrieve information related to payouts and transactions."

Notes:
- The actual endpoints for `payouts` and `transactions` should be confirmed from the official documentation or API reference, as they were not explicitly provided in the scraped content.
- Placeholder values for parameters (`status`, `start_date`, `end_date`) are examples and should be adjusted based on actual API documentation.
- Ensure to replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the actual credentials used for authentication.
