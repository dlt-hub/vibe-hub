  - 'The API requires an Authorization header (exact name: Authorization) containing
    an AuthorizationString. The request body includes an accessControlList with ACL
    configuration items specifying permissions by entity ID (eid), service, region,
    effect, resource, and permission. A durationSeconds query parameter optionally
    sets token validity (default 43200 seconds/12 hours).'
  - The API uses Access Key (AK) and Secret Key (SK) credentials to generate a session
    token via STS. Authentication is performed by including an Authorization header
    in requests to the STS endpoint at sts.bj.baidubce.com, with credentials (accessKey,
    secretAccessKey) used to compute the AuthorizationString. The response includes
    sessionToken, accessKey, secretAccessKey, expiration date, and userId for subsequent
    authenticated API calls.
  - 'The API uses a custom Authorization header (line 4: "Authorization: AuthorizationString")
    for authentication. The exact format and credentials for the AuthorizationString
    are not specified in this documentation excerpt.'
  - 'The API uses a request signature-based authorization scheme. Requests must include
    an Authorization header containing an AuthorizationString. The request is sent
    to the STS service endpoint (sts.bj.baidubce.com) with required headers: Date,
    Content-type, and Content-Length. Authentication appears to be based on request
    signing with credentials (id field in body suggests credential identifier).'
  - The API uses temporary STS credentials (AK/SK and SessionToken) obtained from
    the GetSessionToken API. Requests require a valid AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey
    passed via the Authorization header using a signature-based authentication scheme.
    The GetSessionToken endpoint accepts POST requests with a durationSeconds query
    parameter and returns temporary credentials including AK/SK, SessionToken, and
    expiration time that clients use for subsequent API calls.
