auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/web-app/api-docs.html:
  - API requests require Bearer token authentication. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer " followed by the encoded token value. The token issuer URL
    is available in TOKEN['token']['unencoded']['iss']. Content-Type header should
    be set to application/json.
  - 'API requests require a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The token
    is obtained from a TOKEN object with structure TOKEN[''token''][''encoded''] for
    the credential value and TOKEN[''token''][''unencoded''][''iss''] for the API
    base URL. Send requests with header Authorization: Bearer <encoded_token> and
    content-type: application/json.'
  - API uses Bearer token authentication. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer " + encoded token value. The token object contains an encoded field
    for the header value and an iss field indicating the API base URL.
  - Authentication requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The
    token object contains an encoded token value (used in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {encoded_token}") and an issuer URL (iss field) that forms the base
    URL for API requests. The content-type header should be set to application/json.
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. The token is passed in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer ' + encoded token value. The token object contains an 'encoded'
    field for the header value and an 'iss' field for the base URL. Content-Type header
    should be set to 'application/json'.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/web-app/rest-api:
  - Paginated GET requests use query string parameters per (page size) and page (page
    number). For example, GET https://my.farm.bot/api/sensor_readings?page=3&per=10
    retrieves the third page with 10 items per page. Stop when the returned page contains
    fewer items than the requested page size.
