notes:
- API pillars help teams make smaller decisions quickly and easily.
- Without clearly-defined API pillars, teams will fail to prioritize their work.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Blackbird offers a built-in code generator with initial support for the Go Programming
  Language
- Blackbird provides a searchable catalog to locate previously registered APIs
- Blackbird helps accelerate API design lifecycle.
- Built-in AI bot can generate OpenAPI documents.
- API pillars serve as the guiding principles that define the foundation and direction
  of an API platform.
- API governance isn’t about restricting developers or burdening teams with extra
  processes; it’s about creating a clear, sustainable path for the organization to
  achieve consistent, secure, and efficient API management.
- API governance is the backbone of a successful API platform.
- The generated code is modular, with a clean separation between the schema objects
  that represent our resources and the supporting code to handle each operation.
- Blackbird offers a built-in code generator with initial support for the Go Programming
  Language from their command line tool (CLI).
- Expect a continued effort to produce a leaner API program through self-service API
  training, establishing a federated API coach program, and new API governance engagement
  models that make better use of time and resources.
- The growing emphasis on reuse will drive demand for API portfolio ownership, focus
  on API discovery and cataloging, and improved lifecycle management of APIs.
- API generation software is rethinking how you design APIs.
- Establishing a formalized API coach program helps to equip people all over the organization
  to better support teams when and where they need API guidance.
- API coaches enable an API program to scale across the organization by becoming an
  extension of the API C4E across all lines of business.
- API governance is essential for consistent and secure API management.
- Blackbird provides a searchable catalog to locate a previously registered API.
- Blackbird supports a consume-first culture, avoiding the need to build duplicate
  APIs.
- A single Heroku account may host any number of applications.
- Heroku provides one dyno for free per application.
- Heroku hosts a variety of applications, some of which see little or no activity
  during a 24 hour period.
- To overcome process reaping, install the New Relic add-on or use a third-party website
  health check service.
