notes:
- GerryChain is used for analyzing districting plans.
- ReCom chains require a proper graph structure for accurate processing.
- The ReCom proposal needs to know the ideal population for the districts so that
  we can improve speed by bailing early on unbalanced partitions.
- The api provides districting plans for the state of GerryMandria and Pennsylvania.
- The ReCom proposal needs to know the ideal population for the districts.
- Use functools.partial to bind the extra parameters of the recom proposal.
- In general, the techniques described here are not appropriate for storing the entire
  Markov chain of redistricting plans.
- The methods described below are primarily aimed at the collection and analysis of
  statistical information about each of the partitions in the chain.
- Most often, these geometries come in the form of shapefiles.
- The `GeographicPartition` class allows us the capability of working with geometries
  throughout our Markov chain.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- In general, it is easier to use jupyter notebooks with bespoke virtual environments
  through a text editor like VSCode.
