client:
  auth: To authenticate with Bitbucket APIs, you can use API tokens, OAuth 2.0, or
    app passwords, where API tokens can be obtained as workspace access tokens, app
    passwords are created by a workspace admin, and OAuth 2.0 requires setting privilege
    scopes; for OAuth 2.0, a refresh token may also be needed, and specific scopes
    must be defined for access.
  most_recurring_base_url: https://api.bitbucket.org
  paginator: Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply pagination,
    and the paginated collections are wrapped in a specific wrapper object; a page
    size is indicated by the "pagelen" parameter (default page size is not mentioned)
    and a cursor is not required.
