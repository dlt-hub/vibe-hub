auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.jmix.io/cuba-platform/guides/rest-apis:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token. The auth_token must be obtained first
    and passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for each request to the
    REST API service endpoints.
  - Authorization uses OAuth2 password grant flow. Send a POST request to /app/rest/v2/oauth/token
    with Basic authentication using cubaRestClientId and cubaRestClientSecret, and
    form-encoded parameters grant_type=password, username, and password. The response
    contains an access_token field with a bearer token that must be stored and used
    in subsequent authenticated requests. The access_token has an expires_in value
    in seconds and a corresponding refresh_token for token renewal.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}} header is required. The auth_token is a
    bearer token that must be included in the Authorization header for all requests
    to the REST API endpoint.'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}} header is required. The token is passed
    in the Authorization header with "Bearer" scheme for API requests.'
  - 'CUBA OAuth2 API Authentication uses a two-step process: first, a client sends
    login credentials (username and password) to retrieve an access token via POST
    to the /app/rest/v2/oauth/token endpoint with Basic Authorization header, then
    the short-lived access token is sent with each subsequent request as an HTTP header
    to authenticate further API interactions.'
