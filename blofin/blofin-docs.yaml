- Last updated on 24 June 2025.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Insilico Terminal does not provide service to individuals or entities located in
  the United States.
- It's good security practice to create a separate Key for each platform you use
- API Key is required for access.
- Requires setup of API key
- Ensure you have made a deposit into your Hyperliquid account before connecting.
- Vaults don't pay the builder fee.
- Hyperliquid has removed the broker fee program in favor of builder codes.
- API Keys are stored in your browser only and will be deleted if browser data and
  cookies are cleared.
- When changing to a new browser or device, you will have to add your keys again.
- As your API Keys are stored in your browser only, please note that deleting your
  browser data and cookies will also delete your API keys and you will need to re-add
  them.
- When changing to a new browser or new device, you will have to add your keys again.
- 2FA must be enabled on your account to use this feature.
- Synchronized keys are stored in a fully isolated environment accessible only by
  Insilico servers, with no external internet access.
- API key synchronization is deactivated by default and requires activation.
- Insilico Terminal can now be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling
  you to access it like a native application directly from your device.
- This provides a seamless experience with features such as quick access without relying
  on a browser tab.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API keys are never stored on our servers.
- With Terminal 3.6 we have added the Tradingview component as a beta version.
- It will be upgraded in the coming weeks.
- Legacy Close Buttons can be activated in settings for faster closing of positions.
- This used to be part of the old Orderform.
- Shows information for any open position(s) for this instrument.
- 'There are two selectable tabs by order type: Limit and Market.'
- Uses dual input controls for sizing orders
- When activated the order is placed as a 'reduce only' order, i.e. it can only reduce
  or close an existing position, it cannot open a new position or add to an existing
  one.
- This control is a convenience to quickly place a Take Profit and/or a market Stop
  whilst executing an entry order.
- For the Stop exist two modes; absolute price (use +/- 0.5% for quick setting) or
  relative price expressed as a percentage.
- The price inputs for Stop and Target can also be filled via clicking on the chart.
- Loss and Gain numbers will be displayed at anytime.
- Bybit has independent leverage settings for Long and Short positions.
- 'If you want to switch to Cross but encounter the error: "You have existing positions/orders
  in opposing directions with different leverage settings or risk limits for the same
  contract under Isolated Margin" - have to go through all the markets btcusdt, ethusdt,
  solusdt, etc ... to find which one has mismatched buy/sell leverage and set the
  two leverage values to an identical value.'
- Post Only, ensure order enters as maker
- when executed, this will reduce a position’s size (requires position)
- With a limit stop the price first has to hit your trigger and then travel 'back'
  to the limit in order to fill, there is no guarantee that the limit order will be
  filled.
- Total Orders minimum of 2, maximum of 100 (Bybit) or 50 (Binance)
- Scales multiple orders on one side close to price.
- It is almost identical to the Scale order, except that it is meant for rather quick
  entries as a scalping tool.
- Chase To sets the maximum acceptable adverse price for your order.
- Uses multiple simultaneous chase orders.
- Simple market order, immediate execution.
- Market stop order. When the Trigger Price is hit, a market order for the given Size
  will execute.
- Swarm takes a given Total Size and splits the size into a number of Total Lots and
  executes them in parallel as fast as possible.
- TWAP is cancelable at any moment.
- This option is to help avoiding detection of your running TWAP by public market
  trackers.
- Closing the Terminal will end the TWAP process.
- Not all of the Terminal features are supported yet.
- There is a maximum of 12 hours and a minimum of 5 minutes.
- This is a long running process, you may continue trading using the Terminal’s other
  functions and monitor the TWAP progress in the Activity panel.
- All user variables start with the '@' symbol
- Variables work with any type of number or string.
- They can be used for size, price, the number of orders you want to place, the method
  of scale (cubic, linear).
- 'When specifying sizes or numbers in the CLI, you can generally provide them in
  three different ways: Absolute, Relative, Percent, and Currency.'
- All constants start with the "$" symbol
- Commands can be shortened, e.g., 'nuke pos' for 'nuke positions'.
- Note that the next command does not await the previous command to "finish" or succeed.
- While they are essentially the same you should use `;` around `sleep` commands.
- Best to incorporate a short sleep here.
- Shorthand commands available for nuke positions and nuke orders
- Commands that can be utilized to control different aspects of the Terminal user
  interface.
- This is currently only available for the DOM but will expand to the rest of app
  later.
- This is currently only available for the DOM but will expand to the rest of app

- Please read the page on Simple Ordering first
- The current implementation technically amends every order individually, so if you're
  bumping a larger number of orders rapidly, i.e. multiple times per second you might
  be subject to exchange Rate Limits and experience amend-fails.
- Stops are currently not amended with bumping.
- You can use the variable $size instead of typing a number directly.
- all commands operate on the currently viewed instrument only
- All commands also operate on explicit symbols, simply add the symbol at the end
  of each command
- Executes a twap of <count> number of orders of a given total <size> over a number
  of <minutes>
- '2FA / MFA : Use provider''s UI for 1st configuration'

  adding to the Terminal.
