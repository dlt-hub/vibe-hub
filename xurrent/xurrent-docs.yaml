auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.xurrent.com/graphql/:
  - 'Authorization is via OAuth2 bearer token. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: bearer <oauth-token>" when making requests to https://graphql.xurrent.com/.
    Additionally, the X-Xurrent-Account header is required for all requests except
    the introspection GET request.'
  - 'The Xurrent GraphQL API requires two HTTP headers for authentication. First,
    supply an Authorization header with a Bearer token obtained as a personal access
    token generated in the Xurrent Specialists console under My Profile > Personal
    Access Tokens. Second, supply an X-Xurrent-Account header with your account ID
    to specify which account the request targets. The personal access token must have
    appropriate scopes: Read action for queries on the accessed model node types,
    and Create or Update action for mutations. Example headers: Authorization: Bearer
    <oauth-token> and X-Xurrent-Account: <accountID>.'
  - 'The Xurrent GraphQL API uses OAuth token-based authentication. Each request requires
    two HTTP headers: Authorization header with format "Bearer <oauth-token>" where
    the token is obtained as a Personal Access Token from My Profile or via an OAuth
    Application from Settings, and X-Xurrent-Account header containing the account
    ID.'
- information_source; https://developer.xurrent.com/v1/:
  - 'Each request to the Xurrent REST API requires two HTTP headers: Authorization
    header with Bearer token format containing an OAuth token, and X-Xurrent-Account
    header containing the account ID. OAuth tokens can be obtained by generating a
    Personal Access Token from My Profile in Xurrent or by creating an OAuth Application
    from Settings. The token must include appropriate scopes for the requested actions.'
  - Personal Access Tokens are used for authentication. Generate a token via My Profile
    > Personal Access Tokens > Generate token. Include the token in API requests using
    the Authorization header with Bearer scheme. To access resources from trusted
    accounts, add the X-Xurrent-Account header with the account identifier (e.g.,
    "wna-it").
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.xurrent.com/v1/general/changelog/:
  - Pagination is implemented via response headers. The API returns x-pagination-current-page,
    x-pagination-per-page, x-pagination-total-entries, x-pagination-total-pages, x-pagination-next-page,
    x-pagination-last-page, and x-pagination-throttled headers (case-insensitive).
    A Link header is also provided. Request parameters for controlling pagination
    are not described in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://developer.xurrent.com/v1/general/pagination/:
  - 'API requests return paginated collections with a default page size of 20 records,
    adjustable via the optional `?per_page=` query parameter (maximum 100). Pagination
    state is provided in response headers: `x-pagination-per-page`, `x-pagination-current-page`,
    `x-pagination-total-pages`, and `x-pagination-total-entries`. Navigation uses
    the Link header with rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next", and rel="last" to construct
    subsequent requests using `search_after` and `search_before` query parameters.'
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel values (first, prev, next) containing full
    URLs for navigation. Query parameter per_page controls page size. Response includes
    x-pagination-throttled header set to true when results exceed 100,000 records,
    indicating retrieval is capped at that limit.
- information_source; https://developer.xurrent.com/v1/search/:
  - Search API requests are paginated with a default page size of 25 records, adjustable
    via the `?per_page=` query parameter with a maximum of 100. The response includes
    the `x-pagination-next-page` header containing a token to use as the `?page=`
    parameter for retrieving the next page, and a Link header with rel="next" for
    navigation.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with the `x-pagination-next-page` header
    token passed as the `page` query parameter for subsequent requests. The `per_page`
    query parameter controls page size, and the pagination token remains valid for
    30 minutes. Note that search results may contain duplicates across pages due to
    non-deterministic relevance scoring.
