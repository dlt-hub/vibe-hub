- 'Since 20.06.22g all new connections have the following temporary limitations in
  the functionality of the integration: buttons in chatbots are not supported; goods
  are not supported (if the client sends you a product or cart, the message will not
  reach the CRM); The maximum size of the in/out files is 37 MB; if the client sends
  several contact cards from his address book in a message, you won''t see this in
  the CRM (one contact card can be received); audio messages from the RadistWeb LRC
  do not reach their recipients, although they are marked as delivered.'
- Duplicate control is configured separately for each integration.
- The fields are filled in only when the leade is created for the first time. If the
  visitor writes to you again, and the lead with them in Kommo already exists, then

- In order for the fields in Kommo to be filled in, in the integration settings, the
  creation of leads must be configured in any status except Incoming Leads.
