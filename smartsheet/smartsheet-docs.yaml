notes:
- Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates.
- The callbackURL cannot be a private IP address.
- 'The callbackURL must use one of the following ports: 443 (default for HTTPS), 8000,
  8008, 8080, or 8443.'
- Authentication is performed with every API call by sending a header with your unique
  Brandfolder API key.
- Event Reporting is a premium add-on available for Enterprise and Advanced Work Management
  plans only.
- Each response to your API calls will only include the resources that you can access
  based on your permissions.
- We deprecated webhook traffic through specific known Smartsheet IP addresses.
- Allow-listing the domain webhooks.smartsheet.com is the recommended approach for
  future compatibility.
- The callback_url must be accessible from the public internet.
- Webhook subscriptions will be made inactive if they continue to fail.
