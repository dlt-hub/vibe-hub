  the Pentaho MapReduce entry to work.
- No specific authentication is required for API access.
- Metadata injection support
- Filters are used to restrict or limit data in a report.
- To make these types of changes, you must be assigned the Manage Data Sources operation
  permission in Users and Roles.
- When you are done designing the report and want to run it with the entire data set,
  you can generate the full report by simply scheduling the report to run.
- You can limit how often you query the data while building your report to help reduce
  the amount of time required to refresh the report.
- To meet your ETL service-level agreements (SLA), you may need a larger warehouse
  during the ETL process.
- You can use this entry with the Start Snowflake warehouse job entry to limit the
  run-time of your warehouse to reduce costs.
- For more information about using Snowflake, including best practices for suspending
  warehouses, see the Snowflake documentation.
- Uses Kerberos security for authentication.
- Cluster connection requires specific configuration.
- Maps are not supported for export to Excel.
