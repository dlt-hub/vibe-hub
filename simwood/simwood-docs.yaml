auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.simwood.com/docs/wholesale/api/v3/:
  - The API uses standard HTTP Basic Authentication for most endpoints that require
    authentication. Credentials should be sent in the Authorization header using the
    Basic scheme (base64-encoded username:password). Some endpoints like /v3/tools/myip
    and /v3/tools/time do not require authentication.
  - The API uses standard HTTP Basic Authentication. Include your API username and
    password in the Authorization header as a Base64-encoded string in the format
    "username:password", or use your HTTP client's built-in basic auth support (e.g.,
    curl --user, PHP CURLOPT_USERPWD). Your API username and password are separate
    from your portal login credentials and were provided when you created your Simwood
    account; contact support if you need them. These credentials grant full account
    access and cannot currently be changed by users.

  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (default 500, specifies maximum
    results to return) and start (optional offset for pagination). Construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the start parameter value based on previous response
    size.'

  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (default 500, specifies maximum
    results returned) and start (optional offset for pagination). To paginate, increment
    the start parameter by the limit value for each subsequent request.'
- information_source; https://developer.simwood.com/docs/direct/api/v1:
  - 'List resources support pagination via two query parameters: pageSize (number
    of items per page, default 20, maximum 200) and page (page number to return, default
    1). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter value.'
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with pageSize and page query parameters. The
    response includes a nextPage field containing the full URL for the next page of
    results.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageSize (page size) and page (page
    number, starting at 1). The response includes totalItems (total count), pageSize
    (returned page size), page (current page number), and items (array of results).
