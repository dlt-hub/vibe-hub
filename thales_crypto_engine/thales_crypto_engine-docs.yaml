auth_info:

  - 'The API requires authentication credentials passed in JSON request bodies using
    password-based authentication. Two authentication types are supported: "PO" (Primary
    Owner) and "CO" (Cluster Owner). Credentials are submitted as objects within "migratingAuthentication",
    "clusterAuthentication", or "authentication" arrays in the request body, each
    containing a "type" field (either "PO" or "CO") and a "password" field with the
    plaintext password value.'
  - 'The API requires two sets of credentials in the request body for partition object
    migration: migratingPartitionCoAuth and keyringCoAuth, each containing a type
    field set to "CO" and a password field with the respective partition and keyring
    CO (Crypto Officer) passwords. Up to 1000 objects can be migrated per request
    by including their OUIDs in the objectID array, and the target keyring is specified
    via the keyringId UUID parameter.'
  - The authentication for cluster migration operations uses role-based credentials
    sent in JSON request bodies. Provide an authentication array with type field set
    to either "CO" (Crypto Officer) or "PO" (Partition Officer) and corresponding
    password field. For ending migration, include migratingAuthentication array with
    both PO and CO credentials, each as separate objects with type and password fields.

  : - Users must have Admin privileges to perform this command. The command requires
      authentication via Crypto Officer (CO) and Partition SO (PSO) passwords for
      both the source partition and cluster partition, provided via the -copassword,
      -popassword, -clusterco, and -clusterpo arguments respectively, or entered interactively
      when not specified.

  - Log in as HSM SO using POST /api/lunasa/hsms/{hsmid}/login endpoint. The CO must
    change the initial password/PED key before performing other actions when "Force
    user PIN change after set/reset" policy is enabled (default). An authorization
    code from Thales is required for package verification.

  : - 'Pagination is controlled by two optional parameters: startIndex (query parameter
      specifying the index position to begin listing from, default 0) and maxEntries
      (query parameter specifying the number of objects to include, valid range 1-4294967295,
      defaults to all objects if omitted). Stop paginating when fewer objects are
      returned than maxEntries or when startIndex exceeds available objects.'
