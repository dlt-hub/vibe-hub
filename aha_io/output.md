In this guide, we'll set up a complete Aha! data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def aha_roadmaps_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://<yourcompany>.aha.io/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "/privacy/personal_information",
            "/privacy/subprocessors",
            "/api/issues"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='aha_roadmaps_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='aha_roadmaps_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(aha_roadmaps_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from aha_roadmaps‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Privacy Management: Manage and access personal data and subprocessor information.
- Issue Tracking: Retrieve issues relating to product development.
- User Stories: Access user stories for agile development tracking.
- Product Development: Access steps and frameworks associated with product development processes.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Aha! workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@aha_roadmaps-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Aha! support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:aha_roadmaps duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@aha_roadmaps-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Aha! API, as specified in @aha_roadmaps-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "/privacy/personal_information" and "/privacy/subprocessors" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in aha_roadmaps_pipeline.py and name the pipeline aha_roadmaps_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python aha_roadmaps_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed via OAuth2, using an authorization code flow. A client ID, client secret, and token URL are required. Tokens must be included in the header for requests.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.aha.io/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python aha_roadmaps_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline aha_roadmaps load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset aha_roadmaps_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/aha_roadmaps.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline aha_roadmaps_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("aha_roadmaps_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "/privacy/personal_information" table as Pandas frame
   data."/privacy/personal_information".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Before using the API, an external application must be registered with Aha!. The user must be a valid Aha! user and a workspace owner in Aha! Roadmaps. Integration with Azure DevOps requires appropriate permissions. A high-speed Internet connection is necessary for proper API function. Aha! adheres to strict privacy policies, especially concerning California users.
