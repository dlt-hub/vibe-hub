notes:
- Released under the MIT License.
- Requires a database session to access crime data
- Uses JWT for authentication — requires setup of user model and registration endpoint
- Batman decided to implement monitoring and logging.
- He used a third-party library to integrate logging middleware.
- Robyn supports Jinja2 templates by default but provides an easy way to add other
  templating engines as well.
- Use a real database in production
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous requests
- Robyn provides an easy way to add an authentication middleware to your application.
- WebSocket connections are automatically accepted - no need to call accept()!
- WebSocket connections are automatically accepted in Robyn - no need to call `accept()`.
- WebSocket connections are automatically accepted.
- Supports dependency injection for WebSocket handlers.
- router_dependencies, global_dependencies are reserved parameters and must be named
  as such.
- MCP runs at /mcp endpoint using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP. No additional setup required.
- AI features are included with the base Robyn installation.
- The in-memory provider loses data when the application restarts.
- Robyn is designed to scale efficiently from development to production.
- Uses Docker for consistent environments and easy scaling
- Health check configured for application monitoring
- Start simple during development with auto-reload enabled.
- Use multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- Robyn uses a shared-nothing multi-process model optimized for modern multi-core
  systems.
- Each process has its own Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), eliminating GIL contention.
- Use environment variables for deployment flexibility
- Robyn supports comprehensive timeout configuration to handle high-concurrency scenarios
  and prevent resource exhaustion like the 'Too many open files' error.
- This will use ROBYN_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=60 if set, otherwise 30
- Robyn automatically injects request components based on function signatures.
- Perfect for health checks, static configuration
- Robyn supports multiple types of path parameters with flexible matching patterns.
- Routes are matched in the order they're registered.
- Robyn's routing system includes sophisticated parameter injection, route optimization,
  and flexible pattern matching.
- Robyn's routing system includes sophisticated parameter injection and route optimization.
- Robyn integrates with Python's asyncio while maintaining Rust's async runtime
- Workers share the same Python interpreter but handle requests concurrently
- Robyn is a Python web server that employs the tokio runtime and leverages a blend
  of Python and Rust, enabling efficient request handling through a worker event cycle,
  multi-core scaling, and introducing 'Const Requests' for optimized, cached responses
  in a multi-threaded environment.
- Robyn is a Python web server that employs the tokio runtime and leverages a blend
  of Python and Rust, enabling efficient request handling through a worker event cycle.
- Each worker process is capable of managing multiple threads, allowing for efficient
  concurrent processing.
- The number of worker processes can be configured using the --processes flag, with
  a default of 1.
- Robyn provides a development mode that can be activated using the --dev flag.
- In development mode, multi-process and multi-worker configurations are disabled
  to ensure consistent behavior.
- Robyn is able to serve the 10k requests in 1.8 seconds followed by Flask and FastAPI,
  which take around 5 seconds(using 5 workers on a dual-core machine). Finally, Django
  takes around 13.5070 seconds.
- The easiest way to get up and running is to have your application listen on 0.0.0.0:$PORT,
  where PORT is a Railway-provided environment variable.
- 此插件使您能够为 Robyn 应用程序的路由实现限流功能。
