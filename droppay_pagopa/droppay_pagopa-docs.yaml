auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.drop-pay.com/API/Payments/pagopa-v3/:
  - Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    The token format is "Bearer {token_value}" where the token is a 32-character alphanumeric
    string like "ac9185e9f2984867b11069fd2881ff1a".
  - Bearer token authentication is required, sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}". The token format appears to be a 32-character alphanumeric string (e.g.,
    ac9185e9f2984867b11069fd2881ff1a).
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the authorization header with
    the value "Bearer" followed by an access token (e.g., "Bearer ac9185e9f2984867b11069fd2881ff1a").
    The token must be passed in the Authorization request header.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}". Example: Authorization: Bearer ac9185e9f2984867b11069fd2881ff1a'
  - 'Requests must be authenticated using a User Access Token sent in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The User Access Token is obtained by requesting it with
    an active Connection Code, as detailed in the Authentication v.1 API Reference.
    The header format is: Authorization: Bearer <token_value>.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.drop-pay.com/API/Bank-v1/push/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pg_num (page number, required) and pg_size (page
    size, required, default 100). Response includes paging_info object with current_page,
    total_pages, page_size, total_items, and items_offset fields to track pagination
    state and determine when to stop (when current_page reaches total_pages minus
    one).
  - Pagination uses query parameters pg_num (page number, required, starts at 0) and
    pg_size (page size, required, default 100) to control which page of results to
    retrieve. The response includes a pushes array containing the paginated results.
  - The response includes pagination metadata in the paging_info object with current_page,
    total_pages, page_size, total_items, and items_offset fields. However, no request
    parameters for controlling pagination (such as page, limit, or offset query parameters)
    are documented in the provided excerpt, so the mechanism for requesting specific
    pages cannot be determined from this documentation chunk.
- information_source; https://developers.drop-pay.com/API/Bank-v1/pull/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pg_num (page number, required, default 0) and
    pg_size (page size, required, default 100). The response includes a paging_info
    object with current_page field to track position. Use pg_num to navigate pages
    sequentially.
- information_source; https://developers.drop-pay.com/API/Bank-v1/ISO-20022-v1/camt052001/:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pg_num and pg_size to control page number
    and page size (default pg_size is 100, pg_offset is 0). The response includes
    a camt052s array with job objects; continue paginating by incrementing pg_num
    until no more results are returned.
