auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.intelepeer.com/Atmosphere/Content/Atmosphere-SMS-Messaging/Using-the-SMS-API-from-the-Atmosphere-Portal.htm
  : - To use the SMS/MMS API, you must first generate an authentication token by calling
      the IntelePeer Authentication API with your CPaaS Portal credentials (username
      and password). All subsequent API requests must include this Authorization token
      in the request headers. The token is obtained from the API Authentication endpoint
      and is required for access to send SMS/MMS, receive SMS/MMS webhooks, and check
      message status.
- information_source; https://docs.intelepeer.com/Atmosphere/Content/Atmosphere-APIs/Authentication.htm:
  - Authentication uses username and password credentials sent as JSON in the request
    body to a POST endpoint at https://api.intelepeer.com/_rest/v4/app/sms/authenticate/get_portal_auth_token,
    which returns a token in the JSON response under the key 'token'. The request
    requires Content-Type and Accept headers set to application/json.
  - 'Authentication uses username and password credentials sent in a JSON request
    body to a token endpoint. The API returns a token in the response that should
    be extracted and used for subsequent requests.


    Endpoint: POST https://api.intelepeer.com/_rest/v4/app/sms/authenticate/get_portal_auth_token


    Request body fields: username, password


    Response field: token (extract this value from the JSON response)


    Content-Type header: application/json


    Accept header: application/json'
  - 'Authentication uses username and password credentials sent in the request body
    to the /authenticate endpoint. A successful POST request returns a token in the
    response body that is used for subsequent API calls.


    Endpoint: POST https://customer.intelepeer.com/_rest/v4/authenticate


    Request body (JSON): username and password fields with user credentials.


    Response on success (HTTP 200): token field containing the authentication token.


    Headers required: Content-Type: application/json and Accept: application/json.


    HTTP 401 response indicates unauthorized access, typically due to incorrect credentials
    or user lacking API access permissions in the Customer Portal.'
  - The API uses basic username and password authentication. Send a POST request to
    the authentication endpoint with a JSON body containing "username" and "password"
    fields, and include Content-Type and Accept headers set to application/json. The
    response will provide an authentication token for subsequent API calls.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.intelepeer.com/Atmosphere/Content/Atmosphere-SMS-Messaging/SMS-APIs/SMS-Message-Management.htm
  : - To send an SMS with delivery receipts, use the POST endpoint with optional dlr
      parameter set to true. The dlroptions object allows configuring additional DLR
      behavior, including include-accepted to generate an intermediary DLR when the
      message is enqueued into the SMS network.
- ? information_source; https://docs.intelepeer.com/Atmosphere/Content/Atmosphere-APIs/Voice-APIs/Toll-Free-Number-Management.htm
  : - The API uses offset-based pagination with page and pageSize query parameters.
      The page parameter (optional, default 1) specifies which page to retrieve, while
      pageSize (optional, default 100, range 1-250) controls results per page. The
      response includes an endpoints array; pagination continues by incrementing the
      page parameter until fewer than pageSize results are returned.
    - 'pageSize is an optional query parameter (default: 100, max: 100, min: 1) controlling
      results per page. When more records are available, the API returns pageSize
      + 1 records to indicate a next page exists, though no explicit next page token
      or continuation mechanism is documented.'
