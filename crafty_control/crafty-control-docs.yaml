notes:
- Crafty is currently tested on and works running MC Java versions 1.8 - latest
- Versions older than 1.8 are not supported - run them at your own risk.
- The Super user option is only displayed if the user creating a new user account
  is a Super User.
- Be cautious when modifying the Server Execution Command and ensure that you refer
  to the specific .bat or .sh file provided by the installer to extract the correct
  information.
- Crafty's minimum supported python version is 3.9.
- Running a public-facing web application with root privileges can pose significant
  security risks.
- We do not support Docker for Windows!
- Docker on Windows has a known issue with volume permissions that can destroy Minecraft
  world.
- If you are using Docker for Windows it is unsupported, ⚠️Proceed at your own risk⚠️
- Assumes you have a decent understanding of a Linux environment and are comfortable
  with the command line.
- Assumes you will be installing Crafty into /var/opt/minecraft/crafty.
- Assumes your server will be at /var/opt/minecraft/server.
- Assumes the user account running crafty will have full read/write/execute permissions
  on these folders.
- Requirements include Windows 10 or 11 and .NET 8 or Higher
- Auto-update feature can be enabled in the configuration
- You will need brew.sh installed in your mac.
- This guide assumes you have a decent understanding of the macOS Terminal environment
  and are comfortable with the command line.
- This guide also assumes you will be installing Crafty into /var/opt/minecraft/crafty.
- We also assume your server will be at /var/opt/minecraft/server.
- We also assume the user account running crafty will have full read/write/execute
  permissions on these folders.
- 'Finally this guide assumes you have the following software installed and up to
  date: Git, Python 3.9+.'
- Crafty will require various ports to be exposed to be able to be accessible.
- Crafty makes use of WSS. Proper configurations are needed for reverse proxies to
  support WSS.
- Some AD blockers will block WSS connections.
- MFA adds a second factor of authentication, ensuring that only authorized users
  with both the correct password and a unique one-time code can access Crafty.
- 'Common MFA errors: “Invalid code” “Code expired” could relate to time-sync issues.'
- Due to Linux permissions you will not be able to import a server unless it has the
  file permissions mask/file ownership set correctly, otherwise Crafty essentially
  can't see it!
- 'Docker/UnRAID Users - Import Location/Permissions: The only directory you can import
  servers from is the `/import` mount.'
- Standard users cannot change storage location; only 'Super Users' can set a custom
  path.
- While there are minimal configuration options available for this panel, it provides
  valuable information at a glance.
- It's important to note a known issue where zooming out on the graph with large datasets
  may cause performance issues due to unpruned point data.
- The task scheduler allows you to automate tasks such as backups, running commands,
  and more.
- You can chain tasks together based on the success of a parent task.
- Server re-ordering is only supported on desktop.
- Be mindful of the rate limits imposed by the services you are integrating with.
