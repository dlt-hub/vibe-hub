auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.vitally.io/en/articles/9880649-rest-api-overview:
  - A 401 Unauthorized status code indicates an issue with authorization using either
    a Secret Token or Basic Auth Header. The documentation references these two auth
    methods but does not provide explicit details on header names, parameter names,
    or how to construct the credentials. Based on the mention of "Secret Token/Basic
    Auth Header", the API likely accepts either a bearer token in an Authorization
    header or HTTP Basic Authentication, but the exact implementation details are
    not specified in this excerpt.
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API Key as the username. The Authorization
    header must be formatted as `Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_api_key>`, where
    the API key is obtained from the Vitally UI under Settings > Integrations > REST
    API. The API key serves as the username in the basic auth scheme, with an empty
    password.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.vitally.io/en/articles/9880649-rest-api-overview:
  - Cursor-based pagination uses query parameters limit (optional, controls page size)
    and from (optional, cursor for subsequent pages), with optional sortBy parameter
    set to "createdAt" or "updatedAt" (default descending). Response includes results
    array and next field (string cursor or null when no more pages); use next value
    as from parameter in subsequent requests to paginate.
  - List endpoints use cursor-based pagination ordered by updatedAt (default) or createdAt.
    The documentation mentions cursor-based pagination but does not specify the exact
    cursor parameter names, response field names, or how to construct subsequent requests.
  - 'Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with optional limit parameter. Request
    parameters: limit (query, optional, default/max 100) and from (query, optional
    cursor). Response includes results array and next field containing the cursor
    for the next page; when next is null, pagination is complete. Use the next cursor
    value as the from parameter in the subsequent request.'
- information_source; https://docs.vitally.io/en/articles/9880652-rest-api-organizations:
  - Pagination uses limit and from parameters. The limit parameter controls page size,
    and from parameter accepts a cursor value to fetch subsequent pages. Response
    includes a cursor field for constructing the next request.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (controls page size) and from
    (cursor-based token for fetching subsequent pages). Response includes results
    array and next field containing the cursor for the next page; when next is absent,
    all data has been retrieved.'
