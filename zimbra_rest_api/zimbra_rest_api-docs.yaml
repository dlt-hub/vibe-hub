auth_info:
- information_source; https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_REST_API_Reference:
  - The API supports multiple authentication methods via the `auth=` parameter. Default
    behavior is `auth=co,nsc,qp`, which checks for cookie auth token first, then additional
    methods. Authentication can be designated to control how users are authenticated
    when accessing a mailbox, including whether to set the authentication cookie.
