auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/authentication:
  - Polymarket CLOB uses two-tier authentication. Level 1 requires EIP-712 typed data
    signing with address, timestamp, nonce, and message fields. Level 2 uses API key
    authentication where credentials (key, secret, passphrase) are generated via POST
    /auth/api-key using the signature as a seed; the key and passphrase are sent with
    requests while the secret generates HMACs for request authentication.
