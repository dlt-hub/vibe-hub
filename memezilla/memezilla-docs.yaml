notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The model is released under the MIT license, which includes the source code, pretrained
  models, and an interactive online demo.
- Ripl is currently in the early stages of development and, as a result, not yet published
  to NPM.
- Most tools work on the client side for instant results.
- Some tools require server-side processing.
- Some tools may require server processing.
- Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.
- Run npm ci to strictly do a clean install of your dependencies matching package.json
  and package-lock.json.
- A flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND
  from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config
  is hierarchical for easier findability (d) typing support (e) validation for failing
  fast (f) Specify default for each key.
- QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently
  in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might
  run different code.
- Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns.
- Prefer const over let. Ditch the var.
- Avoid effects outside of functions.
- Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do – obviously this
  should be assigned unprecedented importance.
- DOS attacks are very popular and relatively easy to conduct. Implement rate limiting
  using an external service such as cloud load balancers, cloud firewalls, nginx,
  rate-limiter-flexible package, or (for smaller and less critical apps) a rate-limiting
  middleware (e.g. express-rate-limit)
- Never store plain-text secrets in configuration files or source code. Instead, make
  use of secret-management systems like Vault products, Kubernetes/Docker Secrets,
  or using environment variables.
- To prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and other malicious attacks, always make use of an
  ORM/ODM or a database library that escapes data or supports named or indexed parameterized
  queries.
- This is a collection of security advice that is not related directly to Node.js
  - the Node implementation is not much different than any other language.
- Your application should be using secure headers to prevent attackers from using
  common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other malicious
  attacks.
- Dependencies should always be kept in check as new vulnerabilities are found. Use
  tools like npm audit or snyk to track, monitor and patch vulnerable dependencies.
- Passwords or secrets (e.g. API keys) should be stored using a secure hash + salt
  function like bcrypt,scrypt, or worst case pbkdf2.
- Untrusted data that is sent down to the browser might get executed instead of just
  being displayed, this is commonly referred as a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack.
- Validate the incoming requests' body payload and ensure it meets expectations, fail
  fast if it doesn't.
- When using JSON Web Tokens (for example, with Passport.js), by default there's no
  mechanism to revoke access from issued tokens.
- 'A simple and powerful technique is to limit authorization attempts using two metrics:
  The first is number of consecutive failed attempts by the same user unique ID/name
  and IP address.'
- There is a common scenario where Node.js runs as a root user with unlimited permissions.
  It's recommended to create a non-root user.
- The bigger the body payload is, the harder your single thread works in processing
  it. This is an opportunity for attackers to bring servers to their knees without
  tremendous amount of requests (DOS/DDOS attacks).
- Avoid JavaScript eval statements to prevent security concerns
- Regular Expressions can pose a threat to performance and security
- Avoid dynamic module loading with user input to prevent security risks
- Run unsafe code in a sandbox to isolate execution environments
- Be cautious when working with child processes to avoid command injection
- Hide error details from clients to protect sensitive information
- Configure 2FA for npm or Yarn to enhance security
- Modify session middleware settings to prevent framework identification
- Prevent DOS attacks by setting conditions for process crashes
- Validate user input to prevent unsafe redirects
- Precautions should be taken to avoid the risk of accidentally publishing secrets
  to public npm registries. An .npmignore file can be used to ignore specific files
  or folders, or the files array in package.json can act as an allow list.
- Your project's API keys, passwords or other secrets are open to be abused by anyone
  who comes across them, which may result in financial loss, impersonation, and other
  risks.
- Some objects like Milestone may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This repository was created with the intention of helping developers master their
  concepts in JavaScript.
- Wireit upgrades your npm scripts to make them smarter and more efficient.
- Add .wireit to your .gitignore file.
- Paths should always use / (forward-slash) delimiters, even on Windows.
- Whenever a directory is matched, all recursive children of that directory are included.
- Symlinks in input files are followed, so that they are identified by their content.

- Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication library for TypeScript

- Allows for manipulation of element's class content attribute as a set of whitespace-separated
  tokens through a DOMTokenList object.
- The Monaco Editor is generated straight from VS Code's sources with some shims around
  services the code needs to make it run in a web browser outside of its home.
- HTML5 does not allow pages loaded on `file://` to create web workers. Please load
  the editor with a web server on `http://` or `https://` schemes.
- micromark is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
- It’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens.
- micromark lets you change markdown syntax, yes, but there are alternatives.
- Many micromark and remark users have asked about their unique goals for markdown.
- HTML extensions are not always needed, as micromark is often used through mdast-util-from-markdown
  to parse to a markdown syntax tree.
- micromark passes all tests from CommonMark and has many more tests to match the
  CommonMark reference parsers.
- Markdown itself is safe if it does not include embedded HTML or dangerous protocols
  in links/images.
- A production-grade, monorepo-first, full stack Next.js template.
