auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.channelape.com/api/:
  - JWT token passed as a query parameter named jwt for authentication. Include the
    jwt query parameter with your token value when making requests to this endpoint.
  - JWT token required in request body as a field named jwt with string value type.
  - The API uses JWT token-based authentication. Call the login_api_account RPC endpoint
    with required query parameters account_id (UUID) and secret (text) to obtain a
    JWT token valid for 4 hours. Use the returned token in subsequent requests as
    a bearer token in the Authorization header.
- information_source; https://dev.channelape.com/docs/api-usage/:
  - 'The API uses dual authentication: an `apikey` header with the public ANON_KEY
    (required on all requests), and an optional `Authorization` header with a Bearer
    token containing a JWT associated with your username or API account (required
    for business-specific endpoints). Without the Authorization header, requests are
    treated as anonymous.'
  - 'The API uses multiple authentication methods. First, an anonymous API key (ANON_KEY)
    is required in the "apikey" header for initial account creation and login requests.
    To obtain a long-lived credential, you create an API account which generates a
    private key (shown once), then use that key''s account_id and secret in a POST
    request to the login endpoint to receive a short-lived JWT (4 hour expiration).
    Subsequently, use the JWT in the "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" header for authenticated
    requests. JWTs must be refreshed before expiration.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.channelape.com/api/:
  - Pagination is supported through offset and limit query parameters for limiting
    and paging results, and optionally through Range and Prefer headers where Range
    specifies the item range and Prefer with count=none/estimated/exact controls count
    behavior.
  - 'Pagination is supported via offset and limit query parameters for limiting and
    paginating results, with Range and Prefer headers available for additional pagination
    control. The Range header with Range-Unit (default: items) enables range-based
    pagination, and the Prefer header with count=none option allows controlling response
    metadata.'
  - 'Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters for controlling page position
    and size, with a Range header supporting range-based requests (Range-Unit default:
    items). The Prefer header with count=none/estimated/exact controls count behavior
    in responses.'
  - 'Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters for controlling page position
    and size. The Range header with Range-Unit (default: items) and Prefer header
    (value: count=none) provide additional pagination control, with response samples
    available in multiple formats including JSON and CSV.'
  - 'Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters for controlling result position
    and count. The Range header with Range-Unit (default: items) provides alternative
    pagination control, and the Prefer header with count=none option affects response
    metadata.'
