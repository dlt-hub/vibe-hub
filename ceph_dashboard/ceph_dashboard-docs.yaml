auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/mgr/ceph_api/:
  - Authentication is performed by including an api_key parameter in the JSON request
    body. The api_key field is required and should contain the Ceph tracker API key
    credentials.
  - Authentication uses username and password credentials posted to the POST /api/auth
    endpoint, which returns a bearer token. This token must be included in the Authorization
    HTTP header as "Bearer <token>" with every subsequent API request.
  - The API requires authentication before access. A 401 Unauthorized response indicates
    unauthenticated access and a 403 Forbidden response indicates insufficient permissions.
    However, the specific authentication mechanism (e.g., header name, token format,
    or login endpoint) is not documented in the provided text.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Credentials are obtained by POSTing
    username and password to /api/auth endpoint as JSON, then the returned token is
    sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for subsequent requests.
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Clients must provide an authentication
    token via the query parameter named token when making requests to protected endpoints.
    A POST endpoint at /api/auth/check?token=string is available to verify token validity,
    and requests without valid authentication will receive 401 Unauthorized responses.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/mgr/ceph_api/:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters as integers. The offset parameter
    specifies the starting position and limit specifies the maximum number of results
    to return per request.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset is an integer specifying
    the starting position, and limit is an integer specifying the number of results
    to return per request. Use these parameters to retrieve successive pages of Rbd
    images.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (integer), and limit specifies the maximum number of results to return
    (integer). No response fields indicating pagination state or stopping conditions
    are documented.
  - The GET /api/host endpoint uses offset and limit query parameters for pagination.
    The offset parameter specifies the starting position and limit specifies the number
    of results per page, both as integers. Stop paginating when fewer results than
    the limit are returned or when no more data is available.
