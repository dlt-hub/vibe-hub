notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Provides ways of making assertions about object equality.
- Detailed output for complex data types when comparisons fail.
- Some objects, such as those from the Django ORM, have pretty broken implementations
  of `__eq__`.
- Comparisons should not be used on both sides of an equality check.
- Make sure you replace the object where it’s used and not where it’s defined.
- You can’t replace whole top level modules, and nor should you want to!
- Using specialized mock objects can have intricacies.
- Be aware that the date() method of mock_datetime instances will still return a normal
  date instance.
- Captures output sent to sys.stdout and sys.stderr
- Uses TempDirectory class to manage temporary files and directories
- You must be using Sybil version 6 or newer to use this parser.
- Provides methods for managing temporary directories in tests.
- Compatible with various testing frameworks.
- Must be using Sybil version 6 or newer to use this parser.
- Recommended to use the context manager rather than the decorator in most cases.
- Testfixtures has tools that make it easy to make assertions about code that may
  emit warnings.
- The registered comparer currently ignores many to many fields.
- Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported version.
- A `show_whitespace` parameter has been added to [`ShouldAssert`](api.html#testfixtures.ShouldAssert
  "testfixtures.ShouldAssert").
- testfixtures is now fully typed, checked with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  and is distributed with a `py.typed` marker file.
- Added the suffix parameter to compare() to allow failure messages to include some
  additional context.
- Update package metadata to indicate Python 3.5 compatibility.
