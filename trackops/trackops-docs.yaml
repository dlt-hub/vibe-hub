auth_info:

  - Basic HTTP authentication using username and API token. Credentials are sent in
    the Authorization header using the format `{username}/token:{api_token}` with
    the `-u` flag in curl, which translates to a Basic auth header with base64-encoded
    credentials in the format `username/token:api_token`.
  - The Trackops API uses HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL only. Authentication
    requires a specially formatted username as "{username}/token" paired with an API
    token in the Authorization header. The credentials are sent as basic auth in the
    format "{username}/token:{api_token}", where {username} is a Full Access employee
    account and {api_token} is obtained from your account's API Token settings. SSL
    connections are mandatory; non-SSL requests are rejected.

  - Use the page parameter to jump to a specific page of results. All collection queries
    recognize per_page, page, and dir parameters. When records returned are less than
    per_page or the collection is empty, there are no more records to fetch. Stop
    paginating when the response contains fewer records than the per_page value.
