notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Feathery
- API connector requests will always originate from 54.177.134.134, so you can whitelist
  this specific IP address on the recipient endpoint.
- Hidden fields are not visible to end users and can't be directly filled out from
  the form.
- Hidden fields can control behavior and run custom logic.
- Each Feathery field is available across all forms and integrations.
- Linked form fields share the same data but can be styled separately.
- Forms are by default responsive to different screen sizes
- Automatic tracking of a user's progress (data & location) for incomplete sessions
  and returns
- Document intelligence is available on the Business plan.
- Feathery supports complex form and document workflows involving multiple stakeholders
- The login token is valid for 24 hours and can be refreshed.
- You may either embed the Feathery editor into your custom app via an Iframe, or
  you can redirect your users to a new tab that loads a white label URL managed by
  Feathery.
- Some outdated browser versions can lead to SSL errors that prevent you from loading
  a Feathery form.
- An active Feathery account and form is required
- Form ID can be found on the form's settings page on the dashboard
- If you do not specify account credentials, a test account will be used by default.

  color selector.
- The Date Selector field allows users to choose a date from a visual interface.
- The date value gets stored in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- You can also configure the date selector to allow the user to pick a specific time
  of day. In that case, the entry is stored in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.
- The Email field allows users to enter a free-form email address.
- A badly formatted entry will trigger a validation error on submission and require
  the user to fix the entry.
- The Number field only accepts numbers as answers such as 1 or 1000. It will not
  accept non-numerical inputs.
- The password field allows users to securely enter a password, with custom requirements.
- The `Password` field collects a secure string that is encrypted visually and in
  Feathery storage.

  tab.
- Feathery supports powerful logic features that allow you to completely personalize
  your form experience.

  when the user interacts with your Feathery form.
- The rule logic you define will run on your end-user's browser.
- Only one promotion copy can be created for each form at a time.
- When promoting a form, the links to the form and submissions will be maintained.
- Once a form has a promotion copy attached, it can no longer have its own draft changes.
  All changes must be made on the promotion copy.
- You can stack promotions, meaning a promotable copy can have its own promotion copy.
- Only one version of the rollback is saved at a time. Each new promotion will overwrite
  the existing rollback with the most recent version.
- The Feathery City field allows users to enter the city of an autocompleted street
  address powered by Google Maps.

  step, this field will automatically populate with the city.
