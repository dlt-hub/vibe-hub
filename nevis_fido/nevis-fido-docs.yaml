notes:
- The long-term support life cycle is adapted for the upgrade from Java 8 to Java
  17.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Supports various authentication standards like FIDO UAF, FIDO2, OAuth 2.0, OpenID
  Connect, and SAML.
- New features are held back until a new major LTS release version is available
- Minor updates containing security patches and functional bug fixes are released
  every six months
- Learn more about the New LTS
- 'Identity Suite: New LTS-24 released! Learn more about the New LTS'
- Complies with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements and provides
  Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).
- Java 8 is no longer supported in new releases on the rolling release life cycle.
- The file-based OODC implementation in nevisAuth has been removed.
- We will release the first Nevis rolling release version with Java 17 in November
  2023.
- We will release the first Nevis long-term support version with Java 17 in May 2024.
- Technical support and minor updates for LTS-2021 will continue until November 2024
- The 2023-Q3 RR release has a special extended life cycle to facilitate the upgrade
  from Java 8 to Java 17.
- Support REST API calls with a JWT token when SAML is enabled.
- SOAP based nevisIdm connection is now removed and completely replaced by REST.
- If the classPath attribute is specified in the AuthEngine configuration, it has
  to contain the directory with the nevisFIDO AuthStates directory.
- Use a DirectResponseState AuthState as the AuthDone AuthState to make integration
  easier.
- Dispatchers are only used with Nevis Mobile Authentication, not FIDO2.
- Currently only HTTP is supported.
- The plug-in system and provided APIs are considered experimental.
- Plug-ins can be made available to nevisFIDO as java.util.ServiceLoader services.
- nevisFIDO currently does not audit into a separate audit log file.
- To support auditing scenarios it is recommended using the log4j2 configuration with
  fine-grained log levels (for example *DEBUG*).
- nevisFIDO currently does not inform FIDO clients about deregistered credentials,
  if the deregistration process was not initiated by the client itself.
- nevisFIDO does not support the Registration Counter (RegCounter) anti-fraud measure
  outlined in Anti-Fraud Signals.
- With the current dispatch target model in nevisIDM, it is not possible to identify
  which (FIDO) credentials belong to which device.
- Failed login attempts are tracked in step up scenarios, when the user is known at
  the time of authentication.
- Requires setup of connected app in nevisFIDO
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This is a technical release only.
- There are no changes or new features.
- The nevisFIDO component currently does not support the FIDO2 specification for extensions.
- The Status Service is not a standard FIDO2 / WebAuthn / Conformance API service
  but a proprietary nevisFIDO functionality.
- Several add-on patterns facilitate application protection.
- Example add-ons are Access Restriction and ICAP Scanning.
- All nevisIDM services require authentication.
- Further authentication use cases, such as login with mTAN, will be available in
  future releases.
- Requires setup of connected app in Nevis
- Keystores are used by Nevis components for secure endpoints (HTTPs / TLS), outbound
  connections (2-way TLS), and for signing tokens.
- Truststore must contain the CA (or a parent thereof) which has issued the certificate
  of the other party for trust validation.
- The Nevis OpenTelemetry agent also serves as a replacement for OpTrace.
- Uses bearer token for authentication
- The IP-to-location mapping update requires a download token generated by IP2LOCATION.
- For MaxMind, a license key generated by MaxMind is required.
- Patterns are used in nevisAdmin 4 to configure Nevis.
- If you use the extended version of the Geolocation database, it is recommended that
  you allocate at least 5 GB memory for the nevisAdapt service.
- The size of the database file should be less than 500 MB.
- To set up FIDO2 use cases we recommend using the patterns provided by nevisAdmin
  4.
- This chapter helps you to get started with nevisAdmin 4.
- With WebAuthn, you do not need an Access App or additional setup on the user side.
- Origins must be allowed for WebAuthn to be used in a secure context.
- You need a capable authenticator device that the browser can access.
- We recommend to run various tests in your device landscape to make sure that your
  systems are compatible with the devices of your users.
- 'Everything done right, upon startup, the nevisFIDO server should print this into
  the log (if UAF is enabled on the same server, it is also listed): INFO  c.n.a.fido.application.Application
  The following 1 profile is active: "fido2"'
- FIDO2 registration requires client side Javascript.
- User must perform legacy authentication before registration.
- Make sure to choose a step-up authentication flow to integrate into, and make sure
  the extId of the user is already loaded into the session.
- FIDO2 calls must come through nevisProxy, where the SecToken is delegated into the
  request
- The user's device and browser must support FIDO2.
- The user already has existing FIDO2 credentials which can be used to authenticate.
- Substitute nevisfido-host and nevisfido-port to point to your nevisFIDO instance.
- The FIDO2 calls of the FIDO2 Authentication Client Javascript must come through
  nevisProxy.
- 'The presence of discoverable credentials can be ensured by enforcing that during
  registration the ServerPublicKeyCredentialCreateOptionsRequest the FIDO2 Registration
  Client Javascript sends to nevisFIDO contains residentKey: "required".'
- Allow-listing is based on the Authenticator Attestation Global Unique Identifier
  (AAGUID) as well as the Attestation root certificate of the authenticator.
- The Registration options service attestation attribute must be set to direct.
- The authenticators supported attestation format must be Basic or AttCa.
- Passkeys are not supported as they don't provide attestation.
- Ensure the content-type of the response is application/json.
- The JSON document must have a member named origins, containing an array of valid
  origins for use with passkeys scoped for the RP ID.
- Nevis FIDO2 Authentication does not yet support the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service.
- Nevis FIDO2 does not yet support the fine-tuning of registration and authentication
  ceremonies with the AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria and the UserVerification objects
  respectively.
- Nevis FIDO2 relies on the WebAuthn specification, which defines how the client-side
  of the protocol must behave.
- Nevis recommends using the official MDS3 service for most use cases and scenarios.
- The metadata root certificate is required in the nevisFIDO configuration to ensure
  metadata endpoints are trusted.
- nevisIDM versions prior to 2.86.0.x require the unit policy to allow credential
  type 23 which represents the FIDO2 Authenticator or else FIDO2 operations will fail
  as the user won't be allowed to have the credential type.
- The server processed the request successfully. A ServerResponse JSON object is returned.
- The server will accept a divergence of 5 minutes for device signature.
- Do not use the Create Token Service for out-of-band scenarios.
- Requires a JSON payload with a specific structure including 'op' and 'context'.
- Only supports 'POST' as HTTP method.
- It is recommended to protect this service using a SecToken.
- Status Service is a public HTTP API to check the status of an operation for a user
  in nevisFIDO.
- No request headers must be set.
- The client can send ASM Status Code received by the ASM in the registration response.
- If an error occurs on the client side, the client may return a RegistrationResponse
  containing an empty assertions array.
- 'Content-Length: 3636'
- The server processed the request successfully. Check the response body for UAF specific
  status information.
