notes:
- Enhanced Security with OAuth2 Authentication
- EDI2XML implements enterprise-grade security with OAuth2 token-based authentication,
  HTTPS encryption for all communications, and secure token refresh mechanisms. Access
  tokens are valid for one hour.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Online EDI reduces time-to-live from weeks to days, freeing IT to focus on core
  applications rather than translation engines.
- Outsourcing integration ensures projects stay on time and on budget, reducing internal
  staffing overhead.
- On-premises EDI satisfies rigorous security requirements while leveraging proven
  ANSI X12 standards.
- Uses EDI via REST API for integration
- JDE Orchestrator was first introduced in 2015 as a tool for IoT integration
- Some features may require a higher tools release or patch level.
- For those who are considering using JDE Orchestrator’s capabilities but aren’t sure
  where to start or how to navigate the complexities, it’s essential to seek guidance
  from experienced professionals.
- Supports integration with various protocols and data formats
- Includes capabilities for data transformation
- Companies often face the challenge of integrating their EDI or eCommerce processes
  with Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.
- JDE Orchestrator is compatible with JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 9.1 and above.
- JDE does not have a seamless built-in integration with all EDI X12 documents out
  of the box.
- The current integration process for EDI X12, EDIFACT, HL7 or any other data format
  now happens by writing into transition tables (or Z files) and then triggering a
  business function to process those incoming data.
- Amazon highly recommends planning the migration process as soon as possible.
- 'OAuth2 Secure Authentication: All API access is now protected with secure OAuth2
  tokens, valid for 1 hour with refresh capability.'
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
