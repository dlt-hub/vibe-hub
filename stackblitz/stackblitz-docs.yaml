notes:
- 'Projects created with the template: ''node'' option will use the WebContainers
  environment.'
- Projects created with a different template value will use the EngineBlock environment.
- New projects are not persisted on StackBlitz, and only live in the browserâ€™s memory.
- StackBlitz Teams eliminates issues related to local development environments.
- EngineBlock supports only front-end frameworks; WebContainers support full-stack
  applications.
- Importing private GitHub repos is a feature available with memberships.
- Users may need to re-authorize to access GitHub repositories due to migration from
  OAuth app to GitHub App.
- You can customize your embed further by adding suitable query parameters.
- Keep the package-lock.json file to optimize the launching speed.
- Set up a simple URL that immediately opens the live environment.
- The SDK is a small package (just 2kb gzipped) intended to help in communication
  between your code and StackBlitz.
- The addon is compatible with all Storybook deployments including for Chromatic customers.
- No further configuration is needed if the user is logged in at GitHub and StackBlitz
  (in beta)
- During the early beta, Codeflow IDE currently does not persist changes between sessions.
- Installing CodeflowApp ensures every commit to default branch and any pull request
  branches are pre-cloned for instant bootup times.
- To disable the bot, create a `.stackblitz` folder in the root directory of the project
  and specify actions in `codeflow.json`.
- Safari currently doesn't support WebContainers
- Codeflow IDE is free for Open Source projects and for public repositories and will
  remain this way forever.
- You need to sign in to StackBlitz using GitHub.
- The Environment Variables feature provides secure storage for secrets, variables,
  API tokens, or system configuration details used in your projects.
- If your registry is behind a corporate firewall, than you will likely need StackBlitz
  Enterprise installed behind the corporate firewall/on-prem in order to access your
  private NPM registry.
- These methods only apply to projects embedded on a page.
- Binary files (such as archives or non-SVG images) are not supported for the dynamically
  created projects.
- WebContainers are supported in all recent desktop browsers (fully in Chrome and
  Chrome-based browsers, in beta in Firefox and Safari), and partially supported on
  Android browsers.
- If you enabled blocking third-party cookies in Chrome preferences, this may prevent
  WebContainers from working out of the box.
- Older Safari versions are not supported.
- Use of Service Workers and WebAssembly may be blocked by browser settings.
- Add exceptions for StackBlitz domains in cookie and popup settings.
- Turbo relies on the package-lock.json file format from npm to read and write lockfiles.
- Turbo has many settings that can be configured in .turborc.json.
- Currently, WebContainers can only execute languages that are natively supported
  on the Web, including JavaScript and WebAssembly.
- It is not possible to run native addons which are usually implemented using native
  languages such as C++, unless they can be compiled to WebAssembly.
- At this time, it is not possible to install your own Service Worker with WebContainer
  as our own Service Worker is used as a core component of the networking stack.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: wasm memory'
- Cannot load native addon because loading addons is disabled
- 'code ERESOLVE: Conflicting peer dependency'
