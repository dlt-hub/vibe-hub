notes:
- 'Proposed route for bulk deletion of JWT credentials: DELETE /consumers/:consumerId/jwt'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- If I use the short name (postgresql), it does not work
- If I use the FQDN (postgresql.something.whatever), it works
- CoreDNS resolution works fine, so the issue is not here.
- Uses a queuing mechanism to send logs asynchronously
- When using Kong Konnect, the Admin API isn’t served on the same machine as the dataplane.
- Kong isn’t built to play well with UIs and redirects.
- Usage of the `preserve_host` attribute enables to keep the external Host in the
  Location redirect header.
- If the results fit within one page, all the results are in that page
- If the results don’t fit within one page, you’ll get some of the results, and the
  returned JSON will include a 'next' key
