auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/95128671/Working+with+alert+definitions+using+the+API:
  - Alerts use a token-based authentication scheme where credentials are passed via
    the standAloneToken header. Include the header standAloneToken with your authentication
    token value in each API request.
  - Devo alerts use a standAloneToken authentication scheme. Include the token in
    the request header with the key "standAloneToken" set to your token value. The
    token is passed as a custom header in all API requests.
  - 'standAloneToken header authentication. Send your token in the standAloneToken
    header with each request to the alerts API endpoints. Example: --header ''standAloneToken:YOUR_TOKEN'''
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/101220364/Activeboards+API:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Enter your Devo token in the Authorization
    header using Bearer Token auth type (Authorization: Bearer <your_devo_token>).
    The token can be obtained from your Devo account settings.'
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/94652233:
  - Queries made using the Query API are secured using token-based authorization with
    API keys. Data transmission to Devo cloud uses TLS 1.3 encryption and mutual authentication.
    Web application access requires password-based authentication, with optional SAML,
    OpenID, and MFA protocols available for domain administrators to implement.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/95128671/Working+with+alert+definitions+using+the+API:
  - page (number, query parameter, optional) and size (number, query parameter, optional)
    are used for pagination. The page parameter specifies which group to retrieve,
    and size specifies how many alerts per page. The documentation appears incomplete
    regarding default values, maximum limits, and response fields indicating total
    pages or whether more data exists.
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/184975441:
  - The API uses limit, orderBy, and datetime filters for pagination. When the limit
    is reached, the collector removes events with the last datetime value and resubmits
    the request using that datetime as the new start_date (inclusive) with the same
    end_date. If all returned events share the same datetime and the limit is reached,
    the collector increments start_date by one second. Pagination stops when the limit
    is not reached in a response.
  - Use query parameters page (page number) and per_page (results per page limit)
    in the GET request to paginate Cloudflare Audit Logs. The response indicates which
    page is returned; continue requesting with incremented page values until no more
    results are available.
- information_source; https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/184975456:
  - The Mimecast API uses page_token as an optional pagination parameter. Pass a pagination
    token from a previous response as the page_token parameter to resume fetching
    data from a specific page. The documentation does not specify the response field
    containing the next token or stopping conditions.
