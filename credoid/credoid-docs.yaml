    with username and password in the JSON body to receive a token. Then, include
    this token in the Authorization header for subsequent API calls.
  - The CredoID API uses JWT bearer token authentication. To authenticate, send a
    POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint with a JSON body containing username
    and password fields. The response provides a JWT bearer token that must be included
    in the Authorization header for all subsequent API calls.
