auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.smsapi.com/blog/send-sms-with-php-library/:
  - The API requires bearer token authentication. Pass your access token as the `%SMSAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN%`
    environment variable or configuration value, which is then used to authenticate
    requests to https://api.smsapi.com via the SmsapiClient service.
- information_source; https://www.smsapi.com/docs:
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication. Send the OAuth token in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer token_api_oauth". The token must
    be obtained through an OAuth2 flow prior to making API calls.'
  - Access token passed as a parameter during client initialization. The Python client
    accepts an access_token parameter (e.g., from environment variable SMSAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN).
    The Java OAuthClient accepts an OAuth token string directly in its constructor.
    Send the token via the client initialization; the underlying implementation handles
    adding it to request headers.
  - 'Authentication uses OAuth2 bearer tokens passed via the Authorization header
    or as an access_token query parameter. The token value is obtained from the OAuth
    management portal at https://ssl.smsapi.com/react/oauth/manage.


    For HTTP requests, include either Authorization: Bearer token_api_oauth in the
    header, or add access_token=token_api_oauth as a query parameter in the request
    URL.'
  - 'Authentication uses OAuth2 bearer tokens. The token must be passed in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer token_api_oauth" where token_api_oauth is the
    OAuth2 access token.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.smsapi.com/docs/:
  - The documentation shows a price list endpoint with a limit query parameter. The
    limit parameter accepts the value ALL to retrieve all results, suggesting pagination
    support through limit-based control, though specific pagination response fields
    or navigation mechanisms are not explicitly described in the provided excerpt.
