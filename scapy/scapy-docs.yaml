notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Root privileges are needed to send the packets.
- Uses native sockets by default on Unix/OSX, and winpcap/npcap on Windows
- Traceroute results can be visualized in a graph.
- Requires ImageMagick for graph visualization.
- On Windows and OSX, you will need to also use monitor=True, which only works on
  scapy>2.4.0 (2.4.0dev+). This might require you to manually toggle monitor mode.
- Uses TCP traceroute function to send multiple packets simultaneously.
- Scapy's interactive shell requires root privileges to send packets.
- Scapy can send and receive packets at different layers (Layer 2 and Layer 3).
- To use libpcap on Unix/OSX, ensure you have libpcap installed.
- Supports multi-target traceroute with simultaneous packet sending
- Scapy is not designed to be blazing fast, but rather easily hackable & extensible.
- The packet model makes it VERY easy to create new layers, compared to pretty much
  all other alternatives, but comes with a performance cost.
- You can use a BPF filter to speed up dissection.
- You can disable layers you don’t use for a performance boost.
- Root privileges are needed to send the packets, so we’re using `sudo` here.
- On Windows, please open a command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and make sure that you have
  administrator privileges.
- Requires setup for geoip2 and cartopy for graphical outputs.
- Asynchronous sniffing is only available since Scapy 2.4.3
- 'The inner workings of Session is currently UNSTABLE: custom Sessions may break
  in the future.'
- Uses hexadecimal and binary string representations for packet data.
- Some features may not be available if optional packages are not installed.
- Uses Scapy for packet manipulation and scanning
- Sniffing can be done on specified interfaces or default interface
- Asynchronous sniffing does not necessarily improves performance.
- When sniffing on several interfaces, you can check what interface a packet was sniffed
  on.
- Supports packet sniffing and analysis.
- Scapy takes ages to start because you have very big routing tables.
- Disable the auto-loading of the routing tables.
- Uses native sockets by default, libpcap can be used by setting conf.use_pcap to
  True
- On Windows, Npcap/Winpcap is preferred for packet capture
- Sessions are only available since Scapy 2.4.3
- Provides a directed graph from all the routes.
- Can create 3D representations of the traceroute.
- Uses Scapy functions for sending and receiving packets at various layers.
- Requires setup of appropriate libraries for packet capture on different platforms.
- Scapy can perform TCP traceroute with simultaneous packet sending.
- Traceroute can create directed graphs of routes.
- Requires monitoring mode for wireless frame injection.
- On interactive mode, the default log level is INFO
- Adding a new protocol is easy by subclassing Packet and defining fields.
- A layer is a subclass of the Packet class.
- Get the UDP checksum computed by Scapy
- Set the UDP checksum to 0 and compute the checksum 'manually'
- The loopback interface is a very special interface. Packets going through it are
  not really assembled and disassembled.
- 'If you are using Npcap: please note that Npcap `npcap-0.9983` broke the 802.11
  support until `npcap-1.3.0`. Avoid using those versions.'
- On Linux, libpcap does not support loopback IPv4 pings.
- This does NOT apply for Windows XP, which isn’t supported by Npcap.
- If you get the message 'Winpcap is installed over Npcap.' it means that you have
  installed both Winpcap and Npcap versions, which isn’t recommended.
- If you get the message 'The installed Windump version does not work with Npcap'
  it means that you have probably installed an old version of Windump, made for Winpcap.
- ASN.1 is a notation whose goal is to specify formats for data exchange.
- Scapy provides a way to easily encode or decode ASN.1 and also program those encoders/decoders.
- An Automaton can be reset using restart(). It is then possible to run it again.
- Remember to call destroy() once you’re done using an Automaton.
- Uses TPROXY to intercept and modify traffic.
- Self-signed certificates are generated by default for TLS.
- Scapy can parse MIB files and become aware of a mapping between an OID and its name.
- Uses SNMP version 3 with community 'public'
- Can parse MIB files to resolve OIDs
- Scapy does not support Bluetooth interfaces on Windows.
- You must run these examples as root. These have only been tested on Linux, and require
  Scapy v2.4.3 or later.
- These examples only been tested on Linux, and require Scapy v2.4.3 or later.
- DCE/RPC is stateful, and requires the dissector to remember which interface is bound
- Scapy has opted to not abstract any of the NDR fields
- Currently, a DCERPC_Server will let a client bind on all interfaces that Scapy has
  registered (imported). Supposedly though, you know which RPCs are going to be queried.
- See the examples in [DCE/RPC] to connect with SPNEGO/Kerberos.
- Scapy’s Kerberos implementation is accessed through two main components.
- The Ticketer module can be used both from the CLI or programmatically to perform
  operations on Kerberos tickets.
- This section is useful to understand the inner workings of Kerberos, but isn’t necessary
  to use Scapy’s implementation.
- This section is useful to understand the inner workings of Kerberos FAST, but FAST
  can simply be used in Ticketer through the armor_with parameter when performing
  either a ASREQ or TGSREQ.
- Uses Kerberos authentication
- By default, the server certificate is NOT checked when using TLS.
- To use TLS securely, a sslcontext must be passed.
- For Scapy to be able to dissect it correctly, one must also configure the layer
  for it to know the location of each data in the buffer.
- SCTP is a relatively young transport-layer protocol combining both TCP and UDP characteristics.
- These capabilities are not always enabled by default on Linux.
- Scapy provides pretty good support for SMB 2/3 and very partial support of SMB1.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Using kernel’s TCP stack means you’ll depend on your local firewall’s rules and
  the kernel’s routing table.
- specifically for HTTP, you could pass HTTP instead of Raw.
- This module only works on BSD, Linux and macOS.
- Using TUN/TAP generally requires running Scapy (and these utilities) as root.
- If you're new to using Scapy, start with the usage documentation, which describes
  how to use Scapy with Ethernet and IP.
- Support for Classic Bluetooth in bluez is quite mature, however BLE is under active
  development.
- 'Forwarding machine can be used in two modes: SERVER and TPROXY.'
- By default, it will generate lookalike self-signed certificates.
- A script called ‘vethrelay.sh’ is provided for setting TPROXY mode.
- These functions are missing when python is compiled without IPv6 support, on Windows
  for instance.
- 'threaded: if you’re planning to send/receive many packets, it’s likely a good idea
  to use threaded mode.'
