auth_info:
- information_source; https://develop-1.dev.aquariusdev.net/AQUARIUS/Acquisition/v2:
  - Basic authentication is required for file uploads. Credentials are sent via the
    curl -u flag as username:password, which translates to an Authorization header
    with Basic scheme (base64-encoded "username:password"). File uploads use multipart/form-data
    format with form fields for file content and metadata parameters.
  - Most AQUARIUS API operations require authentication via an authentication token
    obtained from Springboard. The token is automatically propagated from your Springboard
    session to API requests made in the same browser context. API calls without valid
    authentication will fail with HTTP 401 (Not Authorized). For programmatic access,
    you must obtain and include the authentication token in your requests, though
    the specific mechanism for token inclusion is not detailed in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://develop-1.dev.aquariusdev.net/AQUARIUS/Provisioning/v1:
  - Most operations in the AQUARIUS Provisioning API require authentication via a
    token obtained from a Springboard session. The authentication token is automatically
    propagated to API requests when you keep Springboard open in a browser tab while
    accessing the API. An HTTP 401 (Not Authorized) response indicates that logging
    in to Springboard is required. Specific details about header names, parameter
    locations, and token formats are described in the AQUARIUS Common API Reference
    Guide.
