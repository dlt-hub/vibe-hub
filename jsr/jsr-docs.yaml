notes:
- All requests to the JSR registry API must be made with an Accept header that does
  not include text/html.
- JSR packages are published using the `jsr publish` / `deno publish` command.
- This package works with Deno, Bun
- It is unknown whether this package works with Node.js
- HTTP server with file-based routing for Deno that supports middleware and dynamic
  routing.
- Stateless mode is only available with HTTP streaming transport.
- Features that depend on persistent sessions will not be available in stateless mode.
- FastMCP supports session-based authentication, allowing you to secure your server
  and control access to its features.
- Stateless mode is only available with HTTP streaming transport. Features that depend
  on persistent sessions (like session-specific state) will not be available in stateless
  mode.
- Session IDs are automatically generated by the MCP transport layer
- In stateless mode, session IDs are not persisted across requests
- High-performance web framework built for Bun, Deno, NodeJS and Cloudflare Workers
- Uses trie-based routing, middleware support, and TypeScript-first design
- A high-performance web framework built for Bun, Deno, NodeJS and Cloudflare Workers
- This package works with Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Deno, Bun, Browsers
- It is designed to be easy to use and understand, while still being powerful enough
  to be useful in real-world applications.
- This package currently doesn't correctly read replies that contain CRLF (`\r\n`)
  within the message.
- Replies containing CRLF may not be read correctly.
- This library is a port of the readability.js library that uses cheerio instead of
  native DOM APIs.
- For untrusted input, use a sanitizer library like DOMPurify to avoid script injection.
- Works with Browsers
- Due to limitations of `npm` and `yarn`, they may sometimes install duplicate copies
  of your JSR dependencies.
- We recommend using `pnpm` for the best experience.
- JSR uses OIDC-based authentication for publishing packages from CI
- JSR uses a tokenless interactive authentication flow for publishing from a local
  machine
- You will be prompted to authenticate with JSR when publishing packages.
- You can use JSR packages in any runtime that supports ES modules, like Deno, Node.js,
  Bun, Cloudflare Workers, etc.
- You should check the new .npmrc file into source control - it will be needed to
  install updates to JSR modules.
- JSR packages are published as ESM modules.
- Authentication will happen via your browser, so you do not need to provide any credentials
  to the CLI.
- JSR does not support symlinks or hardlinks in packages.
- Ensure the module mentioned in the error message is not excluded in the config file.
- JSR performs deduplication of dependencies based on semantic versions, which is
  not possible with HTTPS-imported dependencies.
- There are no plans to discontinue or shut down deno.land/x.
- JSR is designed to be a public good for the JavaScript community, and will thus
  always be free to use.
- Currently, the only tool that natively supports JSR is Deno.
- JSR analyzes TypeScript types in the source code to generate documentation and type
  declarations.
- JSR does not provide private registry functionality itself at this time.
- 'Aligning JSRs package tarball URLs with the NPM upstream is being tracked in issue
  #405.'
- JSR automatically creates provenance statements for each package that is published
  from GitHub Actions.
- These badges can be customized by adding query parameters to the URL.
- JSR is immutable to ensure that packages are reliable.
- If you need to change a package version, you can publish a new version.
- Quotas can be increased by contacting JSR support at quotas@jsr.io.
- These quotas can be increased by contacting jsr support.
- JSR is not owned by any one person or organization.
- JSR is currently operated by the Deno company.
- Board decisions and meeting minutes will be posted publicly on an accessible platform,
  such as the organization’s website or a public repository.
- 'JSR packages are always ESM-only, so your project must be using ''type'': ''module''
  in your ''package.json'' to use JSR packages.'
- A .npmrc file is created when using the JSR CLI. The .npmrc file that is created
  should be checked into source control. Without this, future calls to npm install
  / yarn / pnpm install / bun install will not succeed.
- A .npmrc file is created when using the JSR CLI. The .npmrc file that is created
  should be checked into source control.

  JSR does not allow.'
- Slow types may degrade type checking performance by at least 1.5-2x.
- Packages with slow types cannot generate type declarations for the npm compatibility
  layer.
- Certain features may not work or degrade in quality if slow types are present.
- These rate limits exist to prevent abuse.
- 400 Invalid request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 404 Scope not found
