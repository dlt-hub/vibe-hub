notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The Fortis Gateway (Zeamster) API is in maintenance mode.
- Some endpoints require the api_id field to be submitted.
- Ensure to configure OAuth settings for proper authentication
- Enhanced user experience by changing radio style buttons to toggle buttons
- Links expire after 15 minutes of being generated for security
- All data that is passed in to the Hosted Payment Page needs to be encrypted using
  the HPP Encryption Key.
- Do not use PayForm or AccountForm in a public-facing application.
- Using the forms keeps you out of scope for PCI compliance.
- This integration method has been deprecated.
- Requires setup of PCI compliance.
- Marketplace can be configured to send post/delete requests to your application.
- Ensure that Fortis' support team has sent you your appropriate credentials.
- The request will automatically be assembled and sent to the gateway.
- The SDK supports both Non EMV Transactions and EMV transactions.
- Auth Deferred Transactions supported as of version 1.1.0.
- The generated HMAC will be good for 15 minutes.
- The maximum number of records that will be returned on a request is 5000, even if
  page_size is set to a larger number.
- The URL must respond with an HTTP status of 2xx to acknowledge the request.
- The number of postback retries is based on the number_of_attempts and attempt_interval
  values.
