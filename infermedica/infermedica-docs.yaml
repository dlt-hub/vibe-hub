pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://developer.infermedica.com/documentation/engine-api/build-your-solution/suggest-related-concepts/
  : - The suggest method accepts a `max_results` query parameter to limit the maximum
      number of results returned, with a default limit of 8. The engine may return
      fewer results than the specified maximum based on significance determination,
      and the response is a JSON array of symptom objects.
- information_source; https://developer.infermedica.com/documentation/platform-api/build-your-solution/users/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters cursor (page position) and limit (results per
    page, default 10). Response includes self, first, prev, next, and last URL fields
    for navigation, plus items array containing the actual data. Use the next URL
    to retrieve subsequent pages until next is null.
- information_source; https://developer.infermedica.com/documentation/platform-api/build-your-solution/patients/:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with a limit query parameter. The request
    includes limit (default or specified value) and cursor (starting at 0), and the
    response contains self, first, prev, next, and last URL fields; when next is null,
    there are no more pages to retrieve.
  - The GET endpoint for querying multiple patients at `https://api.infermedica.com/api/mgp/v1/patients`
    uses query parameter pagination with `cursor` (currently viewed page) and `limit`
    (number of patients per page, accepts values 1-50). The response returns up to
    the specified limit of patients.
- information_source; https://developer.infermedica.com/documentation/platform-api/build-your-solution/surveys/:
  - Pagination uses optional `limit` query parameter to control elements per page
    and `cursor` query parameter to navigate pages. Response includes `self`, `first`,
    `prev`, `next`, and `last` URL fields; use the `next` URL to fetch subsequent
    pages, stopping when `next` is null.
