auth_info:
- information_source; https://screenshotlayer.com/documentation:
  - API requests require an access_key query parameter. Include your access key in
    the URL query string as access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY when making requests to https://api.screenshotlayer.com/api/capture.
    The access key authenticates your API calls and determines your rate limit tier
    based on your subscription plan.
  - 'API requests to screenshotlayer require two authentication credentials sent as
    query parameters: access_key (your API key) and secret_key (an MD5 hash generated
    by combining the target URL with a secret keyword). Both parameters must be included
    in the request URL to the endpoint https://api.screenshotlayer.com/api/capture.'
  - Every user receives a personal API Access Key upon signup, which must be appended
    as the access_key query parameter to authenticate with the screenshotlayer API.
    The base URL for requests is http://api.screenshotlayer.com/api/capture?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY,
    and secure HTTPS connections are supported by using https instead of http.
  - Screenshotlayer API uses an access_key parameter for authentication. The access_key
    must be passed as a required parameter in API requests to http://api.screenshotlayer.com/api/capture,
    along with the target url parameter. This is a simple key-based authentication
    scheme where your personal access_key serves as your credential.
