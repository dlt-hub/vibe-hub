notes:
- Access token is valid for 2 hours.
- Loadsmart includes a signature in the X-Loadsmart-Signature header of each webhook
  request.
- Remember to keep your Client Secret secure and never expose it in client-side code
  or public repositories.
- 'In cases where an endpoint does not have an explicitly defined rate limit, the
  default applies: 5 requests per minute per consumer.'
- Keep track of API changes and version updates with our changelog.
- It is essential that you review the changelog to understand API changes and ensure
  that your application is consistent with our most recent enhancements.
- Your endpoint should be able to process HTTP POST requests.
- It should return a 2xx status code (preferably 200 OK) to acknowledge receipt of
  the webhook.
- If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, Loadsmart will consider the delivery
  failed and will retry the webhook.
- Implement proper error handling and logging in your endpoint to troubleshoot any
  issues.
- Ensure your endpoint can handle concurrent requests, as multiple webhooks may be
  sent simultaneously.
- EDI remains a crucial standard for logistics transaction processing.
- ShipperGuide enables safe EDI data delivery between trading partners.
- Rate Providers can bid on quotes that are relevant to them.
- Webhook technology notifies Rate Providers about new loads.
