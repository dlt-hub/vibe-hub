auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/hardware/gateways/concepts/adding-gateways/:
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header.
    Include the header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" where $API_KEY is your API
    key. The API key is returned when created and should be used for subsequent requests
    to authenticate.'
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The API
    key is provided as an environment variable (referenced as $API_KEY in the cURL
    example) and must be sent in the request header as "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY".
    The token grants access based on assigned rights, such as "Link as Gateway to
    a Gateway Server for traffic exchange".'
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. The API key must be passed in
    the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" in HTTP requests.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer $API_KEY" for requests to the gateway management endpoint.
  - 'The API requires bearer token authentication. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" where $API_KEY is your API key value.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/api/concepts/pagination/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (number of objects per page, optional with
    RPC-default if unset) and page (page number, 0-indexed, required). Response includes
    X-Total-Count header with total accessible objects; clients calculate total pages
    as X-Total-Count/limit and increment page to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit and page, both optional. The limit parameter
    controls items per page, and page specifies the page number (starting from 1).
    Responses return the requested items in an array; pagination ends when a page
    number exceeds the total page count, returning an empty object.
- information_source; https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/api/reference/http/routes/:
  - Page-based pagination is used with page (query parameter, optional, 0 interpreted
    as 1) and limit (query parameter, optional, controls results per page). The response
    structure for pagination fields is not documented in the provided excerpt.
  - Pagination is controlled by a `limit` parameter in the request body under `time_window`,
    which limits the number of results per page as an integer. However, the documentation
    does not describe how to navigate to subsequent pages, what response fields indicate
    pagination state, or when pagination ends.
  - Pagination uses `limit` (integer, optional) to set results per page and `page`
    (integer, optional) for page number, where 0 is treated as 1. Response includes
    `api_keys.items` array containing paginated results.
