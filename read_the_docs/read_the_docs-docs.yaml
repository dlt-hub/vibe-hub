pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/latest/api/v2.html:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with next and previous URI fields returned
    in the response. The response includes a count field for total number of builds
    and a results array containing the paginated Build objects. To retrieve the next
    page, use the URI provided in the next field; pagination ends when next is null.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with next and previous fields. Request pagination
    by using query parameters (exact pagination parameters not explicitly documented
    in this excerpt). Response includes next and previous URI strings for navigating
    pages, a count field for total project count, and results array containing project
    objects. Stop paginating when next is null.
  - Uses limit and offset query parameters for pagination. Response includes count
    (total number of versions), next (URI for next page), previous (URI for previous
    page), and results array. Stop paginating when next is null.
- information_source; https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/api/v3.html:
  - All endpoints returning lists are paginated with a default of 10 objects per page.
    Use the `limit` query parameter to change page size. The response includes `count`,
    `next`, and `previous` attributes for navigation between pages.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes count
    (total items), next (URL for next page with limit and offset), previous (URL for
    previous page or null), and results (array of items). Increment offset by limit
    value to fetch subsequent pages; stop when next is null.
