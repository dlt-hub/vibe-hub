auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mintlify.com/blog/steps-to-autogenerate:
  - 'The authentication configuration for the API playground in Mintlify docs is specified
    in the mint.json file under the "api.auth" object. The "method" field accepts
    one of three values: "bearer" for bearer token authentication, "basic" for HTTP
    basic authentication, or "key" for API key authentication. The baseUrl must also
    be configured to specify where the API playground sends requests.'
- information_source; https://www.mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration:
  - The API uses a custom API key authentication method. The API key must be sent
    in the request header named `x-api-key`.
- information_source; https://www.mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup:
  - Bearer authentication is used, where credentials are sent as a bearer token in
    the Authorization header. The security scheme is defined as type "http" with scheme
    "bearer", and is applied to endpoints via a security field that references "bearerAuth".
    Clients send requests with an Authorization header formatted as "Bearer <token>".
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Define the authentication method in the
    `securitySchemes` field under `components` with a type of `http` and scheme of
    `bearer`. The API playground will automatically add authentication fields based
    on the security configuration in the OpenAPI document.
