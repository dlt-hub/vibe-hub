auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.byner.com/hc/en-us/articles/17019900582172-Working-with-the-Byner-REST-API:
  - 'API key authentication is required. The apiKey parameter must be passed as a
    query parameter in the request URL. Example: ?apiKey=abcdefg'
  - Starting January 2025, the Byner REST API uses API key authentication via a URL
    parameter instead of OAuth2. An API key is required to securely request data from
    the Byner REST API running on the Salesforce platform.
  - The API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named `apiKey`. Include
    this parameter in the request URL (e.g., `?apiKey=abcdefg`) to authenticate requests
    to the Byner REST API endpoints.
  - 'The API requires the following authentication credentials to be sent as headers
    in requests: SessionId (obtained from a previous POST response), and apiKey (a
    unique environment-specific string that must be provided when using the Byner
    Website REST API). Both headers are required for document upload operations.'
  - 'The API requires two headers for authentication: SessionId (a Salesforce session
    identifier) and apiKey (an API key parameter). Both must be provided in the request
    headers to authenticate requests to this endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.byner.com/hc/en-us/articles/17019900582172-Working-with-the-Byner-REST-API:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a `start` query parameter (optional,
    default 100) to control pagination. When results exceed 500 Job Postings, responses
    are split into pages with a `next` field containing the URL for the next page.
