auth_info:
- information_source; https://partner-api-docs-origin.stage.solvhealth.com/v1/partner/docs/quick-start:
  - 'Requests require two authentication headers: Authorization Bearer token (obtained
    via access token endpoint) and x-api-key header with your CLIENT_ID. Send both
    headers with each API request to partner-api.solvhealth.com.'
  - 'The Solv Partner API uses two-part authentication: first, send an x-api-key header
    with your client ID to POST /v1/auth/token (along with client secret credentials)
    to obtain an access token; then use that token for subsequent requests. Different
    endpoints require specific scopes, which must be specified when obtaining the
    token.


    Key details: x-api-key header contains your client ID; POST /v1/auth/token endpoint
    is used to exchange client credentials (client ID and client secret) for an access
    token; scope parameter must be provided during token request to match the endpoint
    being accessed; the access token is then used for authorized requests to other
    endpoints.'
