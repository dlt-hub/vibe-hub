auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cloudblue.com/cbc/sdk/8.0/systems/ready/:
  - An access to the APS bus through an API gateway is allowed on behalf of a user
    authenticated through the OAuth protocol. The system property APS OAuth API Gateway
    URL specifies an API gateway integrated with the platform, configured per reseller
    in the reseller control panel. The security privilege OAuth APS Bus Access assigned
    through a security role allows users to manage or view the APS Bus Access user
    configuration. The API gateway must forward the X-Forwarded-Host header in requests.
- information_source; https://docs.cloudblue.com/cbc/sdk/8.0/systems/user/:
  - Systems authenticated through OAuth protocol must be granted the POST operation
    on the http://www.parallels.com/pa/pa-core-services APS type. Include the X-Options-Send-Invitation
    header set to true if new users should receive email invitations to log in.

  - The user whose credentials are used to call the `getDealsPerUnit` operation must
    be allowed to send POST requests to the singleton resource based on the `http://www.parallels.com/products/automation/billing`
    APS type. Refer to the Set Up the User's Credentials section for OAuth 1.0 configuration
    details on how to configure user credentials for this operation.

    ID in the APS-Subscription-ID header with each request to the APS API endpoint.
  - The API uses the APS-Subscription-ID header for authentication. This header must
    be included in requests and contains a subscription identifier value that authorizes
    access to resources within that subscription context.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cloudblue.com/cbc/sdk/8.0/systems/order/:

    using limit(from, to) syntax to specify the range of results to return.
