  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signing with an API key and secret. The API-KEY
    header contains your key, and the API-SIGNATURE header contains an HMAC-SHA256
    hexdigest computed from URL-encoded request parameters using your API secret as
    the key.


    Required headers: API-KEY (your API key string) and API-SIGNATURE (HMAC-SHA256
    hexdigest). Required payload fields: client_request_id, timestamp (current time
    in milliseconds). Signing process: URL-encode all request parameters, compute
    HMAC-SHA256 using the encoded parameters as message and API secret (encoded as
    UTF-8) as key, convert to hexdigest. The signature is computed before sending
    the request and included in the API-SIGNATURE header. Both GET and POST requests
    require these headers and the timestamp parameter in the request payload or query
    parameters.'
  - 'Authentication uses two required header parameters: api-key (string) and api-signature
    (string). These headers must be included with all requests to authenticate the
    client.'
  - Blockchain.com Institutional API uses HMAC-SHA256 request signing. Include API-KEY
    and API-SIGNATURE in HTTP request headers. The signature is computed as sha256
    hash of the request payload (key-value pairs in alphabetical order) combined with
    your API Secret. All requests require a timestamp parameter in UTC milliseconds,
    not older than 30 seconds. Contact Blockchain.com Institutional to obtain your
    API Key and API Secret credentials.
