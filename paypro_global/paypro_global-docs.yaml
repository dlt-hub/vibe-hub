auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.payproglobal.com/docs/api/overview/:
  - 'Pro Global API requires two authentication parameters passed with each request:
    VendorAccountId (found in Account settings > Business info) and ApiSecretKey (generated
    by your account manager and visible in Store settings > Integration tab). Additionally,
    API calls are verified by IP address, so you must whitelist your IP addresses
    with accounts@payproglobal.com before making requests. The ApiSecretKey is a sensitive
    credential that must be stored securely and never exposed publicly; if compromised,
    it must be regenerated and the old key revoked.'
- information_source; https://developers.payproglobal.com/docs/api/affiliates/assign-to-order/:
  - Authentication uses a vendor account API secret key sent as a required field in
    the JSON request body. The apiSecretKey parameter, obtained from Store settings
    > General settings > Integration tab, must be included along with vendorAccountId
    in each API request to authenticate the caller.
