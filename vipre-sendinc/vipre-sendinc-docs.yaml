notes:
- SafeSend will work with any .NET CORE 8.0 capable web server
- Microsoft requires the site where the add-in is hosted to be SSL-secured
- Deploying the SafeSend web add-in can take up to 12 hours to propagate the network
- Any changes made to Settings.json require the website to be restarted to take effect;
  This should be done outside of normal operating hours to avoid potential service
  interruptions
- You'll need an FTP Client (like Filezilla) for the next part
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The message body will be returned in HTML, even for messages that were submitted
  in plain-text.
- Some functionality is limited to only Sendinc Pro and Sendinc Corporate accounts.
