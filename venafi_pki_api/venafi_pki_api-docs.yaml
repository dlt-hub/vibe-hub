pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.venafi.com/Docs/25.1/TopNav/Content/SDK/WebSDK/r-SDK-GET-Certificates.php:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    how many results to return per request, and offset specifies the starting position.
    The response includes a DataRange field indicating the result range and a TotalCount
    field for total results. HAL-based links for previous and next pages are provided
    in the response for programmatic navigation.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of results per request (set to 2 in the example), and offset specifies the starting
    position (set to 0). The response returns a Certificates array; iterate by incrementing
    offset by the limit value until fewer results than limit are returned.
