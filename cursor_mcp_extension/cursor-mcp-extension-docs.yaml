notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Cursor
- Cursor CLI is currently in beta, we’d love your feedback on it!
- Context is the foundation of effective AI coding, consisting of intent (what you
  want) and state (what exists). Providing both helps Cursor make accurate predictions.
- Use surgical context with @-symbols (@code, @file, @folder) to guide Cursor precisely,
  rather than relying solely on automatic context gathering.
- Capture repeatable knowledge in rules for team-wide reuse, and extend Cursor’s capabilities
  with Model Context Protocol to connect external systems.
- Insufficient context leads to hallucinations or inefficiency, while too much irrelevant
  context dilutes the signal. Strike the right balance for optimal results.
- While Cursor works without an account, signing up unlocks all AI features.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Tab is a specialized Cursor model for autocompletion.
- Background agents require data retention on the order of a few days.
- Ensure you’re logged in and have connected your GitHub account.
- You will also need to be on a Pro Trial or paid plan with usage based pricing enabled.
- Project rules are stored in .cursor/rules and are version-controlled.
- User rules apply globally across all projects.
- Cursor indexes all files except those in ignore files (e.g. .gitignore, .cursorignore).
- Ignoring large content files improves answer accuracy.
- Cursor reads and indexes your project’s codebase to power its features.
- Control which directories and files Cursor can access using a `.cursorignore` file
  in your root directory.
- MCP servers use environment variables for authentication.
- Cursor supports OAuth for servers that require it.
- Requires Cursor admin access and GitHub org admin access.
- Background Agents require temporary code storage while running.
- Custom API keys only work with standard chat models.
- Cursor supports both light and dark themes for your coding environment.
- Cursor inherits VS Code’s theming capabilities - use any VS Code theme, create custom
  themes, and install theme extensions from the marketplace.
- Commands are installed in your system’s default shell configuration file (e.g.,
  .bashrc, .zshrc, or .config/fish/config.fish).
- All third party MCP connections must be explicitly approved by the user.
- Teams accounts are charged per seat with pro-rated billing for new members.
- Invoices must be downloaded manually from the billing portal.
- Cursor relies on HTTP/2 for AI features because it handles streamed responses efficiently
- Some corporate proxies (e.g., Zscaler) block HTTP/2
- Request IDs are limited when Privacy Mode is enabled.
- Cursor issues can stem from extensions, app data, or system problems.
- Try disabling all extensions temporarily to identify problematic ones.
