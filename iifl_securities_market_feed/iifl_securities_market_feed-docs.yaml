auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.iiflsecurities.com/market-feed.html:
  - This API requires an active session after successful login. Authentication is
    handled via the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header, which must be provided in the
    request headers after registration. The exact header name is Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
    and its value should be the subscription key provided during registration.
- information_source; https://api.iiflsecurities.com/vendor-login.html:
  - Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header is required and must be provided after registration.
    This is sent as a request header with the value provided during registration.
    The login endpoint accepts email and contact number as credentials in the JSON
    request body to authenticate clients and establish a session for subsequent API
    access.
- information_source; https://api.iiflsecurities.com/customer-login.html:
  - Clients must pass Client ID, password, and My2PIN in encrypted format to authenticate.
    The login endpoint requires the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header (provided after
    registration) and returns a session cookie that must be included in all subsequent
    API requests. Request headers must include Content-Type as application/json and
    appName, appVer, and key fields in the request body.
- information_source; https://api.iiflsecurities.com/client-profile.html:
  - 'The API requires two authentication credentials sent in the request header: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
    header which must be provided after registration, and appName and key fields in
    the JSON request body where appName is the app name from registration and key
    is the UserKey generated at registration time.'
- information_source; https://api.iiflsecurities.com/Historical-Candle-Data.html:
  - 'Authentication requires three headers: x-clientcode (client identifier string),
    x-auth-token (JWT token obtained after login), and Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key (subscription
    key provided by IIFL at registration). All three headers are mandatory and cannot
    be empty.'
