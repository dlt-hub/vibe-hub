auth_info:
- information_source; https://wilsonmar.github.io/cloud-foundry/:
  - UAA uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. Tokens are
    passed around as unique identifiers that provide both authentication credentials
    and authorization permissions. Users manage settings via the cf CLI tool or UAA
    Command Line Interface (UAAC) depending on the hosting provider, and must log
    in using cf login to authenticate with the Cloud Foundry endpoint.
- information_source; https://wilsonmar.github.io/gcp/:
  - Authentication using OAuth2 (JWT) with JSON is required. Refer to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication
    for detailed implementation.
  - Google STS API uses a token exchange flow where third-party credentials (like
    OIDC JWTs) are exchanged for short-lived Google Cloud access tokens. The exchange
    is performed via POST to https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token with a JSON body
    containing audience (the Workload Identity Pool Provider resource name), grantType
    set to "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange", and subjectToken (the
    third-party JWT). The response returns a short-lived access token for Google Cloud
    resources.

  - The LUIS API requires an API key for authentication. The ApiKey parameter must
    be provided when running LUIS containers via the Billing configuration, and the
    AppID must be included in the prediction endpoint URL path at the /luis/v3.0/apps/{APP_ID}/slots/production/predict
    or /luis/v2.0 endpoints. Additionally, a Starter Key provides 1000 prediction
    endpoint requests per month for free.
