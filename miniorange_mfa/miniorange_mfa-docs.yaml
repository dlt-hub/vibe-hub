auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/idp/api/multi-factor-authentication:
  - The Validate OTP REST API requires authentication via customer credentials sent
    in the JSON request body. Specifically, you must include customerKey (your customer
    key) and username (the enrolled user's email) in the POST request to https://login.xecurify.com/moas/api/auth/validate,
    along with the token field containing the OTP to validate.
- information_source; https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/idp/api/groups-api-guide:
  - 'API authentication uses HMAC-SHA512 signature verification. Three headers are
    required: Customer-Key (the customer identifier), Timestamp (current time in milliseconds),
    and Authorization (SHA-512 hash of concatenated customerKey, timestamp, and apiKey).


    To authenticate: compute stringToHash as customerKey concatenated with currentTimeInMillis
    concatenated with apiKey, hash it using SHA-512, then include three headers in
    the request: Customer-Key header with the customerKey value, Timestamp header
    with the current time in milliseconds, and Authorization header with the computed
    hash value.'
  - 'All requests require three custom headers: Customer-Key (your account customer
    key as an integer), Timestamp (current time in milliseconds), and Authorization
    (SHA-512 hash of the concatenated string: customerKey + timeInMillis + apiKey).
    Include these headers in every API request.'
  - Authentication uses HMAC-SHA512 signing with three required headers. Include Customer-Key
    header with the customerKey value, Timestamp header with current time in milliseconds,
    and Authorization header with SHA512 hash of concatenated currentTimeInMillis,
    0, empty string, empty string, and apiKey.
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA512. Include three headers: Customer-Key (your customer
    key), Timestamp (current time in milliseconds), and Authorization (SHA-512 hash
    of concatenated customerKey + timestamp + apiKey). The apiKey is provided separately
    and used only for hash computation, not sent directly.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/idp/api/groups-api-guide:
  - Pagination uses batchSize and batchNo parameters in the request body. batchSize
    specifies the number of records per batch (required), and batchNo specifies which
    batch to retrieve (required, starting from 1). Increment batchNo to fetch subsequent
    batches.
  - The API uses batch-based pagination with required parameters batchSize (number
    of items per batch) and batchNo (batch number starting from 1) sent in the request
    body. The response returns customerId and data for the requested batch; continue
    paginating by incrementing batchNo until no more data is returned.
- information_source; https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/idp/api/user-api-guide:
  - Pagination is handled using batchSize and batchNo parameters in the request body.
    batchSize specifies the number of users per batch (maximum 500), and batchNo specifies
    which batch to retrieve (starting from 1). To fetch all users, increment batchNo
    in subsequent requests until no more results are returned.
