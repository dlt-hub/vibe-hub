auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.3/Logging.html:
  - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant is used for Web API authentication. Clients
    authenticate using a Client ID and obtain an Access Token, which is then used
    to access protected endpoints. The Client ID is associated with a Service Account,
    and access is logged with events including ACCESS_TOKEN_RETURNED and ACCESS_TOKEN_USED.
    Audit logs are stored in oauth_client_credentials_grant_for_web_apis.csv in the
    <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/audit directory and record Client ID, Service Account username,
    access tokens returned, and endpoints accessed.

  - Use query parameter `page` (set to `ri!batchNumber`) to paginate through results.

    can specify which fields to return.
