auth_info:
- information_source; https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/integrate-google-api-with-salesforce/:
  - Authorization requires OAuth2 with Google APIs. You must create credentials in
    Google Console, configure an OAuth Consent Screen with your Lightning org URL,
    set a redirect URL pointing to a Lightning component, and use the client key and
    redirect_uri in your Apex code to generate an authentication URL via EncodingUtil.urlEncode().
- information_source; https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/top-salesforce-integration-challenges-and-how-to-solve-them/:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 with Connected Apps is recommended for secure authorization between
    systems. Store credentials using Salesforce Named Credentials instead of hard-coded
    values, enable TLS encryption for all data in transit, and implement Multi-Factor
    Authentication (MFA) for API users. Use the callout: protocol prefix in HttpRequest
    endpoints to reference Named Credentials securely without exposing secrets in
    code.'
- information_source; https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/uploading-files-to-microsoft-one-drive-using-apex/:
  - Bearer token authentication. The Authorization header must be set to 'Bearer '
    concatenated with an accessToken value. The accessToken is passed as a parameter
    and must be a valid Microsoft Graph access token.
- information_source; https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/using-salesforce-bulk-api-v1/:
  - Session-based authentication is required. Include the X-SFDC-Session header with
    a session ID value in all requests to the Bulk API. The session ID must be obtained
    from Salesforce before making API calls.
- information_source; https://salesforcecodex.com/salesforce/using-salesforce-bulk-api-v2/:
  - Authorization header uses access_token obtained from login. The access_token value
    should be passed in the Authorization header (exact format shown as {{access_token
    from ...}}) for all subsequent API requests including job creation, batch upload,
    and job closure operations.
