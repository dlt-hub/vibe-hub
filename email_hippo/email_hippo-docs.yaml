auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.emailhippo.com:
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as a query parameter in
    the URL or as a request parameter when calling the endpoint at https://api.hippoapi.com/customer/reports/v3/quota.
    The exact parameter name and transmission method (query string vs header) are
    not explicitly detailed in this code snippet, but the comment indicates the API
    key must be provided as the second parameter in the query format.
  - Authentication is performed using a License key. The License key must be provided
    to access the Email Hippo v2 API. The exact method of transmitting this License
    key (header name, query parameter, request body field) is not specified in this
    documentation excerpt.
  - Email Hippo MORE uses API key authentication. The API key must be included in
    all requests and is appended to the URL path in the format "{endpoint}/{k}:{yourlicensekey}",
    where {k} is a literal string and yourlicensekey is your personal API key. Replace
    yourlicensekey with your actual license key provided for your account.
  - Email Hippo WHOIS uses API key authentication. The API key must be included in
    all requests as a URL path parameter named k with the format k/yourlicensekey,
    where yourlicensekey is replaced with your personal API key.
  - License key authentication is required. The license key should be sent as a parameter
    in requests to authenticate with the emailhippo.com API v3 service.
