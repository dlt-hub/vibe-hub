auth_info:
- information_source; https://stargate.io/docs/latest/concepts/concepts.html:
  - Stargate APIs require bearer token authentication passed via the X-Cassandra-Token
    header. Access tokens are generated and stored in a database by the auth-table-based
    service, and must be included in all requests to the REST API, GraphQL API, and
    Document API.
  - Stargate includes an Authentication Services component with an auth-api REST service
    for generating auth tokens and an auth-table-based-service to store tokens in
    the database. Tokens are used for authentication to Stargate, though specific
    header names, parameter names, and token format details are not provided in this
    documentation excerpt.
  - The REST API uses the auth-api to handle token access to endpoints. Tokens are
    created via the REST API and then passed in the GraphQL HTTP header request to
    access endpoints. The authentication mechanism involves token-based access control
    for both REST and GraphQL APIs.
- information_source; https://stargate.io/docs/latest/develop/attachments/restv1.html:
  - Authentication is required via the X-Cassandra-Token header. Include the token
    returned by the authentication endpoint in the X-Cassandra-Token header for requests
    to create keyspaces, tables, and other protected operations.
  - Authentication requires passing a Cassandra token via the X-Cassandra-Token header
    with every request. The token value should be obtained from the authentication
    endpoint and included in the request headers.
