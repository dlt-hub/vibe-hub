auth_info:
- information_source; https://duo.com/docs/adminapi:
  - Duo Admin API uses HMAC-SHA1 signature-based authentication. Construct a canonical
    ASCII string from date (RFC 2822 format, matching the Date header), HTTP method
    (uppercase), API hostname (lowercase), request path, and URL-encoded parameters
    (lexicographically sorted, blank line if no params), joined by newlines. Compute
    HMAC-SHA1 of this string using your secret key, convert to hexadecimal ASCII,
    and send via HTTP Basic Authentication with integration key as username and the
    hex signature as password.
  - HMAC-SHA1 based authentication using an integration key (ikey) and secret key
    (skey). Credentials are sent via the Authorization header as Basic auth with the
    format ikey:hmac_signature, along with a Date header. The HMAC is computed over
    a canonical string containing the HTTP method, host, path, current date, and sorted
    request parameters.
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Use the integration key as the username
    and an HMAC-SHA1 signature as the password. The signature is computed over a canonical
    string containing the date, HTTP method, host, path, and request parameters, then
    base64-encoded for the Authorization header. Include a Date header with the current
    time in RFC 2822 format. Signature validation is case-insensitive.
  - Requires "Grant administrators - Read" or "Grant administrators - Write" API permission
    to access the administrative units endpoint. Authentication is managed through
    Duo's standard API authentication mechanism using integration credentials (integration_key
    and secret_key) passed via HTTP request signing, though the specific header names
    and request signing details are not provided in this excerpt.
  - Requires "Grant administrators - Write" API permission to call this endpoint.
    The specific mechanism for providing this permission (whether via header, query
    parameter, or other means) is not detailed in the provided documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://duo.com/docs/adminapi:
  - Offset-based pagination is supported with optional `limit` (default 100, max 500)
    and `offset` (default 0) query parameters. The response includes `metadata.total_objects`
    indicating total record count; construct subsequent requests by incrementing `offset`
    by the `limit` value until all records are retrieved.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter (optional,
    default 100, max 500) controls the number of records returned per request. The
    offset parameter (optional, default 0) specifies the starting record position.
    Continue paginating by incrementing offset while the response metadata contains
    a next_offset value; stop when next_offset is absent.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with `mintime` parameter (Unix timestamp
    in seconds, optional) to retrieve records; the response includes `metadata.next_offset`
    for the next request and `metadata.total_objects` for total count. Up to 1000
    earliest events are returned per call; use `mintime+1` to avoid duplicates when
    paginating through logs.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation. Request parameter mintime (optional,
    Unix timestamp in seconds) filters records after a given time. Response includes
    next_offset field in metadata to construct subsequent requests. Maximum 1000 earliest
    events returned per call; iterate by passing next_offset value as mintime in subsequent
    requests.
  - Pagination uses optional `limit` and `offset` query parameters. `limit` sets the
    maximum records returned (default 50, max 100), and `offset` specifies the starting
    record position (default 0). The response is a JSON array; retrieve additional
    results by incrementing the offset value.
