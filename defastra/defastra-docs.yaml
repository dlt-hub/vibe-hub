notes:
- Each fraud check we perform drills deeply into the data associated with the phone
  number or email address provided, but delivers a simple and easily readable sentence
  that clearly says what happened.
- API access is automatically enabled on your Defastra account when you sign-up.
- Normal timeout settings offer the best results between reasonable response time
  and a low average of individual service lookup failure.
- If you are particularly interested in gathering the pictures behind a phone number
  or email address, the minimal mode of operation is discouraged.
- You can head to the API reference of the Deep Phone Check or Deep Email Check products
  and click on the example response result to see the JSON representation of a typical
  response.
- Each email address analysis goes beyond simplistic deliverability or temporary domain
  checks.
- Response times can be configured to return data more quickly, or in greater detail.
- The data are all in real-time and refreshed once per minute.
- The maximum amount of records that can be retrieved at once from the Observer is
  10,000.
- 'A public link has a simple format, for example: https://defastra.com/public-link-3712adaa4ed05164xxxx'
- When a link expires or is removed, it displays a 404 NOT FOUND error.
- Batches need up to 60 seconds to start processing your elements.
- We advise you to always set a label to your batch so that you can easily identify
  what data you used.
- Always remember that team members are linked to your billing and that any spending
  made by them will be deducted from your wallet.
- In order to avoid disruptions of service, be careful to have enough funds available
  to accommodate their spending.
- If there is suspicious activity on your account, change your password and log out
  all other sessions connected to your account.
- All of our prices are always in US dollars
- Card information is handled fully by Stripe and never touches our servers. Only
  the last 4 digits are stored, along with the expiration date, in order to identify
  your card.
