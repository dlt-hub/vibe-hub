notes:
- 'Pricing for the API is separate from the Screenleap subscription plans: you do
  not need a Screenleap subscription in order to use the API.'
- Each Screenleap subscription is intended for use by a single user whereas the API
  can be used for any number of concurrent users.
- The average number of participants in a share session is usually much lower than
  most people predict. For example, on Screenleap, the average share session has about
  3.6 total participants (one presenter and 2.6 viewers).
- Each share session supports one recording, meaning you can start and stop recording
  only once during the duration of the share session.
- Completed recordings will be retained for one month and then deleted.
- All API requests must include a valid accountid and authtoken.
- Requests that require passing in the authtoken must use SSL.
- API is designed for multiple concurrent share sessions.
- The roomId parameter needs to be added to connect presenters and viewers.
- roomId can be any arbitrary string and is not persisted.
- Auto-login requires user accounts with tokens.
errors:
- '401 - Unauthorized: The provided credential was missing or incorrect.'
- '403 - Forbidden: You are attempting to access a share session that you did not
  create through the Screenleap API.'
- '404 - Not Found: The share code that you are trying to stop does not exist or has
  already ended.'
