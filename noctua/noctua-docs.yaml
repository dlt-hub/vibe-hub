- information_source; https://api.noctuasky.com/api/v1/swaggerdoc/:
  - Login endpoint returns a JWT token that must be used for further API calls. Send
    the JWT in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for authenticated requests.
  - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. After logging in via a POST
    request to the login endpoint, you receive a JWT that must be included in subsequent
    API calls. The JWT is used to authenticate requests, including accessing the special
    'me' user ID to retrieve the current authenticated user's information.
