  : - Every notification channel is bound to an API key. The callback interface is
      registered via PUT /v2/notification/callback, and you can define optional headers
      including authorization headers with tokens to secure your callback URL and
      provide additional information to your web application.
    - 'The web application must provide an API key for WebSocket authentication in
      one of two ways: as a bearer token in the Authorization header, or in the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol
      header. Device Management verifies the API key before accepting the WebSocket
      connection with HTTP 101 Switching Protocols.'
