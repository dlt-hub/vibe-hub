- OAuth2 authentication is required for API access
- The MRR only includes services that are being billed. Services such as access ports
  do not begin billing right away, and therefore are not immediately included in the
  MRR.
- To include newly ordered ports, you will need to set the end date to at least 15
  days after the port was ordered.
- These graphs and numbers only include services that are billed. To include newly
  ordered ports, you will need to set the end date to at least 15 days after the port
  was ordered.

- Finalization is not permanent; you can later re-open finalized quotes.
- You cannot un-cancel a quote.
- You cannot un-cancel a quote. However, you can return to canceled quotes and duplicate
  them to create a new quote.
- Rate-limiting keys can use a combination of different properties to set a quota.
- The window for quotas can be a minute, an hour, or a day.
- All routes that share the same rate-limiting key will also share the same quota.
- Should the rate limit be exceeded, you will get a `429 — Too Many Requests` response
  error.
- Rate limits are enforced using a sliding window algorithm.
- If the rate limit is exceeded, a 429 — Too Many Requests response error will be
  returned.
- Ensure to set up OAuth2 credentials in the API dashboard.
- Credentials can be provided by using the PF_TOKEN, and optionally PF_USER and PF_PASSWORD
  environment variables.
- Some API endpoints may require additional permissions.
- Credentials can be provided by using the PF_TOKEN environment variable.
- You can only use Terraform to modify resources that were created via Terraform.
- To provision any new service, you will need to have your billing account ID.
- Changing the label will tell Terraform to delete the previously created resource
  and create a new one.
