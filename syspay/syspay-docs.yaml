auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.syspay.com/docs/api/v2/hospitality/api.html:
  - All request arguments should be sent in the POST body as JSON. As a security measure,
    SysPay only allows requests from specific authorized IP addresses. The API requires
    requests to be sent over HTTPS to the base URL https://app.syspay.com with the
    latest API version being v2.
- information_source; https://app.syspay.com/docs/api/v2/merchant/api.html:
  - The API uses WSSE (Web Services Security) authentication. Include an X-Wsse header
    with MerchantAPILogin, PasswordDigest, Nonce, and Created parameters. Generate
    the header by calling generateHeaders with your login and passphrase, which produces
    a formatted token string containing the required fields.
  - 'The SysPay API requires X-Wsse header authentication. Include the header X-Wsse
    with value following the pattern: AuthToken MerchantAPILogin="{merchantLogin}",
    PasswordDigest="{digest}", Nonce="{b64nonce}", Created="{timestamp}". The merchantLogin
    is your API login provided by SysPay along with a shared passphrase. The b64nonce
    is a base64-encoded random token generated per request, and digest and timestamp
    are derived from the passphrase and nonce.'
