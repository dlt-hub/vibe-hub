auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.inrule.com/hc/en-us/articles/13261372892557-API-Documentation:
  - A Ticket header previously generated from authentication is required. The exact
    header name is "Ticket" and it should contain the authentication token obtained
    from the authentication service. Content-Type header must be set to application/json
    for requests with bodies.
  - A ticket previously generated from authentication must be included in the request
    headers when uploading attachments to forms. The Content-Type header must be set
    to multipart/form-data. Permissions for the API user to attach files to specific
    forms are controlled through process settings, lane assignments, or manual task
    assignment.
  - A ticket previously generated from authentication must be provided in the request
    headers. The API user can only access start events they have been granted permission
    to, which is controlled by associating the API user with the lane where the start
    event is located. The Content-Type header must be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
  - 'API users must provide a Ticket header that was previously generated from authentication.
    The Ticket is sent in the request header along with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    API users can only access form templates and data for which they have been granted
    permission, which is configured in the process model.'
  - Authentication requires a Ticket header that is previously generated from authentication.
    The API user can only access instances for which permissions have been explicitly
    granted in the process model. Access control is enforced at the instance level
    based on user permissions set in the process application.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.inrule.com/hc/en-us/articles/13261372892557-API-Documentation:
  - Pagination uses Start (int, query parameter for offset) and Max (int, query parameter
    for page size, e.g. 200). Continue making requests with incrementing Start values
    until the Data section returns 0 rows.
  - Pagination uses query parameters start (int, required) and max (int, required,
    max 2000). Request subsequent pages by incrementing start by the previous max
    value. Stop when fewer items than max are returned in the response.
  - Start (int) and Max (int) are query parameters for pagination. Start specifies
    the index to begin retrieving records from (default 0), and Max specifies the
    maximum number of records to return per request. Iterate by incrementing Start
    by the Max value until fewer than Max records are returned, indicating the end
    of results.
  - Start (int) and Max (int) query parameters control pagination. Start specifies
    the offset (default 0) and Max specifies the number of results to return per request.
    The response includes Total count and Data array; continue requesting with incremented
    Start values until all results are retrieved.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination for retrieving instances. The GET /Instances
    endpoint accepts query parameters Start (offset, integer) and Max (limit, integer)
    to control pagination. The response includes a Total count field and a Data array
    containing instance records; use Start and Max values to iterate through pages
    until all records matching the total count are retrieved.
