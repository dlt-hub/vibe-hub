notes:
- Defaults are read from /snippets/config.json generated at build time.
- Ensure TypeScript is installed in your project
- Check that the config file exports a valid object
- Check that your test files match the `include` patterns
- Verify that your tests contain Shnippet tags
- Ensure your test files are in the correct directory
- Make sure `shnippet.config.js` is in your project root
- Verify all paths in the config are correct
- If fileExtensions is not provided at runtime, the manager attempts to fetch /snippets/config.json
  once to auto-load it.
- defaultLanguage always falls back to the first entry in fileExtensions.
- Dots are optional in fileExtensions across both extractor and client.
- The browser client is not SSR-safe; call it in the browser only, and ensure baseUrl
  serves files publicly.
