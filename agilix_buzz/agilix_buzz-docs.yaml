auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.agilixbuzz.com/docs/Concept/CommandUsage:
  - Authentication tokens are obtained from a Login endpoint and must be passed in
    subsequent API calls via URL parameters or POST body (not cookies). Tokens should
    never be stored in cookies and should not be passed across untrusted domains.
  - 'Most commands require authentication via the Login3 command, which returns a
    token value that must be sent as the ''_token'' parameter in subsequent API requests.
    Some commands (GetStatus, Login3, UpdatePassword, ResetPassword, GetPasswordPolicy,
    GetPasswordQuestion) do not require prior authentication. Rights are enforced
    per command based on the entity ID specified (format: right@entity).'
  - The API uses username and password credentials sent in POST requests. For XML
    requests, include cmd="login3", username="prefix/username", and password="password"
    in the request body. For JSON requests, send a JSON object with these same fields
    in the request body and set Content-Type to application/json. The username format
    is "domain/username". Responses can be requested in JSON by either adding _format=JSON
    as a query parameter or setting the Accept header to application/json.
