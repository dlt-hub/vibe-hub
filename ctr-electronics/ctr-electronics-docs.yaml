notes:
- By default, devices are configured with default current limits, listed in the relevant
  config API documentation.
- All current limits must be separately enabled using the appropriate enable config.
- Users utilizing only v5 devices still need the v6 vendordep added to their robot
  project.
- Currently only Phoenix 5 is supported in LabVIEW. A Phoenix 6 LabVIEW alpha is in
  development.
- Users in FRC can skip this article.
- Phoenix 6 is fully supported outside of FRC on supported systems with a USB to CAN
  adapter.
- CANivore is the recommended USB to CAN adapter with support for CAN FD, name specification,
  and Windows (as host).
- Custom bit rates and CAN 2.0 are not supported at this time.
- On a Raspberry Pi 4 or newer, the latest 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS image will default
  to using the 64-bit kernel while still using 32-bit APT packages.
- Users will need to update both firmware and API to make use of these features.
- This changelog is intended to highlight the major additions to the Phoenix 6 API.
- Improved API documentation of several configs, controls, and status signals
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Many Pigeon 2 signal getters in Phoenix 5 fill an array, such as YawPitchRoll. In
  Phoenix 6, these signals have been broken up into their individual components, such
  as Yaw, Pitch, and Roll.
- UpdateFreqHz can be set to 0 Hz to synchronously one-shot the control request.
- Motion Magic® S-Curve Strength has been replaced with jerk control in Phoenix 6.
- Users should keep total CAN bus utilization below 90% to prevent any unexpected
  behavior.
- Using Phoenix API will automatically start up a diagnostic server which adds a constant
  0-5% total CAN bus utilization.
- Default port for diagnostic server is 1250. FRC users should not change this.
- Device state is indicated by card colors.
- Users can batch upgrade devices from the Devices page.
- Users can plot and manipulate multiple signals simultaneously.
- Plotter has undergone strenuous stress testing to ensure hours of plotting operation.
- If the hoot log does not contain any Pro-licensed devices, a limited set of signals
  may be exported for free using the AdvantageScope (wpilog) option.
- Only Phoenix 6 supported hardware (e.g. Talon FX, Talon FXS, CANcoder, CANdi™, Pigeon
  2.0).
- Firmware version of devices should match the API year (25.X firmware corresponds
  to 2025 API/Tuner).
- Temporary diagnostic server (or an existing robot project for that year of software)
  must be running and Tuner should be connected to the robot.
- Users utilizing season pass must attach a team number before continuing.
- All license activation and verification features are only available in Phoenix Tuner
  X. Phoenix Tuner v1 does not support licensing actions.
- Users wishing to test magnet placement must wait 8 seconds after boot for the LEDs
  to blink the magnet placement status.
- Talon FXS is a versatile motor controller compatible with the CTRE software ecosystem.
- The vast majority of Phoenix 6 is thread-safe with a few exceptions.
- Phoenix 6 utilizes the C++ units library and, optionally, the Java units library
  when applicable. Using the Java units library may increase GC overhead.
- Signals represent live data reported by a device; these can be yaw, position, etc.
- A Signal Logging API is available for logging received signals.
- Users may need to synchronize with fresh data to minimize latency.
- Uses an opt-in model for status signals, maximizing the reduction in bus utilization.
- Devices maintain their configured status signal update frequencies until power cycled.
- Signal logging is enabled by default whenever it detects an FRC match is currently
  being played.
- Hoot Replay requires the hoot log to have a Pro-licensed device.
- Currently, only one hoot log may be replayed at a time.
- Only one hoot log may be replayed at a time.
- 'Faults are stored in two fashions: live and sticky.'
- Sticky faults can be cleared using the clearStickyFaults() method.
- CTR Electronics supported actuators have a safety feature where they will automatically
  disable output if they have not recently received an enable signal.
- In non-FRC applications, Unmanaged.feedEnable() must be called periodically to enable
  actuators.
- This must also be called to control devices in Phoenix Tuner X.
- The Tuner X CANivore USB server automatically calls Unmanaged.feedEnable() when
  control is enabled.
- The TalonFX + Kraken X60 does not support hardware limit switches. Instead, control
  request limit overrides can be used, or a CANcoder/CANdi™/CANrange can be used as
  a remote limit switch.
- Ensure that addInstrument() and loadMusic() are not called periodically, as they
  are blocking functions.
- Playback can be safely enabled during robot disable by enabling the Allow Music
  Dur Disable config.
- This feature requires the device to be Pro licensed.
- Closed-loop control relies on PID and feedforward parameters configured via Tuner
  Configs or in code.
- Gravity feedforward Kg is used to overcome gravity in elevators and arms.
- set velocity to 8 rps, add 0.5 V to overcome gravity
- Uses feedforward term to account for gravity or friction.
- Motion Magic® supports modifying cruise velocity, acceleration, and jerk on the
  fly (requires firmware version 24.0.6.0 or newer).
- Dynamic Motion Magic® requires a Pro-licensed Talon FX connected to a CANivore.
- The following parameters must be set when controlling using Motion Magic® Velocity
- Acceleration - controls acceleration and deceleration rates during the beginning
  and end of motion
- Jerk (optional) - controls jerk, which is the derivative of acceleration
- 'Important: FusedCANcoder and SyncCANcoder require Pro licensing.'
- Some swerve features, such as simulation support, are only available for FRC users.
- All devices in the swerve drivetrain must be on the same CAN bus.
- Both sets of gains need to be tuned to your individual robot
- This needs to be tuned to your individual robot
- 'Warning: Using a custom swerve request for the WPILib SwerveControllerCommand is
  not recommended.'
- 'Important: We recommend against using this strategy in competition code, as it
  does not benefit from the built-in control optimizations.'
- Swerve simulation is only supported for FRC users.
- The API supports a functionality focused simulation.
- Multiple CAN buses using the CANivore API is not supported at this time.
- While the Python API does support simulation, it currently does not hook into WPILib’s
  simulation GUI at this time.
- CTR Electronics supported actuators implement WPILib Motor Safety.
- It’s recommended to set supply voltage to RobotController.getBatteryVoltage() to
  take advantage of WPILib’s BatterySim API.
- This documentation assumes that the user is utilizing a command-based robot program.
- Characterization applies a scaling (quasistatic) or constant (dynamic) voltage to
  the motor.
- There may be a short delay between enabling the robot and the simulated actuators
  being enabled. Unit tests should delay for ~100ms after constructing all devices
  and enabling the robot to account for this delay.
- There may be a short delay between sending a control request and the simulated device
  applying the control. Unit tests should delay for ~20ms after sending a control
  request to account for this delay.
- The name of the native roboRIO CAN bus is 'rio'. This is also the default CAN bus
  on the roboRIO when none is specified.
- When working with CANivore CAN buses in a robot program, Phoenix prints some messages
  to report the state of the CANivore connection.
- Any motors/actuators that have been connected to a roboRIO CAN Bus at any time must
  be factory defaulted due to them being FRC Locked.
- A CAN bus requires two termination resistors, one at each extreme end. If only one
  is present, communication over CAN may fail.
- Tuner X does not require v6 and can be used with v5 flashed devices.
- This doesn’t cover all the factors that impact odometry, but it includes some of
  the major ones that contribute significantly to odometry error.
- The Limelight pose measurements are not latency-compensated, so they will lag behind
  the odometry pose.
- The ID of the device does not need to be valid to run diagnostics.
- CANivore is highly recommended for Linux systems.
- Windows systems require a CANivore to communicate with hardware.
- When different update frequencies are specified for signals that share a status
  frame, the highest update frequency of all the relevant signals will be applied
  to the entire frame.
- Phoenix 6 enhances the experience of using onboard closed-loop control through the
  use of standardized units and a variety of control output types.
- The default port for the diagnostic server is 1250. FRC users should not change
  this.
- Current limits must be enabled and configured.
- Device objects have a getConfigurator() method that returns a device-specific Configurator
  object.
- Phoenix 6 utilizes the Java units library and C++ units library when applicable.
  Using the Java units library may increase GC overhead.
- Increasing signal frequency will also increase CAN bus utilization, which can cause
  indeterminate behavior at high utilization rates (>90%).
- Uses opt-in model for status signals to maximize reduction in bus utilization.
- Clearing sticky faults is a blocking operation and should not be run in a periodic
  loop.
- The TalonFX + Kraken X60 does not support hardware limit switches.
- When utilizing a CANcoder as a remote limit, the limit will trigger when the magnet
  strength changes from BAD (red) to ADEQUATE (orange) or GOOD (green).
- When utilizing a CANrange as a remote limit, the limit will trigger when the proximity
  detect is tripped following the ProximityParamsConfigs.
- When utilizing a CANdi™ as a remote limit, the limit will trigger when the S1Closed
  or S2Closed signal is true.
- Field Oriented Control (FOC) requires Pro licensing.
- Closed-loop control relies on PID and feedforward parameters.
- Manual tuning process involves setting gains to zero and adjusting for desired output.
- set velocity to 8 rps
- add 0.5 V to overcome gravity
- The control request object has an optional feedforward term that can be used to
  add an arbitrary value to the output.
- Motion Magic supports modifying cruise velocity, acceleration, and jerk on the fly
  (requires firmware version 24.0.6.0 or newer).
- Dynamic Motion Magic requires Pro license and CANivore.
- Cruise velocity parameters are set in the control request.
- Phoenix 6 supports the Java units library when applicable.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires tuning of individual robot parameters.
- Drivetrain control is handled using SwerveRequest implementations.
- We recommend against using a custom swerve request for the WPILib SwerveControllerCommand,
  as it does not follow modern WPILib best practices.
- 'Characterization Can Be Dangerous: Always use caution when mechanisms are moving
  and ensure that the robot can be disabled swiftly at any time!'
- 'Ensure Adequate Space: If the mechanism is continuous (swerve azimuth or a flywheel),
  then this is not an issue.'
- Comprehensive API usage examples and tutorials.
- Default CAN bus on the roboRIO is 'rio' when none is specified.
- If there are multiple CANivores with the same name, the system will use the first
  CANivore found.
- On Windows and non-FRC Linux, behavior depends on the platform.
- Factory defaulting can be done in Tuner X and should be done when the CANivore is
  not connected to a roboRIO.
