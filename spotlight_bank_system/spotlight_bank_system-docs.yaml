  - The API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for payment validation. Generate
    a signature by computing hash_hmac('sha256', amount concatenated with identifier,
    YOUR_SECRET_KEY), then compare it with the received signature parameter. Also
    verify that the received identifier matches your expected identifier (YOUR_GIVEN_IDENTIFIER)
    and status equals "success".
