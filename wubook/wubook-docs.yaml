notes:
- You MUST include your API key in every request as a header X-API-KEY.
- The method is asynchronous. In the response, you get an identifier to track the
  success or failure.
- Activating the Whitelabel Standard subscription for a property, and setting the
  webhook preference to ON, WooDoo will not send emails for it anymore, but Wired
  will notify your endpoint.
- If you don't reply HTTP 200 to a webhook, Wired will retry 4 times.
- Uses WooDoo Online Reception API for reservation management.
- The method must be exactly 2.0.
