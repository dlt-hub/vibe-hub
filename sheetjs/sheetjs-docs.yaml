notes:
- This library tries to simplify steps 2 and 4 with functions to extract useful data
  from spreadsheet files (`read` / `readFile`) and generate new spreadsheet files
  from data (`write` / `writeFile`).
- Supports reading and writing a number of spreadsheet file formats.
- The readFile helper method does not work in web browsers.
- The read and readFile functions generate 'sparse' worksheets by default.
- The write functions accept an options argument.
- Workbook objects represent collections of worksheets and associated workbook-level
  metadata.
- The `write` method attempts to package data from the workbook into a file in memory.
- The export file format is determined by the extension of `filename`.
- Fetch and parse workbook examples are provided.
- Streaming write functions are available in the XLSX.stream object.
- Browsers generally do not allow reading files by specifying filename (it is a security
  risk)
- Deno must be run with the --allow-read flag to read from the filesystem
- Creates workbooks from JSON and HTML tables using utility functions.
