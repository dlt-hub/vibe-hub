auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sensay.io:
  - API requests require three headers for authentication. The X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET
    header contains your organization's secret key. The X-USER-ID header specifies
    which user is making the request; omitting it performs the request as an admin.
    The X-API-Version header specifies the API version being used. All three headers
    must be included in requests to the Sensay API endpoints.
  - 'The API requires two authentication headers for all requests: X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET
    (your organization''s secret key) and X-API-Version (the API version). Send both
    headers with every request to the api.sensay.io endpoints.'
  - The API uses an organization Secret Service Token for server-to-server authentication.
    Send the token in the `X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET` header with all requests. Additionally,
    include the `Content-Type` header (required for all requests) and the `X-API-Version`
    header (recommended, set to the API version like `2025-03-25`). The secret token
    should be stored in an environment variable like `ORGANIZATION_SECRET`.
  - 'The API uses header-based authentication with three required headers: X-API-Version
    for the API version, X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET for the organization secret credential,
    and X-USER-ID for identifying the user. These headers must be included in all
    requests to authenticate and authorize access to replica chat endpoints.'
  - 'The API uses the following authentication scheme: send X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET
    header containing an organization secret, X-API-Version header with the API version,
    and X-USER-ID header with the user identifier. All three headers are required
    for requests to authenticate and authorize access to replicas and related resources.'
