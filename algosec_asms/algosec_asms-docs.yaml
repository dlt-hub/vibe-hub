auth_info:
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/latest/asms-help/content/api-guide/afa-rest-web-services.htm:
  - Authentication for AlgoSec Firewall Analyzer APIs uses session-based authentication.
    After logging in, you receive a sessionID value in the login response, which must
    be passed as the session parameter in each subsequent API request. Alternatively,
    you can retrieve your AlgoSec Session ID and PHP Session ID by hovering on the
    AFA home page and typing 'session!' to view session details in a popup.

  : - Authentication is through a session cookie. After logging in via the login method,
      extract the JSESSIONID from the response body and include it in all subsequent
      REST requests using the Cookie header with format "JSESSIONID=<jsessionid>".
      All requests must also include the Content-Type header set to "application/json".
    - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication for login, followed by session-based
      cookie authentication. Send username and password via HTTPBasicAuth to the /login
      endpoint, then extract the jsessionid from the JSON response and include it
      as a JSESSIONID cookie in subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/latest/asms-help/content/api-guide/authenticating.htm:
  - The FireFlow REST API uses cookie-based authentication. Send a POST request to
    /FireFlow/api/authentication/authenticate with username and password in the JSON
    body to obtain a sessionId, faSessionId, and phpSessionId. Use the sessionId to
    manually create a cookie that must be included in all subsequent API requests.
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/latest/asms-help/content/api-guide/logging-in_1.htm:
  - 'The API supports two authentication approaches: (1) Cookie-based session authentication
    via a login endpoint that returns a JSESSIONID, which must be included in a Cookie
    header for subsequent requests, or (2) Basic authentication with a single request
    using an Authorization header containing base64-encoded username:password credentials.
    All requests must include the Content-Type header set to application/json. For
    cookie-based auth, POST to /login with Authorization header Basic <base64(username:password)>,
    receive JSESSIONID in response body, then include Cookie: JSESSIONID=<jsessionid>
    in all following requests. For single-request basic auth, include Authorization:
    Basic <base64(username:password)> directly without logging in first.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/a32.60/asms-help/content/api-guide/managing-issues.htm:
  - Pagination uses query parameters size (required, default 0) and page (required,
    default 0 for first page) to specify page size and page number. The response includes
    a content array and various paging elements following the Spring framework Page
    object structure; see Spring documentation for navigation details.
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/a32.60/asms-help/content/api-guide/networkobject_search_get.htm:
  - Request parameters include page (integer, number of pages in response) and size
    (integer, number of results per page). Use page and size as query parameters to
    paginate through results; increment page to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with page and size query parameters. The
    page parameter (default 0) specifies the page number, and size parameter (default
    50) specifies the number of results per page. The response does not include explicit
    pagination fields like next, has_more, or total_count in the documented response
    parameters.
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/a32.60/asms-help/content/api-guide/retrieving-service-objects.htm:
  - Use query parameters size (optional, default 10) and page (optional, default 1)
    to paginate results. Response includes totalPages, totalElements, currPageNumber,
    and currPageElements to track pagination state. Construct next request by incrementing
    page parameter until currPageNumber reaches totalPages.
- information_source; https://techdocs.algosec.com/en/asms/a32.60/asms-help/content/api-guide/nat-rules_get.htm:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageNumber (default 0 for first page)
    and pageSize (default 50) to request specific pages. The response includes totalPages,
    pageNumber, and pageSize fields to indicate pagination state and construct subsequent
    requests.
