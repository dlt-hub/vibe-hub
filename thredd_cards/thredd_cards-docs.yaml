auth_info:
- information_source; https://cardsapidocs.thredd.com/reference/using-postman:
  - The Thredd REST API uses OAuth2 for authentication. Generate an OAuth token at
    the collection level using the "Get New Access Token" button in the Authorization
    tab, then the token is automatically applied to all endpoints. Additionally, most
    endpoints use a publicToken variable (obtained from card creation responses) that
    must be set in the collection's Variables tab for subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://cardsapidocs.thredd.com/v0.0/reference/using-postman:
  - The API uses a publicToken as the primary identifier for card-related requests.
    The publicToken should be set as a variable (typically in the Variables tab of
    a Postman collection) and is then used in subsequent API calls. Additionally,
    an access token must be generated and included in requests to authenticate with
    the Thredd API.
  - The Thredd API uses OAuth2 for authentication. To authenticate, you need to provide
    a client_id and client_secret, which are entered as variables in the Postman collection
    (in the Initial Value and Current Value fields). These credentials are then used
    to generate an OAuth access token via the "Get New Access Token" flow at the collection
    level, and the resulting token is automatically applied to all endpoints in the
    collection.
- information_source; https://cardsapidocs.thredd.com/v2/docs/accessing-api-hub:
  - CloudEntity acts as an Authorisation Server managing access to the REST API. Access
    requires requesting an access token through CloudEntity's OAuth2-like flow. Certificates
    (Transport, Signing, and Encryption) managed via Raidiam Connect are used for
    establishing secure connections, signing messages for client authentication, and
    encrypting payloads.
  - Thredd's API uses OAuth2-style token-based authentication. Request an access token
    from the Get Access Token endpoint; the returned access_token is a JWT valid for
    10 minutes and includes application-associated scopes. Use this token in subsequent
    API requests to access protected resources. Base URLs are https://api.thredd.com/
    for production and https://uat-api.thredd.com/ for UAT. Integration with Thredd's
    Secure Connectivity Framework is required as a prerequisite.
