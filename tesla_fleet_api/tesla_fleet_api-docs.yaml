auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/partner-endpoints:
  - Partner authentication token is required for certain endpoints. The token should
    be sent as a bearer token in the Authorization header. Specific details on how
    to obtain and use the partner authentication token are referenced in the partner-tokens
    documentation.
- information_source; https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands:
  - Commands sent to vehicles must be signed with a virtual key before being passed
    to Fleet API. The Vehicle Command Proxy handles this signing automatically when
    it receives requests. If a command is not signed, the vehicle will reject the
    request. Virtual keys are installed on vehicles as applications to authorize command
    execution, with full details available in the virtual keys developer guide.
- information_source; https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints:
  - JWS token authentication using Schnorr signatures with NIST P-256 and SHA-256.
    The token must be crafted manually if not using the vehicle-command proxy, which
    automatically signs requests with the configured private key.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints:
  - The share_invites endpoint (GET /api/1/vehicles/{vehicle_tag}/invitations) is
    paginated with a maximum page size of 25 records. However, the documentation does
    not specify the pagination parameters (such as page, offset, limit, cursor) or
    response fields (such as next, has_more, total_count) needed to navigate pages.
  - This endpoint is paginated with a default page size of 100 vehicles. Use query
    parameters page and per_page to control pagination; the response includes total_count
    to indicate the total number of vehicles available.
