  - 'An API key from your Hub account is required to authenticate to v2 of the API.
    The API key must be provided to access endpoints, with access levels and accessible
    Projects varying based on the account type (Subscribed Institution, Subscribed
    Researcher, Confirmed Community, Certified Integration Partner, or Unsubscribed/Unauthorized).


    However, the documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter name,
    or method for transmitting the API key in requests. To use this API from Python,
    you would need to contact support@localcontexts.org for details on how to include
    the API key in your requests (e.g., as an Authorization header, X-API-Key header,
    query parameter, etc.).'

    The API key must be provided to make authenticated requests; access and permissions

  - An API key from your Hub account is required to authenticate to the Local Contexts
    Hub API v2. The API key should be associated with your Hub account and access
    to endpoints and Projects varies based on account type and subscription status.
    Unsubscribed, unconfirmed, or uncertified accounts without an API key cannot access
    most endpoints.

  - An API key from your Hub account is required to authenticate to the API. The API
    key is associated with the Hub account in which it was generated and determines
    what calls and Projects are accessible. API keys should be sent with requests
    to authenticate access, with different account types (Subscribed Institution,
    Subscribed Researcher, Confirmed Community, Certified Integration Partner, or
    Unsubscribed/Unauthorized) having different permission levels for various endpoints.

    key is associated with the Hub account that generated it and determines access
    permissions based on account type (Subscribed Institution, Subscribed Researcher,

    Send the API key in your request to authenticate and access Projects and endpoints
    according to your account's authorization level.
