auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.sayari.com/api/api-clients/go:
  - Sayari Graph API uses client ID and secret credentials for authentication. The
    SDK's Connect function accepts a client ID and secret to create an authenticated
    API client that handles both initial authentication and re-authentication for
    long-lived sessions.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Clients must first call an authentication
    endpoint to obtain a bearer token, then include this token in the Authorization
    header of all subsequent API requests. The SDK automatically handles token management
    including rotation before expiration, but when using the API directly, you must
    manually request the token from the authentication endpoint and add it to each
    request.
  - The Sayari Graph API uses OAuth2-style client credentials authentication. You
    must provide CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET credentials supplied by Sayari to authenticate
    requests made through the SDK. These credentials are used by the SDK to obtain
    access tokens for API calls.
- information_source; https://documentation.sayari.com/api/key-concepts/authentication:
  - The Sayari API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with JWT bearer tokens.
    Obtain a token by posting client_id, client_secret, audience set to "sayari.api",
    and grant_type set to "client_credentials" to https://api.sayari.com/oauth/token.
    Include the returned access_token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token
    for all API requests. Tokens expire after 86400 seconds and must be refreshed
    by obtaining a new token.
