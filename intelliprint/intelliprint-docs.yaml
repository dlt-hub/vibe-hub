auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.intelliprint.net/api:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' with Content-Type application/json.
- information_source; https://www.intelliprint.net/api-docs:
  - API key authentication is required for all requests. Generate your API key in
    the developer dashboard and include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    YOUR_API_KEY". Optionally, set the testmode parameter to true in request bodies
    to use the sandbox environment for testing without cost.
  - 'API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. The API key is passed as the username
    in the `-u` parameter with an empty password (format: `key_EXAMPLE:`). The key
    should be prefixed with `key_` and sent in the Authorization header as Base64-encoded
    Basic Auth credentials.'
  - API keys are provided in the Authorization header using HTTP Bearer authentication.
    Set the Authorization header to "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". There are no separate test
    mode API keys; instead, set the testmode parameter to true when creating a test
    Print Job.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token required. Send API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". Keep API keys secure and never expose them in
    client-side code. If compromised, generate a new key from the dashboard.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.intelliprint.net/api-docs:
  - Pagination for listing Print Jobs uses limit and skip parameters. The limit parameter
    specifies the number of Print Jobs to return per request, and skip specifies the
    number of results to offset. Both are query parameters; use skip to move through
    pages by incrementing the offset value.
  - 'The List Backgrounds endpoint uses query parameters for pagination: limit (number
    of backgrounds to return) and skip (number of results to skip). The response returns
    a list of background objects; continue paginating by incrementing the skip parameter
    until fewer than limit results are returned.'
  - Use the limit query parameter to control page size (example shows limit=1). The
    response includes total_available for total items and has_more boolean to indicate
    if more pages exist; continue paginating while has_more is true, but the documentation
    does not specify how to request subsequent pages.
