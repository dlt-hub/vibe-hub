auth_info:
- information_source; https://invisioncommunity.com/developers/rest-api/index/:
  - "API Key authentication is sent via HTTP Basic Auth with the API key as the username\
    \ and no password. OAuth access tokens are alternatively available and provide\
    \ user-specific access; some endpoints require one method or the other. API Keys\
    \ are generated in AdminCP under System \u2192 REST & OAuth \u2192 API Keys and\
    \ must be configured per endpoint. Client Credentials OAuth grant is also supported\
    \ as an alternative to API Keys for full API access."
  - API key authentication or OAuth 2.0 (version 4.3+) are required. API keys grant
    full access to all data and actions; OAuth is available in version 4.3 and above.
    Requests are sent directly to each community's API instance, not a central location.
  - OAuth authentication is used with scopes to control endpoint access. Obtain an
    access token via OAuth grant flow (typically authorization code grant) and send
    it in the Authorization header as "Bearer {accessToken}". Client Identifiers are
    32 characters, Client Secrets are 48 characters, Authorization Codes are 64 characters,
    and Access Tokens are 97 characters long. Scopes are configured in AdminCP to
    determine which endpoints each OAuth client can access.
- information_source; https://invisioncommunity.com/news/invision-community/new-additional-rest-api-endpoints-r1020/:
  - Access for API endpoints is configured via API keys generated in the admin control
    panel. Each API key has granular permissions configured through the admin control
    panel that control which endpoints and content items the key can access. Permissions
    are assigned per API key for nodes and other resources.
