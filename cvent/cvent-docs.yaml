auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/rest-api/tutorials/developer-quickstart:
  - Cvent REST API uses OAuth 2.0 with the client credentials flow. To authenticate,
    POST to {hostName}/ea/oauth2/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    header, Authorization Basic header containing base64-encoded client credentials,
    grant_type=client_credentials in the body, and your client_id in the body. The
    response provides a Bearer Token used for subsequent API requests. Scopes like
    event/contact control access to specific data domains and must be assigned to
    your application during setup.
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/rest-api/guides/compliance-guide:
  - Grant your workspace and application the communications:read and communications:write
    scopes to interact with the Compliance APIs. The API requires scope-based authorization
    where these two scopes must be assigned to enable access to compliance endpoints
    for retrieving and configuring communication logs.
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/rest-api/guides/obfuscation-guide:
  - Access token authentication is required. The `{accessToken}` must be retrieved
    from a prior Authentication request and used in API calls. Contact read and write
    permissions are required for obfuscation operations; if a 403 error occurs, verify
    these scopes are enabled in your workspace and application configuration.
  - 'Access tokens are required and must be sent in the Authorization header as a
    Bearer token. The access token is obtained through an Authentication request (details
    at the linked Authentication section). Include the token in all API requests using
    the header format: Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. The access
    token must be retrieved from a prior Authentication request and included as Authorization:
    Bearer {accessToken} in all API requests.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/rest-api/guides/compliance-guide:
  - Use query parameters page and per_page to paginate through messages. The GET /logs/communication/messages
    endpoint returns paginated results; specify page (starting at 1) and per_page
    to control pagination. The POST /logs/communication/messages/filter endpoint also
    supports pagination with these same parameters for filtered message retrieval.
  - Use the `before` and/or `after` query parameters in the List Communication endpoint
    to retrieve communications during a given period. Messages are stored for 30 days
    only, so retrieve data regularly to ensure retention.
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/legacy-api/csn/planner-guide/searching-rfps:
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, number of records requested) and searchAfter (UUID,
    used to retrieve subsequent result sets). The searchAfter value from a previous
    response is passed in the next request to continue pagination.
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/legacy-api/jifflenow-api/meeting/meetings-list-meeting-centric:
  - Meetings List API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (required,
    default 1) and per_page (required, default 10) to control pagination. The response
    includes page numbers and total entries to help determine when pagination is complete.
- information_source; https://developers.cvent.com/docs/legacy-api/jifflenow-api/meeting/meetings-list-user-centric:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters api_params[page] (default 1) and api_params[per_page]
    (default 10) to control page number and users per page. The response structure
    does not explicitly show pagination metadata fields like total_count or has_more,
    so stopping condition is unclear from this documentation.
