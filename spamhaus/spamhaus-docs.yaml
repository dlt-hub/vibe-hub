notes:
- This API is limited to submissions sent in the last 30 days.
- Use of the Community Portal is for contributors acting in good faith to make the
  internet safer.
- Spamhaus detects malicious or abusive use of the portal in any way, we reserve the
  right to revoke a contributorâ€™s access to the API.
- The beta nature of the Threat Intel Community Portal
- Currently in beta, with ongoing improvements expected until the end of 2024
- API for multiple submissions requires account creation
- Accounts can be opened to remove the requirement of verifying your email address
  for each submission.
- Authentication for accounts can be done via GitHub, Google and LinkedIn.
- Cookies are used to control access to pages and database records.
- Once authenticated submissions can be made via an API using a token for authentication.
- By making a submission you confirm that you have the authorization to possess and
  share that data.
- Submissions which we believe have been made in bad faith to discredit individuals,
  organizations or disrupt lawful activities will be blocked and access to the platform
  will be denied.
