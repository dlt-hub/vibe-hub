auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.bigchange.com/docs/rest/api-reference:
  - The BigChange API uses Bearer token authentication. Retrieve an access token from
    the auth endpoint, then pass it as a Bearer token in the authorization header
    of every API request. Additionally, include a customer-id header in every request
    to specify which customer's data to access. The customer-id value can be found
    on the API Key Management page of the Developer Portal.
- information_source; https://developers.bigchange.com/docs/category/rest/auth-proxy/v-2-0-0/authentication:
  - OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant is used to obtain an access token for authenticating
    your application with the BigChange REST API. The specific details on how to request
    and use the token are provided in the "Get an access token" documentation page.
- information_source; https://developers.bigchange.com/docs/rest/api-reference/get-a-resource:
  - API key authentication via the Customer-Id header. Requests require the Customer-Id
    header with an int64 value. The endpoint also mentions a required scope resources:read,
    indicating OAuth2 or token-based authorization is used alongside the Customer-Id
    header.
  - The BigChange API uses Bearer token authentication with JWT format. Include the
    access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for all requests.
