auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc.wwre.workwave.com/:
  - API key authentication is required, passed as a query parameter named "key" with
    the value set to your AUTH_KEY.
  - 'Authentication uses an API key passed via the X-WorkWave-Key header or key query
    parameter. Include X-WorkWave-Key: AUTH_KEY in request headers or ?key=AUTH_KEY
    in the query string.'
  - Authentication uses an API key provided by WorkWave. The key must be included
    in HTTP(S) requests either as the key query-string parameter or via the X-WorkWave-
    header (documentation appears incomplete but indicates a custom header starting
    with X-WorkWave-).
  - 'The API uses API key authentication passed in two ways: as a query parameter
    named key with value AUTH_KEY, or as an HTTP header named X-WorkWave-Key with
    the same AUTH_KEY value. Either method is acceptable for authentication.'
  - The API uses API key authentication via the X-WorkWave-Key header. Include the
    header X-WorkWave-Key with your authentication key value in all requests to wwre.workwave.com.
