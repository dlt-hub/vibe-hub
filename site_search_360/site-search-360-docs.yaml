notes:
- You can manage your API keys directly from your Site Search 360 account.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- No need to touch the code ever again after publishing changes.
- The quality of your search results depends on the quality of your search index.
- The sitemap XML file must be formatted correctly for the crawler to process it.
- You can use Website Crawling and Sitemap Indexing at the same time.
- Crawler settings can help address missing, unwanted, or duplicate pages.
- Settings can optimize crawling time.
- Canonical tags are a great strategy to avoid duplicate results not only in your
  internal site search, but also in Google and other search engines.
- The setting cannot be applied safely if you use query parameters for pagination
  or to identify pages.
- After adjusting any crawler settings, save your changes and re-index your site.
- Keep in mind that the number of pages you have in the sitemap will still affect
  the indexing time.
- The URL list has a limit of 1000 pages, because their primary purpose is indexing
  small batches of pages that aren't found on the site or in the sitemap.
- Whitelist our crawler's IP addresses so it can access all pages without a login
  (under Firewall > Tools)
- Provide a special sitemap.xml with deep links to the hidden content
- 'Detect our crawler with the following User Agent string in the HTTP header: Mozilla/5.0
  (compatible; SiteSearch360/1.0; +https://sitesearch360.com/)'
- 'Add another User Agent for our JavaScript crawler if you need JS-rendered content
  to appear in your search results: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
  (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36'
- Push your content to our HTTP REST API
- Custom login screens can’t be used alongside JavaScript crawling.
- JavaScript crawling is an add-on feature.
- JS crawling isn't enabled for free trial accounts by default.
- JavaScript crawling takes more time and more resources to index JavaScript-rendered
  content.
- Client Error 499 means that the client closed the connection before the server could
  answer the request (often because of a timeout).
- If whitelisting our crawler IP addresses and allowing us as a User Agent haven't
  helped, the issue may be related to your HTTP method settings.
- Enhanced API key management available under Account > API Access
- Existing API keys will remain valid until the end of 2025 as a precautionary measure.
- The Control Panel is your main hub for all things Site Search 360.
- Primary and secondary colors will NOT affect your existing search bar as we do not
  override the search input styles brought by your website theme or template.
- The default (and recommended) level is 2.
- Filters are only available to those on the HOLMES plan and higher
- 'Important: you have to re-index your entire site to see the new data points.'
- Don't forget to re-index your entire site to let the changes take effect.
- Result Groups are mutually exclusive.
- Starting with version 13 of the search script, Result Groups are displayed as tabs
  by default.
- You can use CSS selectors or XPath to adjust your search result titles.
- To change images, add or update Open Graph (og:image) meta tags.
- Primary and secondary colors will NOT affect your existing search bar
- Search box & Search button selectors point at the search bar on your site
- The SS360 script is supposed to go before the closing </body> tag.
- Last four digits of the script vary from project to project.
- Shows implementation errors if set to true
- Whether to allow the SS360 search script to set cookies
- Incremental updates are also possible. A full update should be run once a night
  to ensure a consistent dataset.
- Permissions are managed on the account level, meaning all permissions granted to
  the users are given for all projects under the same account.
- The Site Search 360 plugin for WordPress makes the integration seamless and code-free.
- Suggestions are not counted against your search quota
- Results are rendered in an overlay popup by default
- Database mode indexes directly from WordPress and WooCommerce databases.
- Crawler mode scans source code of each page for indexing.
- Make sure to publish/republish your site when you first install the widget - this
  will initiate a full crawl of your site and add all available pages from it to your
  search results.
- PDF Indexing is only available for our paid plans - 'Columbo' and 'Holmes'. The
  size limit in both cases is 15 MB.
- You'll need to republish the site each time any configuration changes are implemented.
  This will trigger a full re-index, after which the search’s functionality will be
  updated accordingly.
- There is no Free trial that will allow you to explore the search’s capabilities
  in the full glory of our most sophisticated 'Batman' plan
- The Free plan is limited to 10 pages; 'Columbo', in its turn, is limited to 200
- Search needs to be added and set up separately for desktop, tablet and mobile
- Results can only be shown in overlay - they can’t be embedded or displayed fullscreen
- PDFs can only be indexed if they are listed in a separate sitemap
- 'Paid plans are a lot cheaper: manually integrated ''Columbo'' and ''Holmes'' will
  cost you $9 and $49 per month respectively while with Duda the exact same monthly
  plans will go down to $5 and $30'
- Normally, 'Columbo' projects come with our branding both in the search results and
  the search suggestions, while Duda 'Columbo' removes all branding from the search
- To update your manually integrated search, you’ll need to either wait for the next
  scheduled re-crawl or manually re-index the search - with Duda you can simply republish
  the site, and all configuration changes will be instantly reflected in the search
- With Duda no coding is required neither to integrate the search nor to customize
  it
- Content extraction happens automatically thanks to Duda’s default sitemaps, and
  the widget can even create result groups for your products and blog posts right
  out of the box
- You can either install the app right away or check out our demo store via the 'View
  demo store' link on the landing page to get a clearer picture of all the cool features
  you can expect to implement to your search.
- For the vast majority of Site Search 360 projects YouTube Indexing is a paid add-on.
  Shopify users, however, have it enabled by default for as long as our “Free Start”
  welcome plan is active.
- If you want the search to be available in the exact same place on every page of
  your site, you need to choose a selector that is present on all of them.
- You don’t need to activate the search to test out its settings.
- By default all plans come with a PDF size limit of 15 MB.
- Make sure you index all your products when you first crawl your eStore before you
  fully test it.
- Make sure to use your siteId to connect the search to your account.
- API key can be found in your control panel
- Items 2, 3, and 6 can be exported as .CSV by clicking on Export.
- The optimal level differs from site to site as it is related to the type of your
  site content and depends on what your users search for the most.
- Regardless of the fuzziness level, the best-matching results are always shown at
  the top.
- If you want to use Meta Descriptions in your snippets, select the option 'Use content
  behind search snippet XPath'.
- You need to run a full re-index when you set a different Search Snippet XPath.
- Boosting can be set between -100 and 100, advisable to use levels of 10.
- PDF crawling is available in all paid plans with a default maximum size of one PDF
  document - 15 MB.
- When you test your search by using the search bar in Search Preview, these test
  queries are not logged either.
- The upgrade process is totally free and extremely easy.
- Once you replace the old scripts with one line of code just this once, all subsequent
  changes to your search interface and settings will be handled directly in the SS360
  Control Panel.
