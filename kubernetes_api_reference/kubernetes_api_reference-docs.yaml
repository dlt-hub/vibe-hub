notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Understanding GitHub App Authentication
- Do not use a shell if you can avoid it.
- It’s typical to want to take stdin input from your Python code, but oftentimes you
  want to modify it before passing it into your subprocess.
- I was recently wrestling with `pip install cryptography` on Fedora 25.
- I had followed the cryptography documentations and installed the referenced dependencies.
- The resolution is to also install the `redhat-rpm-config` package.
- This can take a long time. For example, on a 4 TB disk it can take about 12 hours
  on typical hardware.
- This seems like a small change, but it’s a big leap in UX for me!
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The Inhibit method allows for event handling during shutdown.
- The AddMatch method listens for the PrepareForShutdown signal.
- Unnecessary reliability is a high cost.
- This is very possible with Vim as well, but personally speaking Lua has opened up
  a ton more doors and interest in customizing my Vim experience.
- Uses Azure Monitor to collect logs from systemd journal through syslog.
- Meant to replace all other agents that exist today for a similar purpose.
- Consolidates features and provides more capabilities.
- The package gives the end user a random quote by making an HTTP request to a well-known
  quote-of-the-day endpoint.
- The node's readiness state is determined by checks from the kubelet.
- The communication between the node and the control plane is initiated by the kubelet.
- This script is current in alpha and should not be run in a production environment.
- Currently only supports virtual machine scale set agent node pools.
- Uses Azure Logic Apps to schedule AKS cluster start and stop.
- Uses make as build interface for tests.
- e2e tests are executed in shell scripts.
- Helm hooks are an anti-pattern and should be avoided in most cases.
- Declarative becomes imperative when using hooks.
- If you don't want Helm to manage your application, consider generating templates
  and applying them directly.
- Each chapter gets its own directory named chapter_<number>
- Use of make for building and managing the book
- Dynamic targets are commonly used with Kubernetes.
- Uses Azure Key Vault to manage TLS/SSL certificates.
- Requires a preferred Certificate Authority for non-partnered issuers.
- If you do find your embedded ad hoc Python code getting long, it’s probably a good
  idea to move that to a separate file so that it can be properly tested and maintained.
- Certificates expiring can cause unexpected outages.
- Understanding the behavior of append in Go slices can prevent unintended side effects.
- Using make and copy can help control modifications to slice data.
- The root cause of this error message is that your private key and your certificate
  do not match when trying to enable SSL in your nginx instance.
- To verify the private and public key nginx will compare the modulus of each.
- If they don’t match, you will get this error.
- xargs is a utility that takes standard input and can dynamically build and execute
  commands.
- Uses mTLS for encrypted network traffic between pods.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''echo hello world'''
- 'sleep: missing operand Try ''sleep --help'' for more information.'
- gcc error when attempting to install the cryptography package.
- 'NotReady: The node is not ready due to kubelet checks failing.'
- 'Unknown: The node-lifecycle-controller hasn''t heard from the node.'
