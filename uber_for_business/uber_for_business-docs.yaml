auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.uber.com/docs/vouchers/guides/authentication:
  - OAuth2 authentication using client credentials or authorization code grant types.
    For client credentials, POST to https://auth.uber.com/oauth/v2/token with form-encoded
    client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to client_credentials, and optional scope
    parameter; returns Bearer token in access_token field. For authorization code
    flow, use grant_type authorization_code with client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri,
    code, and scope parameters. Rate limit is 100 token requests per hour for client
    credentials; after 100 tokens, new tokens invalidate the oldest one.
  - 'Uber uses OAuth2 for authentication with two grant types: client_credentials
    or authorization_code. Tokens are obtained from https://auth.uber.com/oauth/v2/token
    and passed in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens. Available scopes include
    organizations.voucher_programs, organizations.voucher_programs.delegated, and
    vouchers.redeem, which control permissions for voucher program and code management
    operations.'
- information_source; https://developer.uber.com/docs/vouchers/guides/webhooks:
  - Webhook messages are signed using HMAC-SHA256. The X-Uber-Signature header contains
    a hexadecimal HMAC signature of the webhook HTTP request body, computed using
    the primary webhook URL's signing key as the HMAC key and SHA256 as the hash function.
    Verify signatures in Python by computing hmac.new(client_secret, webhook_body,
    hashlib.sha256).hexdigest() and comparing against the X-Uber-Signature header
    value.

  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required with the `organizations.voucher_programs`
    scope. Send the access token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <access_token>`.
- information_source; https://developer.uber.com/docs/vouchers/references/api/v1/sandbox-run-get:
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>" and ensure the token has the organizations.voucher_programs
    scope.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://developer.uber.com/docs/vouchers/references/api/v1/organizations-organization_id-voucher-programs-voucher_program_id-guests-get
  : - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional) to specify number of results
      per page and page_token (query parameter, optional) to navigate pages. The response
      includes a next_token field; use this value as the page_token parameter in the
      next request to retrieve the following page.
    - The response includes a `next_token` field with value "2" used for pagination.
      To retrieve the next page, pass this token value as a query parameter in the
      subsequent request. Continue paginating until no `next_token` is returned in
      the response.
    - Use query parameters limit (page size) and page_token (cursor) to paginate through
      guests. The response includes a next_token field; pass this value as page_token
      in the next request to retrieve the following page.
- ? information_source; https://developer.uber.com/docs/vouchers/references/api/v1/organizations-organization_id-voucher-programs-search-post
  : - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters in the request body. The limit parameter
      (example value 10) specifies the number of results per page, and offset parameter
      (example value 0) specifies the starting position. The response contains a results
      array with the paginated data.
    - Pagination uses offset and limit request parameters. The limit parameter (required,
      int) specifies the number of results per page, and offset parameter (required,
      int) specifies the starting position. The response includes voucher_program_id,
      name, status, and other program fields, but no explicit next/previous fields
      or has_more indicator are documented.
