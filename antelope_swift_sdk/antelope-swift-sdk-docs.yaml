notes:
- Antelope is customizable to suit a wide range of business needs across industries
  with role-based permissions system and secure application transactions processing.
- The Antelope blockchain framework is flexible and can be changed to suit business
  case requirements.
- Core blockchain features are implemented inside smart contracts.
- Docker Utilities for Node Execution (DUNE) is a tool to abstract over Leap programs,
  CDT, and other services/tools.
- The wallet of DUNE is not in any way designed to be a 'secure' wallet.
- All commands that use the container will automatically create a new container if
  one does not exist and automatically start the container if it is stopped.
- The default wallet is created for you and always unlocked when using this system.
- Softkey Signature Provider stores keys in memory and is therefore not secure. It
  should only be used for development purposes.
- Attempts are made to marshall the responses into convenient Swift structs.
- Basic submission of a transaction is shown in the main README.md file at the top
  level of the repository.
- These examples use the Softkey Signature Provider, which is NOT recommended for
  production use.
- Response structs are currently incomplete.
errors:
- 'Unknown command: Check the command syntax or help documentation.'
