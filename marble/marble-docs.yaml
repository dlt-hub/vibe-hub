auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.checkmarble.com/reference/intro-getting-started:
  - All endpoints in the Marble API require authentication using an API key generated
    in the Marble app under Settings > API keys. The API key must be sent as a bearer
    token in the authorization header with the format "Bearer theapikey".
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer theapikey` with each request to the v1beta endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.checkmarble.com/reference/intro-getting-started:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with an `after` query parameter. The response
    includes a `has_more` boolean field; when true, use the `cursor` value from the
    response as the `after` parameter in the next request to fetch the next page.
    Some endpoints support optional `limit` (number of items) and `order` (ASC or
    DESC) parameters to control pagination size and sorting.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with an optional `after` query parameter.
    When `has_more` is true in the `pagination` response object, pass the `next_page_id`
    value as the `after` query parameter in the next request to fetch the next page.
    Stop paginating when `has_more` is false.
