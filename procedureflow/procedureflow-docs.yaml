auth_info:

  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, I can identify authentication information:


    Basic authentication is required using the format "id:token" passed via the --user
    flag in curl, which translates to an Authorization header with Basic auth scheme.
    The example shows the credential format as "2:pfpat_dxPhkx4i9uvSE" where the token
    appears to be a ProcedureFlow personal access token (pfpat prefix). Additionally,
    the endpoint requires specific permissions such as "Change requests - Write" to
    perform updates.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication using user credentials in the format "user:api_key".
    The example shows credentials "2:pfpat_dxPhkx4i9uvSE" passed via the --user flag,
    which translates to the Authorization header with base64-encoded "user:password"
    format (HTTP Basic Auth).
  - Basic authentication is required using the format `--user "api_id:api_token"`
    where credentials are passed as `api_id:api_token`. The example shows `2:pfpat_dxPhkx4i9uvSE`
    format. Additionally, the `Flows (live) - Read` permission is required to access
    this endpoint.
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are passed via the `--user` flag
    in the format `username:password`, where the username is a numeric ID and the
    password is an API token (e.g., `2:pfpat_dxPhkx4i9uvSE`). This translates to an
    HTTP Basic Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials.
  - Basic authentication is required. Use the format `--user "userId:apiToken"` where
    the API token follows the pattern `pfpat_*`. The credentials are sent as HTTP
    Basic Auth in the Authorization header.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://app.procedureflow.com/developers/docs/reference/api:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used for listing users. The optional query parameter
    `page` accepts a cursor returned from a previous response to request the next
    page. The response contains a `data` array with up to 100 users and includes pagination
    metadata to navigate through results.
  - Pagination uses a `page` query parameter to request subsequent pages. The response
    contains a `data` array with up to 100 user objects and a `nextUrl` field providing
    the complete URL for the next page. When no more users are available, the `data`
    array will be empty, indicating the end of pagination.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach via the `page` query parameter. Responses
    include a `nextUrl` field containing the full path for the next page of results.
    Each response returns up to 100 items; when no more items are available, the array
    is empty and `nextUrl` is absent, indicating the end of pagination.
  - ProcedureFlow uses cursor-based pagination with the optional `page` query parameter.
    Responses include a `data` array and a `nextUrl` field; when `nextUrl` is null,
    pagination is complete. Cursors and URLs expire after 24 hours. Page size is not
    configurable.
  - The `page` parameter is an optional query string parameter that accepts a cursor
    returned from a previous response to request the next page. Responses contain
    a pagination response with a `data` array of up to 100 session events; when no
    more events are available, the array is empty.
