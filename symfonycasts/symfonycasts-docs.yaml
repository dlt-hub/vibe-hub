auth_info:
- information_source; https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony-security:
  - Moodle uses cookie-based session authentication. After submitting credentials
    via POST to the login endpoint, the server sets a MoodleSession cookie (e.g.,
    mdnp02a6oa53uqnrs9fr25bdu2) that must be included in subsequent requests. Additionally,
    a MOODLEID1 cookie is set for persistent identification across sessions. Both
    cookies should be sent in the Cookie request header for authenticated requests.
- information_source; https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform-security/access-token-authenticator:
  - 'API tokens are passed as HTTP headers. The authentication mechanism is configured
    in OpenAPI/Swagger via an `api_keys` entry named `access_token` with `type: header`,
    meaning the token should be sent in a request header. The token is validated server-side
    through an `AccessTokenHandlerInterface` implementation that checks token validity
    and retrieves the associated user.'
  - Authentication uses a Bearer token passed via the Authorization header. Configure
    the token name as "access_token" with type "header" and name "Authorization".
    Send requests with the Authorization header formatted as "Bearer {token}" where
    {token} is your API token string. Invalid tokens return a 401 response with an
    invalid_token error header and error_description.
- information_source; https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform-security/open-api-decoration:
  - The API uses HTTP Bearer token authentication. The security scheme is configured
    as type 'http' with scheme 'bearer', and credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header with the format 'Bearer {access_token}'. The token is named 'access_token'
    in the security configuration.
- information_source; https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform-security/security:
  - API token authentication with scope-based access control. Tokens have specific
    scopes (e.g., `SCOPE_TREASURE_CREATE`) that map to roles (e.g., `ROLE_TREASURE_CREATE`).
    Access is granted via `is_granted()` expression language checks if the user either
    logged in via login form (receiving `ROLE_FULL_USER` and inherited roles via `role_hierarchy`
    in `security.yaml`) or authenticated with an API token containing the required
    scope. The system supports fine-grained role-based authorization including ownership
    checks for edit operations.
