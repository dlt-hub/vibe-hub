- information_source; https://www.sumologic.com/help/docs/api/about-apis/getting-started/:
  - Sumo Logic API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an Access ID and Access Key.
    Credentials are sent as a Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header using
    the format "accessId:accessKey" with the -u flag in curl, or as an Authorization
    header with value "Basic base64(accessId:accessKey)". The Access ID and Access
    Key must be generated from the Sumo Logic console and the key is displayed only
    once upon creation.
  - 'Sumo Logic API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an accessId and accessKey.
    Credentials can be sent either via the curl -u flag (which automatically encodes
    them) or manually as a Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header with
    the format "Authorization: Basic <base64(accessId:accessKey)>". The Base64 encoding
    must be of the string "accessId:accessKey" with no extra newlines.'
- information_source; https://www.sumologic.com/help/docs/api/collector-management/collector-api-methods-examples/:
  - Basic authentication using access credentials. Send the accessId and accessKey
    as HTTP Basic Auth in the format `-u 'accessId:accessKey'` in the Authorization
    header (curl handles this with the -u flag). These credentials must be provided
    for all API requests.
  - Basic authentication using accessId and accessKey credentials. Send credentials
    in the Authorization header using the format accessId:accessKey with HTTP Basic
    Auth (base64-encoded), or use curl's -u flag which handles encoding automatically.
  - Sumo Logic Collector API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an access ID and
    access key. Credentials are passed in the Authorization header using the format
    `-u '<accessId>:<accessKey>'` in curl requests, which translates to a Basic auth
    header with base64-encoded "accessId:accessKey" credentials. Additionally, PUT/PATCH
    requests require an ETag header obtained from a prior GET request to manage concurrent
    updates.
