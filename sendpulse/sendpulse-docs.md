In this guide, we'll set up a complete SendPulse data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def sendpulse_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.sendpulse.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "mailing-lists",
            "campaigns",
            "templates"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='sendpulse_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='sendpulse_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(sendpulse_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from sendpulse‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Mailing Lists: Manage and retrieve mailing list information.
- Campaigns: Handle operations related to email campaigns.
- Templates: Operations for managing email templates.
- Senders: Manage sender identities.
- Webhooks: Configure and manage webhooks for event notifications.
- Balance: Retrieve balance and financial transactions details.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from SendPulse workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@sendpulse-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with SendPulse support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:sendpulse duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for SendPulse API, as specified in @sendpulse-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "mailing-lists" and "campaigns" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in sendpulse_pipeline.py and name the pipeline sendpulse_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python sendpulse_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is implemented via OAuth 2.0 with refresh token flow. Tokens are obtained using the client ID and client secret, and must be included in the header for each request.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://sendpulse.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python sendpulse_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline sendpulse load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset sendpulse_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/sendpulse.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline sendpulse_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("sendpulse_pipeline").dataset()
   # get mailing-lists table as Pandas frame
   data.mailing-lists.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

No support for incremental loading; only full sync is supported. Some resources like templates, senders, webhooks, and balance details do not support pagination. It's crucial to ensure that the client_id and client_secret are correct to avoid 401 Unauthorized errors, and proper permissions are set to prevent 403 Forbidden errors.
