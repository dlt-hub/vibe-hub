auth_info:
- information_source; https://meteocontrol.github.io/vcom-api/:
  - Access to the VCOM API requires two authentication methods used together. First,
    provide your VCOM platform credentials using HTTP basic authentication with username
    and password via the -u flag. Second, include your API-Key in the X-API-KEY header.
    Both are required for all requests to the API endpoints.
  - OAuth2 password and refresh token grant flows with API key header. Send POST to
    https://api.meteocontrol.de/v2/login with form-encoded body containing grant_type
    (password or refresh_token), client_id (vcom-api), client_secret (provided secret),
    and x-api-key header. Response includes access_token (Bearer type), refresh_token,
    and expires_in (518400 seconds).
  - OAuth2 password grant flow requiring an API key header. Send POST to /v2/login
    with header x-api-key set to your API key, and form data containing grant_type=password,
    username, password, client_id=vcom-api, and client_secret. The response provides
    an access token for subsequent requests.
  - The API supports OAuth authentication or Basic authentication with an API key.
    For OAuth, include the Authorization header with Bearer <Access Token>. For Basic
    auth, use the Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials (username:password
    format) and include the X-API-KEY header with your API key value. The X-API-KEY
    header is required in both cases.
  - The API supports two authentication methods, both requiring an API-Key header.
    For Basic Authentication, send the X-API-KEY header along with the -u username:password
    curl option (or Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials). For OAuth
    Authentication, send the X-API-KEY header with an Authorization header containing
    "Bearer <Access Token>". The API-Key is obtained from the VCOM administration
    section as a partner, or through partner contacts for developers. Credentials
    (username and password) are the same as used for VCOM itself. Both methods require
    the X-API-KEY header in every request to https://api.meteocontrol.de/v2/ (or https://api.meteocontrol.cn
    for Chinese datacenter clients).
