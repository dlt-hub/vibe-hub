auth_info:
- information_source; https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required for PUT and PATCH requests to update
    secrets. The bearer token must be provided in the Authorization header with the
    format "Authorization: Bearer {token}".'
  - Bearer token authentication is required for all endpoints. Include the token in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}".
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required for the DELETE endpoint. The token must
    be sent in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme (e.g., Authorization:
    Bearer <token>).'
  - 'The API supports three authentication methods depending on the endpoint: Basic
    Authentication using username and password credentials, API Key authentication
    obtained from the `/generate-api-key` endpoint, and Bearer Token authentication
    obtained from the `/get-auth-token` endpoint by providing username and password
    in the request body. The specific authentication method required varies by endpoint.'
  - The API uses token-based authentication acquired via POST /get-auth-token with
    username and password in the request body, returning a token field. The /all endpoint
    requires basic authentication. Send the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}" for protected endpoints.

    the page number until no more results are returned.
