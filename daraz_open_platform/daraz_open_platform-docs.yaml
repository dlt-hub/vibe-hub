  - 'The API uses multiple required authentication parameters sent with each request:
    app_key (unique app ID from the DARAZ Open Platform console), access_token (API
    interface call credentials), timestamp (current UTC time in milliseconds, within
    7200 seconds of server time), sign_method (HMAC hash algorithm name), and sign
    (HMAC signature for request verification). The sign parameter is calculated as
    part of an authentication process that identifies and verifies the request sender.'
