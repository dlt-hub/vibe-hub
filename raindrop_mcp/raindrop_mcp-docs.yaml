auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.liquidmetal.ai/tutorials/netlify-integration/:
  - The Raindrop client requires API key authentication passed during initialization.
    The API key must be provided via the apiKey parameter when instantiating the Raindrop
    client, typically sourced from the RAINDROP_API_KEY environment variable. No additional
    headers, query parameters, or request body auth fields are specified in the documentation.
- information_source; https://docs.liquidmetal.ai/sdk/examples/smartbucket/:
  - 'API key authentication is required, passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The format is "Authorization: Bearer lm_apikey_..." where lm_apikey_...
    is your API key. In the Go SDK, use option.WithAPIKey("Your API Key") when initializing
    the client, and in Java, load credentials from environment variables via RaindropOkHttpClient.fromEnv().'
  - 'API key authentication is required, sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The format is "Authorization: Bearer lm_apikey_..." where the API key
    is prefixed with "lm_apikey_". In the Go SDK, use option.WithAPIKey() to pass
    the key; in Java, use RaindropOkHttpClient.fromEnv() to load from environment
    variables.'
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token with the format "Authorization: Bearer lm_apikey_...". The API
    key should be prefixed with "lm_apikey_".'
  - Authorization is required using a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The
    token format is "Bearer lm_apikey_..." where the API key is prefixed with "lm_apikey_".
    Send this in the Authorization header of POST requests to the search endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.liquidmetal.ai/sdk/examples/smartbucket/:
  - 'Pagination is requested via query parameters in the request body: page (required,
    integer) and page_size (required, integer, default 10). The response contains
    a summary field but does not include pagination metadata such as next, has_more,
    or total_count to indicate whether additional pages exist or how to construct
    the next request.'
  - Pagination uses a request_id parameter in the request body to identify a search
    session. Results include a pagination object with total, page, and pageSize fields.
    Subsequent pages are requested by incrementing the page parameter while keeping
    the same request_id.
- information_source; https://docs.liquidmetal.ai/sdk/examples/smart-memory/:
  - Use page-based pagination with query parameters page (current page number) and
    pageSize (results per page). Response includes pagination object with total count,
    current page number, pageSize, totalPages, and hasMore boolean to determine if
    more results exist.
