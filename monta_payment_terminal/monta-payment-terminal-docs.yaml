notes:
- Strongly recommended to use webhooks to avoid hitting rate-limits.
- We expect a server-to-server integration; your clientId and clientSecret should
  not be part of any frontend (app, web, …).
- Our APIs are rate-limited.
- Bearer token authentication required for all endpoints.
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism.
- Rate limits can be configured for each client credential.
- Webhook events are always scoped at the operator level.
- Strongly recommend including partnerExternalId when initiating a Charge.
- The current API is in its Beta version.
- For the sake of flexibility and extensibility the API only accepts string values.
  Invalid data types (e.g., numbers) will be rejected.
- This is an ever-growing list, and new values can be added, consumers should implement
  the necessary fallbacks.
- Utilize the webhooks system to retrieve updates to charge points.
- API consumers are rate-limited.
- This endpoint is cursor-paginated
- Clients exceeding the limit will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
- Monta actively monitors API usage, and excessive or abnormal activity on Fair Use
  endpoints may lead to temporary rate limiting or other corrective actions.
- To receive events via a webhook, provide an HTTPS endpoint and a secret.
- Please note that we delete any events older than 24 hours.
- Server-to-server integration; clientId and clientSecret should not be part of any
  frontend.
- The signature is generated using HMAC-SHA1 with your webhookSecret as key.
- The URL for this request expired after 30 days.
- 'Required scope: `charge-auth-tokens:read`'
- 'Required scope: charge-auth-tokens:write'
- 'Required scope: `charge-auth-tokens:write`'
- 'Required scope: `charge-auth-tokens:delete`'
- This endpoint will create or update an existing integration, meaning that the existing
  integration will be replaced by a new one
- 'Required scope: charge-points:write'
- Various types of Charge Point states are available.
- Currently only OCPP is supported.
