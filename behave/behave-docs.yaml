notes:
- Added in version 1.2.7.
- A 'debug on error/failure' functionality can easily be provided by using the after_step()
  hook.
- It is in general a good idea to enable this functionality only when needed (in interactive
  mode).
- Tags may be used to control your test run by only including certain features or
  scenarios based on tag selection.
- The tags attached to a feature and scenario are available in the environment functions
  via the 'feature' or 'scenario' object.
- Current default tag expression protocol is auto_detect
- Configuration files must start with the label '[behave]' and are formatted in the
  Windows INI style.
- Fixture-setup errors are special because a cleanup of a fixture is in many cases
  not necessary.
- Command-line definitions take precedence over configuration file settings.
- If the command-line contains no value part, its value becomes 'true'.
- Recreate a new flaskr client before each feature is executed.
- BDD advises your to test WHAT your application should do and not HOW it is done.
- Support for Tag-Expressions v1 was removed.
- The --tags command-line option can now be used only once.
- Support Gherkin v6 grammar
- Use/Support cucumber-tag-expressions
- 'cucumber-tag-expressions are extended by ''tag-matching'' to match partial tag
  names, like: @foo.*'
- Select-by-location for Scenario Containers (Feature, Rule, ScenarioOutline)
- Support for emojis in feature files and steps
- 'Extension Point: Runner'
- Improve Active-Tags Logic
- 'Active-Tags: Use ValueObject for better Comparisons'
- Detect bad step definitions
- Distinguish between Failures and Errors
- Support for Pending Steps
- Step definitions with Cucumber-Expressions
- Improved Logging Support
- Improved Capture Support
- 'Step Decorators: Support for Async-Steps'
- 'Tagged Examples: Examples in a ScenarioOutline can now have tags.'
- Feature model elements have now language attribute based on language tag in feature
  file (or the default language tag that was used by the parser).
- 'Gherkin parser: Supports escaped-pipe in Gherkin table cell value'
- 'Configuration: Supports now to define default tags in configfile'
- 'Configuration: language data is now used as default-language that should be used
  by the Gherkin parser. Language tags in the Feature file override this setting.'
- 'Runner: Can continue after a failed step in a scenario'
- 'Runner: Hooks processing handles now exceptions. Hook errors (exception in hook
  processing) lead now to scenario failures (even if no step fails).'
- Testing support for asynchronuous frameworks or protocols based
- 'Context-cleanups: Register cleanup functions that are executed at the end of the
  test-scope (scenario, feature or test-run) via add_cleanup().'
- 'Fixtures: Simplify setup/cleanup in scenario, feature or test-run'
- Supports async-steps and context-based cleanups.
- Gherkin parser supports escaped-pipe in tables.
- Exclude any with @use.with_browser=<other_browser>
- Active tags mechanism allows scenarios to be excluded at runtime based on tags.
- Use of `@use.with_browser=*` tags becomes active tags.
- Unknown categories, missing in the active_tag_value_provider are ignored.
- You can use more than one formatter during a test run.
- Only supported by JSON formatter.
- Inner parts of behave may change without notice.
- Optional packages helpful for local development.
errors:
- Gherkin Parser strips no longer trailing colon from step
- Capture related command line options changed (some in incompatible ways)
- 'ModuleNotFoundError: Python package with runner is probably not installed yet.'
- 'ClassNotFoundError: Python package is installed but class is not found (maybe:
  misspelled).'
- 'InvalidClassError: Runner class is not valid.'
