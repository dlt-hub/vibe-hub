- File size limit for Multipart Resumable Upload is between 100MB and 100GB.
- When reuploading a video asset to the JWP Platform, the default audio track is re-extracted
  and saved. Any edits to its name, language, or language code must be reapplied.
- Engagement analytics may be inconsistent if you include dates previous to when the
  video was updated.
- Limit your MRSS feed to 1,000 videos.
- Any configuration changes will not apply retroactively to assets that have already

- You can only define a maximum of 50 custom parameters.
- Deleting a default custom parameter is permanent.
- Thumbnail may take up to 15 minutes to appear after choosing a new thumbnail.
- Re-uploading a video using the same media ID uses the previously chosen custom thumbnail.
- JWP removes all sensitive metadata when an image is uploaded to protect privacy
  and ensure user security.
- A motion thumbnail is auto-generated when you upload a video.
- Use high-resolution images for alternate images.

  If you generate the JWT within a client-side native app, you risk exposing your
  API secret.
