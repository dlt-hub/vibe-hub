  - 'API key authentication using Bearer token in Authorization header. Send the API
    key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY'
  - Authentication uses JWT bearer tokens. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer $JWT". The token type is a JSON Web Token (Service Evaluation Token).
  - 'Authentication uses a JWT bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The
    request must include the header "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" where $JWT is a valid
    JSON Web Token (Service Evaluation Token). The token is required for all requests
    to this endpoint.'
  - 'Authentication uses a bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" where $API_KEY is your API key. The
    authorization scheme is identified as "Simple Token" in the API documentation.'
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token scheme. Send credentials as Authorization:
    Bearer $API_KEY header in requests. The API_KEY is a token value that must be

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.nrfcloud.com/:
  - 'Pagination information found: The list endpoint uses offset-based pagination
    with pageNextToken field. Request uses optional query parameters (firmwareType
    filters results). Response includes total count and pageNextToken for fetching
    the next page; use the pageNextToken value in subsequent requests to continue
    pagination.'
  - Pagination is used in the ListAnchors endpoint. Use the query parameter pageNextToken
    (optional) to request the next page of results. The response includes a total
    field indicating the total number of anchors and a pageNextToken field for fetching
    the next page; when pageNextToken is absent, all results have been retrieved.
  - Pagination uses a token-based scheme with a `pageNextToken` field in the response
    containing the token for the next page, and a `total` field indicating the total
    number of items. Use the `pageNextToken` value as a query parameter in the next
    request to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses pageLimit (query parameter, optional, default 10) to control results
    per page and pageNextToken (query parameter, optional string) to navigate to the
    next page. Use the pageNextToken value from the response to fetch subsequent pages.
  - 'The response includes pagination information: use the "pageNextToken" field value
    from the response as the request parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve
    the next page of results. The "total" field indicates the total number of items
    available.'
