notes:
- Some Administration settings are different in the Explore and Present pages.
- For Amazon S3, required permissions include s3:DeleteObject, s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject,
  s3:ListBucket.
- For Azure Blob Storage, required permissions include read, write, and delete blobs,
  list containers and blobs, get container properties.
- For Google Cloud Storage, required permissions include storage.buckets.get and full
  access to the bucket.
- Adverity’s Management API has no rate limits.
- Use UTC time zone in all timestamps in the Management API.
- It is recommended the latitude and longitude values are set to no more than two
  decimal places.
- If you wish to round the latitude and longitude values, ensure the rounding script
  is run before the geolocation-creation script.
- To create a widget, select at least one dimension and one metric.
- Dimensions are displayed in blue.
- Metrics are displayed in green.
- You must fetch data in a datastream, assign a Data Mapping to the fields you want
  to use, and load a data extract containing these fields into Explore & Present.
- The duration data needs to be converted to an ISO format to be loaded into Adverity
  Data Storage.
- Adverity default target fields cannot be edited or deleted.
- Only users with the required permissions can edit target fields.
- Quickfilter widgets allow you to filter the data shown in some or all widgets on
  a specific dashboard page.
- The quickfilter widget is shown at the top of the dashboard page. Anyone with view
  access to the dashboard can interact with this widget to filter the data shown in
  the selected widgets.
- Only one permanent filter can be applied to each dashboard page.
- You can apply a maximum of two dimension filters to a dashboard.
- Ensure the datastream is properly configured.
- If the data source does not support the combination of fields you selected in the
  datastream configuration, change the list of selected fields.
- Ensure the authorization to the data source functions properly.
- If an authorization’s authorization to connect to the data source expires, update
  the authorization.
- If an account with which you authorized authorizations no longer has access to the
  data source, delete the affected authorizations.

- The data extract shows the data after transformations have been applied.
- To view the data in a raw state, disable any transformations applied to the datastream
  and run the fetch again.
- The Overwritten status may be more frequent if you use the Unique by day setting
  in Local Data Retention.
- 'Custom monitors cannot be created for the fields with the following data types:
  duration, formula, json.'
- Workspaces are created in a tree structure, where child workspaces may inherit settings
  and permissions from the parent workspace.
- Changes to the Data Mapping that change the table structure of the data extract
  may not match the structure of your data in Adverity Data Storage and any destinations.
- Changes made to the Data Mapping are not applied to data that has already been loaded
  into Adverity Data Storage or destinations. To update the data in Adverity Data
  Storage and any destinations with the new Data Mapping, re-load the data extracts.
- You need to create a datastream and fetch data before you can apply Data Mapping
  to the collected data extract.
- Adverity provides default target fields for frequently collected data, such as date.
- Target fields can be used by all users in all workspaces in your organization.
- Adverity uses ISO 8601 format for dates and datetimes for best parsing performance.
- Use convertDates custom script instruction to standardize date formats.
- Authorization can be either 'Token {{KEY}}' or 'Bearer {{KEY}}' depending on the

- Use OVER (PARTITION BY 0) to compute a function differently for all distinct combinations
  of dimension values.
- Use OVER (PARTITION BY 1) to compute a function differently for all distinct combinations
  of dimension values, excluding the last dimension.
- Use OVER (PARTITION BY {number-of-dimensions-to-exclude}) to compute a function
  differently for all distinct combinations of dimension values, excluding a number
  of dimensions at the end of the list.
- Use OVER() to compute a function for all rows without splitting data for any dimensions.
- Calculated KPIs can be loaded into Explore & Present but not external destinations.
- Do not retrieve Calculated KPIs from data sources - this can result in incorrect
  data. Instead, fetch the underlying metrics from your data source and use Adverity
  to compute the Calculated KPI you need.
- To avoid discrepancies in your data as a result of non-aggregatable metrics, visualize
  non-aggregatable metrics with the same level of granularity you used when you collected
  these metrics.
- Create a separate datastream for each level of granularity you want to use for non-aggregatable
  metrics.
- Mapping tables link source values to target values.
- Mapping tables can be automatically populated with values taken from a data extract.
