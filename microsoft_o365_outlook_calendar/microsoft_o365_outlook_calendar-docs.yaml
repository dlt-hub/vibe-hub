auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.onesight.solutions/kb/osseasyapi-user-guide/:
  - The API supports HTTP Basic Authentication (RFC 7617) via the Authorization header,
    where a username and password are encoded and sent as an HTTP authorization header
    entry. Alternatively, Bearer Token authentication can be used by setting the Authorization
    property to 'Bearer Token', which includes the bearer token in the authorization
    header. Additional custom HTTP headers can be specified separately via the Http
    Header section. No authorization information is required if the Authorisation
    property is set to 'None'.
- information_source; https://help.onesight.solutions/kb/outlook-calendar-api-access-guide/:
  - Authorization tokens are obtained through an OAuth2 flow where an authorization
    code is exchanged for an access token and refresh token. Access tokens expire
    after approximately 1 hour (specified by the 'expires_in' field) and must be refreshed
    using the refresh token. To request API data, include the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>" in HTTP GET requests to the Microsoft
    Graph API endpoint.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Register an application, manually
    generate an authorization code, exchange it for an access token and refresh token
    via token request, then use the access token in API data requests. Access tokens
    expire after approximately one hour; use the refresh token to obtain new access
    and refresh tokens. Refer to Microsoft's OAuth2 documentation for current implementation
    details.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Send a POST request with form-encoded
    body containing grant_type set to 'authorization_code', the authorization code,
    redirect_uri, client_id, and client_secret. The response returns access_token,
    refresh_token, and expires_in fields. The authorization code expires in approximately
    10 minutes and can only be used once, so tokens must be saved and access tokens
    refreshed before expiration using the expires_in value.
  - OAuth2 token refresh flow for Microsoft Graph API. POST to https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded and body parameters grant_type=refresh_token,
    refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret. Returns JSON response with new access
    token.
