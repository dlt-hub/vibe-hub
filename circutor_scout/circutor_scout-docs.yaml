auth_info:
- information_source; https://scout.circutor.com/docs/en/development/api_rest/:
  - App tokens are an alternative authentication method tied to an account for read/write
    operations. Tokens are created either from the website or via API and are used
    instead of username/password credentials to access Scout's data and perform operations
    on assets, devices, gateways, and metrics.
  - The API uses an app token for authentication. The token is obtained from a previous
    API call and returned in the "secret" field of the response body. This app token
    is then used to perform subsequent API requests to the endpoints documented in
    the Swagger page at https://scout.circutor.com/api/v2/docs/index.html. The documentation
    does not explicitly specify the header name or parameter name where this token
    should be sent in API requests.
  - The API uses an app token passed as the X-API-KEY header for authentication. Include
    the X-API-KEY header with your token value in all requests to the endpoints.
