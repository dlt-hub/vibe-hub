notes:
- The API is in the process of integrating business-to-business access and does not
  have a mechanism for individuals yet.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- System voltage:12V/24V/36V/48V.
- 'Max.PV input voltage: 145V.'
- 'Min.PV input voltage: 12V.'
- Max.PV input power:300W/12V, 600W/24V, 900W/36V, 1200W/48V.
- BougeRV promises an 18-month warranty for the 20 amp buck-boost MPPT solar charge
  controller.
- The usual Thickness used for Separators is 0.5mm, thicker is not required.
- The solar system is a success, 13.1 volts on the charge controller for the batteries,
  runs a sump pump in the basement and much more.
- Local pickup available in Houston, but we also ship.
- No specific authentication requirements stated
- ECO-WORTHY offers a complete and cost-effective range of solar products.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The poster in the resources section may or may not apply to you in full or in part.
  That is a question for your local jurisdiction.
- Every area has their own set of rules and their own interpretation of those rules.
- The XW Pro should power loads right out of the box with a battery connected.
- Calibration of AC Output voltage, Battery High and Low Cutout may be needed with
  multiple units.
- Suitable for both asynchronous and synchronous AC motors
- Order from stock available in webshop
- Testing is being conducted in a climate-controlled environment.
- No authentication required to access threads and members data.
- Some modules have markings that say the problem (broken studs, for example) but
  most just say 'BAD' and likely have a dead cell.
- NMC and pouch cells is possibly the worst combination possible for home ESS.
- Project involves DIY solar power setups and experimentation with battery technologies.
- CIG is expensive compared to monocrystalline or flexible panels.
- CIG requires more area/kW as they're less efficient and have a higher degradation
  rate.
- CIGs panels may help with shading from shrouds and masts.
- Some suppliers have high charges for overseas shipping.
- API does not require authentication.
- Ensure correct endpoint paths are used.
- Requires specific configuration for Deye inverters.
- If the supply (PV array) is connected to the below terminals, + should be on the
  left side, - on the right and the same for the load (Solar inverter) on the top
  side.
- No authentication required for access to public threads and members.
- Display may malfunction when using non-original batteries.
- AGM battery replacement may affect internal charger performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in midnite kid
- Ensure correct USB cable is used (USB-A to Mini-B with FTDI FT232 chipset).
- Software may require running as admin or switching USB ports.
- Check for driver updates and correct device recognition in Device Manager.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup for API access
- Requires setup of connected app in Home Assistant for OAuth2.
- Communications use two protocols, one based on Pylontech.
- Manufacturer does not disclose BMS brand/model.
- Use at your own risk. Our forum assumes no responsibility for products purchased
  in this area. This section is for individuals only! No vendors allowed!
- Solid value for around $330
- Decent overload/motor start capability but keep things at 1000W or so sustained
- All Noctua fans can also be used when only + and GND are connected. The fan will
  then run at full speed.
- The inverter will kick up a fan lock warning in cool weather/low load scenarios.
  Just ignore it.
- You'll need to wire up jst connections.
- 'The inverter uses a JST XH 2.54mm connector for the fans with the following pinout:
  Pin 1 - Control (Blue), Pin 2 - +12v DC (Red), Pin 3 - Sense (Yellow), Pin 4 - GND
  (Black).'
- Outside US - 'Server Not Found' unless using VPN
- Use the swagger command to get a list of many commands and their parameters.
- May have to repeat the GET command a few times as the gateway tries to find the
  candidate inverter via PLC.
- 'Important: You must enter your inverter''s serial number in the two SERIAL parameters.'
- 'The ''result: succeed'' only means the API command was acknowledged. But it doesn''t
  mean it actually deleted the device.'
- This feature may not be available in some browsers.
- We are in the process of integrating business-to-business at this point for our
  API, and don’t have a mechanism for individuals to access their systems with it
  just yet.
- API is in the process of integrating business-to-business access.
- Check for updates on the API in the future.
- Install the Mosquitto broker addon v6.5.0 with the default config
- Install the lxp-bridge addon v0.13.0
- Pay attention to the mqtt host setting, it should go to the external interface of
  HA, not localhost
- Can dump data into Home Assistant via MQTT.
- Connects to the EG4 wifi module over your LAN and works concurrently with monitor.eg4electronics.com.
- Some solutions allow you to still use monitor.eg4electronics.com while collecting
  data.
- Ensure MQTT integration is configured properly.
- Use external interface of HA for MQTT host settings.
- Can dump data into Home Assistant via MQTT and directly into InfluxDB.
- lxp-bridge does not appear to function if you block the dongle from reaching the
  internet.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for data access.
- To increase data return rate, run `mosquitto_pub -h homeassistant.local -t lxp/cmd/all/set/param/0
  -m 20 -u mqtt -P somepassword`.
- There is no known turnkey solution for data collection from EG4 inverters.
- Multiple projects may need to be cobbled together for effective data collection.
- Make sure that when you go to Settings->Devices (default Integrations tab) that
  you see MQTT listed under Configured which should show at least one device (your
  inverter).
- If it's under Discovered then you might have to click the Add button.
- The documentation, however, basically is the Swagger UI linked above.
- The API is in the process of integrating business-to-business access.
- Ensure the MQTT integration is added in Home Assistant settings.
- Uses various integrations to collect data from EG4 inverters
- Some solutions may not support all models, check specific compatibility
- Integrating business-to-business at this point for API access.
- Currently no mechanism for individuals to access their systems via the API.
- The API is a cloud API, not direct to the inverter
- Requires setup of API key for access
