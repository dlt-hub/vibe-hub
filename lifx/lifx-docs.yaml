auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.developer.lifx.com/reference/authentication:
  - 'All requests require an OAuth 2 access token generated in account settings. Authenticate
    using the HTTP Authorization header with format "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
    where {token} is your access token, or use HTTP Basic Authentication with the
    access token as username and blank password. All requests must use HTTPS; HTTP
    requests are rejected with 426 status.'
  - The API supports two authentication methods. Bearer token authentication sends
    the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}". HTTP Basic Authentication
    sends the token as the username with an empty password, formatted as "{token}:".
- information_source; https://api.developer.lifx.com/reference/how-to-use-the-following-examples:
  - LIFX API uses bearer token authentication. Generate an API key from the LIFX Cloud
    settings page and include it in the Authorization header as a bearer token when
    making requests to the API endpoints.

    Include the header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with each request
    to authenticate. The token should be provided as credentials in your API client
    configuration.'
