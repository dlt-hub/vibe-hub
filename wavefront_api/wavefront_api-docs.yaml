auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.wavefront.com/using_wavefront_api.html:
  - API authentication requires a token that can be associated with either a user
    account or service account. Tokens must be used to authenticate REST API calls
    made outside the in-product API documentation UI.
  - 'API token-based authentication is required for REST API calls outside the UI.
    Use the Authorization header with a Bearer token associated with either a user
    account or service account.


    To authenticate, include the header: -H ''Authorization: Bearer <your_api_token>''
    where your_api_token is obtained from the API Access tab in your user account
    settings or from a service account. The token must be passed in the Authorization
    header with the Bearer scheme for all API requests to endpoints like https://<your_instance>/api/v2/cloudintegration.'
