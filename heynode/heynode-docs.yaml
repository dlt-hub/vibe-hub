notes:
- request-promise is a Promise-based wrapper for the request library
- request has entered maintenance mode and will not add new features
- Node.js is a top tool for processing large amounts of data.
- Data brokering helps connect applications without tightly coupling them.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The only true requirement is that the file is valid JSON.
- Most package.json fields are optional, but they can be very useful to other tools.
- A lockfile is a snapshot of the entire dependency tree, including all packages and
  all their dependencies, and all their resolved version numbers.
- Committing your package-lock file to version control will help ensure that whoever
  runs your project will end up with the same dependency tree that you had when developing
  it.
- Global packages are tools we can run from the command line, and aren’t used as dependencies
  directly in an application.
- Using npm version 5 or above, uninstalling will automatically update your package.json.
- Run npm prune to clean up the node_modules folder.
- NPM uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for package version management.
- The package-lock.json file prevents version drift.
- Make sure to commit the changes made to both package.json and package-lock.json
  files.
- ETL processes can be computationally intensive and typically executed on a regular
  schedule.
- The result of an ETL process lags the actual state of your source data.
- Promises make writing asynchronous code easier.
- They are an improvement on the callback pattern and very popular in Node.js.
- Promise.all allows concurrent execution of multiple asynchronous operations.
- async/await is a relatively new feature, and is available in Node.js v7.6 and up.
- Transforming data involves renaming keys, removing unnecessary fields, and computing
  new values.
- The fs core module is available in every Node.js project without having to install
  it.
- Promise-based versions of the fs module methods were added in version 10 of Node.js.
- fs module is used to interact with the filesystem
- JSON.parse is used to convert JSON string to object
- JSON.stringify is used to convert object to JSON string
- Bulk loading data can be the simplest and most efficient option.
- Sometimes you are forced to load records one at a time.
- Streams are a built-in Node.js language feature that represent an asynchronous flow
  of data.
- Streams let us work with data that is too large to fit into memory.
- Using pipeline simplifies error handling and stream cleanup
- Transform streams can alter data as it is streamed
- Uses csvtojson to convert CSV data to JSON format.
- Output is stored in ndjson format for memory efficiency.
- Uses Express.js to stream files directly to HTTP responses.
- At a minimum we recommend installing the current Long Term Support (LTS) version
  of Node.js.
- We do not recommend using nvm to install Node.js for production environments.
- Never commit sensitive information like passwords or API keys to version control.
- Never commit your .env file to version control.
- Use an .env.example file to document needed environment variables.
- An API proxy acts as an intermediary between a consumer and backend services.
- Using an API proxy decouples the frontend from implementation details of the backend.
- Express is a minimal and extensible framework that provides a set of common utilities
  for building servers and web applications.
- Middleware is code that executes during the lifecycle of the request/response cycle.
- 'Error handling middleware takes 4 arguments: the error, req, res, and next.'
- Uses request and request-promise for API interaction.
- Exoplanet API can be slow to respond.
- Compression reduces the size of responses that are sent back to clients, saving
  bandwidth both for the server and for the client.
- Caching allows you to reuse retrieved data to speed up serving requests to your
  API.
- Enables compression middleware for all responses
- Responses from the planets routes are cached for 5 minutes (300 seconds).
- Node.js processes are single threaded to avoid multithreading complexity.
- The Event Loop allows offloading I/O tasks to the C++ APIs.
- The delay passed into setTimeout() is a minimum delay and it may take more time
  before the callback is executed.
- Uses setInterval() to check for available seats every second
- timer.unref() can be used to keep the timer running but not active
- The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is that setImmediate()
  will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle.
- Proper validation and sanitization will keep your form user-friendly and secure.
- It will also help prevent your application from malfunctioning when trying to process
  safe but unexpected input.
- The application listens on port 3000.
- Use express-validator to validate and sanitize user input on login forms.
- Sessions are a straightforward method of storing user data.
- Session IDs should be random and secure to protect against security threats.
- Uses MongoDB — requires setup of database
- User data is stored in a collection named 'userData'
- Uses passport-local-mongoose for authentication
- Session expiration is set to 1 hour

  outside of the 2xx range'
