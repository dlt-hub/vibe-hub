notes:
- Leverage the Tanium APIs to develop management, security and risk solutions.
- Developing solutions is easy.
- Tanium Gateway is the preferred option for API integrations with Tanium.
- Use of the module REST APIs should be reserved for cases where the functionality
  is not yet available through Gateway.
- Use of REST API for integrations is being phased out in favor of GraphQL API Gateway.
- Some endpoint availability will be limited to either Cloud or On-Prem deployments.
