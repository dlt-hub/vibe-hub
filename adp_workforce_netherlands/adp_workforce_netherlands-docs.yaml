auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.adp.com/guides/api-guides/adp-workforce-now-api-catalog:
  - ADP Workforce Now APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Developers must establish
    a developer agreement with ADP and obtain credentials. Certificate-based authentication
    is required, as indicated by the prerequisite guide on generating a Certificate
    Signing Request. Exact header names, parameter names, and token acquisition details
    are not specified in this excerpt.

  : - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required for all endpoints. Client credentials (client
      id and client secret) must be provided to obtain an access token. The token
      should be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with each request.
    - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required for all listed endpoints. The token type
      is OAuth 2.0 and the required scope is specified as "Client id/client secret",
      indicating that client credentials grant type should be used with your client
      ID and client secret to obtain an access token. Include the access token in
      the Authorization header as a Bearer token for requests to these endpoints.
    - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required with client ID and client secret credentials.
      The API uses token-based authentication where you must obtain an OAuth 2.0 token
      and include it in requests to access the worker demographic data endpoints,
      with required scope(s) specified per operation.
    - Oauth 2.0 token type is required. Authentication uses client id and client secret
      credentials. The token should be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization
      header. Required scopes depend on the specific endpoint but are tied to client
      id/client secret authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.adp.com/guides/api-guides/worker-management-api-guide-for-adp-ihcm-2:
  - Pagination uses $Skip and $Top query parameters. $Skip specifies the number of
    records to skip (offset), and $Top specifies the maximum number of records to
    return per page. When pagination reaches the end, an empty body is returned (for
    example /hr/v2/workers?$Skip=201&$Top=100).
  - Pagination uses $top (number of items to include, query parameter) and $skip (number
    of items to skip, query parameter). Repeat requests incrementing $skip until an
    empty workers array is returned.
- information_source; https://developers.adp.com/guides/api-guides/worker-management-api-guide-for-decidium:
  - Pagination uses $top (query parameter specifying maximum items per page) and $skip
    (query parameter specifying items to skip). Request subsequent pages by incrementing
    $skip by the $top value until a 204 No Content HTTP response is received, indicating
    no more data.
  - The API endpoint returns a collection of workers and the consumer application
    repeats requests until a 204 No Content HTTP response status code is returned,
    indicating pagination completion. No explicit pagination parameters like page,
    limit, offset, or cursor are documented in this excerpt.
  - Use the `$skip` query parameter to paginate through worker collections. The consumer
    application repeatedly requests subsequent collections until receiving a 204 No
    Content HTTP response status code, indicating the end of pagination.
