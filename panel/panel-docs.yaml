notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Add guidance on troubleshooting OAuth issues
- Panel is an open-source Python library designed to streamline the development of
  robust tools, dashboards, and complex applications entirely within Python.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in panel
- To maintain backward compatibility Panel will still try to infer the appropriate
  sizing mode by inspecting the children of a container.
- Usage of `pn.config.raw_css` and `pn.config.css_files` is now strongly discouraged.
- Panel supports dynamically executing Python code as a user interacts with a panel.
- Panel can be exported to static HTML.
- The first time you run `pixi`, it will create a `.pixi` directory in the source
  directory.
- Currently, this needs to be run for each environment. So, if you want to install
  in the `test-ui` environment, you can add `--environment` / `-e` to the command.
- 'Important: Is Panel installed together with JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook in your
  working environment? If not, you need to make sure that panel is also installed
  in the same environment as JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook.'
- User authentication hooks NOT provided (default user enabled)
- The Jupyter Panel Preview feature described works exclusively within the JupyterLab
  interface.
- The `.param` table shows us the default parameter values of the `IntSlider` class.
- A Pane is a component that can display an object.
- Specific Panes allow you to display output with precision and efficiency.
- Uses alignment options to adjust content layout.
- pn.rx allows you to treat any object as a reactive expression.
- Throttling limits the rate of updates for smoother performance.
- No authentication required
- Notebook display of templates is not currently supported.
- You don’t need to be a frontend developer to style your Panel apps.
- Uses Panel for UI components and notifications.
- This documentation does not describe any API endpoints or resources.
- The data is only downloaded once, improving performance by caching the result.
- Uses Altair for data visualization and Panel for report generation.
- Uses CSV format for data extraction.
- Data needs to be preprocessed before visualization
- Caching is used to improve performance by storing data results.
- Uses HoloViews for interactive plots and Panel for dashboard creation.
- 'The code refers to wind_speed = pn.rx(8.0): This is a reactive expression with
  an initial value of 8.0. The UI updates whenever the value wind_speed.rx.value is
  changed.'
- 'pn.state.add_periodic_callback(update_wind_speed, period=1000): This updates the
  wind_speed_rx.value every 1000 milliseconds.'
- To make the Streaming Chat Bot scale to many users you should be using async.
- A todo app can be built in many other ways. The main purpose of this example is
  for all of us to acquire the basic skills needed to develop stateful, dynamically
  updating apps like this one.
- Is Panel installed together with JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook in your working environment?
  If not, you need to make sure that panel is also installed in the same environment
  as JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook.
- Recommended to use declarative programming for maintainability and efficiency
- Inefficient code can lead to unnecessary recalculations and decreased performance
- This guide builds upon the Develop in an Editor (beginner) tutorial.

- You can serve a notebook with `panel serve file.ipynb`, Panel will parse your notebook
  to collect all of its code and run it as if it were a Python script.
- Requires setup of connected app in panel
- 'Notifications are objects you don’t manipulate directly, you call pn.state.notifications
  with methods: success, info, warning, and error.'
- Components usually have a link to their documentation page in their docstring.
- The templates provided by Panel should not be rendered in a notebook, as their CSS
  styling usually doesn’t play well with the CSS styling of the notebook itself.
- ReactiveHTML empowers you to design and build custom components that seamlessly
  integrate with your Panel applications.
- The required attribute is _template which defines the blueprint for how your custom
  component should look and behave.
- By declaring an _extension_name the component should be loaded explicitly with pn.extension('material-components')
- In a notebook dependencies for this component will not be loaded unless the user
  explicitly loads them with a pn.extension('material-components')
- Panel widgets support easy embedding into static HTML pages for exporting notebooks.
- ipywidgets require a separate and cumbersome embed widget state operation to copy
  state from Python into the web page source.
- The audio player supports ogg, mp3, and wav file formats
- When using NumPy arrays or Torch Tensors, the sample_rate must be specified
- Panel, HoloViews, hvPlot and GeoViews are all members of the HoloViz ecosystem and
  you can expect them to work perfectly together.
- Enabling the ipywidgets extension in JupyterLab may interfere with the UI.
- The JPG pane embeds a .jpg or .jpeg image file in a panel if provided a local path,
  or it will link to a remote image if provided a URL.

  LaTeX renderer.
- Markdown pane allows rendering arbitrary Markdown in a panel.
- Supports basic and extended Markdown syntax.
- The Matplotlib pane allows displaying Matplotlib figures inside a Panel app.
- The pane will only watch the Stream if it is displayed. Set always_watch=True to
  watch immediately.
- 'Synchronization is done in only one direction: Python => JavaScript. Modifications
  done on the JavaScript side are not reflected back to the Python vtkRenderWindow.'
- Utilization of the orientation widget
- Creating an animation with player widget
- Python acts as a server, sending information about the scene to the client.
- 'Synchronization is done in only one direction: Python => JavaScript.'
- The scene can be exported and the file generated can be loaded by the official vtk-js
  scene importer.
- Uses VTK pane to render vtk.js files.
- The camera parameter is updated only at the end of the interaction.
- The Vega pane renders Vega-based plots (including those from Altair) inside a panel.
- It optimizes plot rendering by using binary serialization for any array data found
  in the Vega/Altair object.
- Defines a max_array_size to avoid issues with large arrays.
- The AutocompleteInput widget allows selecting a value from a list or dictionary
  of options by entering the value into an auto-completing text field.
- The ButtonIcon widget allows triggering events when the button is clicked.
- The toggle_duration determines how long the active_icon should be shown for and
  how long the button should be disabled for.
- Only a small subset of Ace functionality is currently enabled
- Default language is 'text'
- If filename is provided the file extension will be used to determine the language
- The DataFrame widget allows displaying and editing a pandas DataFrame.
- Editing is not possible for multi-indexed DataFrames.
- The DataFrame widget will eventually be replaced with the Tabulator widget.
- The datetime parser uses the defined format to validate the input value.
- Uses a browser-dependent calendar widget to select the datetime
- The `DatetimeSlider` widget allows selecting a datetime value within a set bounds
  using a slider.
- The FileDropper allows for chunked uploads, making it possible to upload large files.
- Uploaded files are stored as dictionary of bytes object indexed by the filename.
- The FileInput widget allows uploading one or more files from the frontend and makes
  the filename, file data and MIME type available in Python.
- The widget also has a save method that allows saving the uploaded data to a file
  or BytesIO object.
- While the FileInput widget doesn’t set any limit on the size of a file that can
  be selected by a user, the infrastructure onto which Panel relies limits significantly
  what is actually possible.
- The directory to browse cannot access files above this directory.
- Not all keys of the value need to be specified, and the keys can be specified in
  any order.
- The functionality is experimental and only supported by Chrome and a few other browsers.
- Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won’t work
  offline.
- Styling with gradients requires Matplotlib to be installed.
- 'Terminal apps that just work: Xterm.js works with most terminal apps such as bash,
  vim and tmux, this includes support for curses-based apps and mouse event support.'
- 'Performance: Xterm.js is really fast, it even includes a GPU-accelerated renderer.'
- 'Rich unicode support: Supports CJK, emojis and IMEs.'

- The `TimePicker` widget allows entering a time value as text or `datetime.time`.
- Either `datetime.time` or `str` can be used as input and `TimePicker` can be bounded
  by a start and end time.
- The ToggleIcon widget allows toggling a single condition between True/False states.
- This widget is interchangeable with the Checkbox and Toggle widget.
- In general it is preferred to modify layouts only through the provided methods and
  avoid modifying the objects parameter directly.
- Feed is a Column-like layout that displays a Feed of objects.
- It is useful for displaying long outputs with many rows because of its ability to
  limit the number of entries loaded at once.
- A FlexBox layout can either be instantiated as empty and populated after the fact
  or using a list of objects provided as positional arguments.
- The Swipe layout accepts any two objects, which must have identical sizing options
  to work as intended.
- Tabs allow switching between multiple objects by clicking on the corresponding tab
  header.
- The `Tabs` objects should never be modified directly.
- The list of objects to display in the WidgetBox should not generally be modified
  directly except when replaced in its entirety.
- Defaults to auto_grow=True and max_rows=10
- The value is not synced to the server until the message is actually sent
- ChatInterface can be initialized without any arguments but becomes more useful with
  a callback.
- By default notifications last for the specified duration specified in milliseconds
  and defaulting to 3 seconds.
- Setting a duration of zero will cause the notification to stay in place until it
  is either manually dismissed in the UI or destroyed programmatically.
- The simplest form of a Gauge just requires setting a value which must be within
  the bounds.
- The Number is a value indicator providing a visual representation of a value, which
  may be colored according to provided thresholds.
- The Trend indicator provides a visual representation of a value along with an indicator
  of its recent trend.
- It supports streaming data to the plot component making it possible to provide performant
  live updates.
- Uses Bootstrap v4 for layout and styling.
- The EditableTemplate builds on the VanillaTemplate extending it with functionality
  for editing the layout of the components on the page.
- Built using the Fast.design framework.
- Uses Fast design library and applies the panel.theme.Fast design system by default.
- Built-in templates don’t render necessarily well in a notebook as their styling
  can badly interact with the notebook built-in styling.
- For development purposes, the app can be quickly rendered in another tab by replacing
  .servable() with .show().
- Uses Fast design library — requires setup of connected app in api
- To set a specific max-height in non full screen mode, you can use raw_css on the
  template.
- Uses Golden Layout CSS for creating movable tabs.
- Uses react-grid-layout for responsive, resizable, draggable grid layout.
- By default the SlidesTemplate will not render a header and instead render the title
  and logo at the bottom of the template.
- If you do want a header you can enable it with show_header=True.
- Unlike other templates, if added, the sidebar is hidden by default.
- Supports custom components using AnyWidget API on JavaScript side and param parameters
  API on Python side.
- JSComponent was introduced in June 2024 as a successor to ReactiveHTML.
- Ensure you have `panel >= 1.4.0` and `pyviz_comms >= 3.0.2` installed.
- If you are running JupyterLab in a separate environment from your notebook kernel,
  ensure these packages are installed in both.
- In Colab rendering for each notebook cell is isolated, which means that every cell
  must reload the Panel extension code separately. This will result in somewhat slower
  and larger notebook than with other notebook technologies.
- The IpyWidgets pane does not work in Google Colab. Thus you cannot use IpyWidgets
  with Panel in Colab.
- The support for Jupyter and Panel widgets in the interactive environment is fragile
  and you might experience issues.
- To enable you to run and debug Panel apps in PyCharm, create a configuration named
  'panel serve' with Module Name 'panel' and Parameters 'serve $FilePath$'.
- The theme can also be overridden with by setting theme as a URL query parameter
  for your application
- styles and stylesheets are new in Panel 1.0.0
- Background and surface colors generally are only set at the template level.
- Setting the loading icon may not appear to function properly on this page due to
  incompatibility with the tooling specific to the documentation.
- The line `alt.theme.enable(theme)` will set the theme of all future generated plots
  unless specifically changed.
- Nearly 30 builtin styles to Matplotlib that can be activated with plt.style.use
- Uses dark theme with custom accent color
- pn.bind works very similarly to Python’s functools.partial, except that it automatically
  resolves the current value of any widgets

  stage controlled either manually or from within the stage, without having to define
  complex callbacks or other GUI logic.
- Enable profiling and debugging
- Set up testing for an application
- Uses pn.state.onload to defer long running tasks after app load
- on_session_destroyed callbacks can be registered globally or from within a session
- on_session_created callbacks can only be created globally
- The dynamic callbacks may not function properly in the online documentation. Please
  use them in a notebook or script.
- When starting a server dynamically with pn.serve you cannot start a periodic callback
  before the application is actually being served.
- Scheduled task must not be declared in the application code itself
- Scheduling using pn.state.schedule_task is idempotent
- By default the starting time is immediate but may be overridden with the at keyword
  argument
- The period may be declared using the period argument or a cron expression
- Bokeh server is designed to be thread safe which requires a set of locks.
- The notification system is enabled by default.
- Disconnect and ready notifications can be configured.
- In a notebook environment pn.state.location is not initialized until the first plot
  has been displayed
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- If a pixi command fails to lock or install an environment, you can try to limit
  the number of concurrent solves and/or concurrent downloads.
