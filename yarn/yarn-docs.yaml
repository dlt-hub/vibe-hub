auth_info:
- information_source; https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/axios:
  - Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header. Set the AUTH_TOKEN value
    in the Authorization header (e.g., `instance.defaults.headers.common['Authorization']
    = AUTH_TOKEN;`) for requests to be authenticated.
  - HTTP Basic authentication is supported via the auth object with username and password
    properties, which automatically sets the Authorization header. For Bearer tokens
    and other auth schemes, use custom Authorization headers instead.
  - axios supports setting a default Authorization header globally via `axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization']`
    with an AUTH_TOKEN value, which will be sent with all requests. Alternatively,
    custom instance defaults can be configured per domain to avoid sending credentials
    to unintended hosts.
- information_source; https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@octokit/core:
  - Authentication is optional for public REST API endpoints but required for GraphQL
    queries. Pass a token via the `auth` option in the Octokit constructor (personal
    access token, OAuth token, installation access token, or JWT for GitHub App).
    The `Authorization` header is automatically set based on token type. Alternatively,
    use a custom authentication strategy by setting `options.authStrategy`.
  - Authentication is passed to the Octokit constructor via the `auth` option. For
    REST API requests, provide a personal access token created at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo.
    For GraphQL requests, pass the token as the `auth` parameter. The default authentication
    strategy is `@octokit/auth-token`. Tokens are sent as bearer credentials in request
    headers by the underlying request library.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest:
  - The `per_page` query parameter defaults to 30 and accepts up to 100 to retrieve
    large datasets efficiently. An optional `mapFunction` can transform each page
    response and accepts a `done` callback to terminate pagination early.
  - Use per_page query parameter (optional, defaults to 30, max 100) to control page
    size. Pagination is indicated by a Link header in responses from "List ..." endpoints;
    use octokit.paginate() to automatically handle pagination across all pages.
