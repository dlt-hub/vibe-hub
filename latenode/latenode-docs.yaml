- ? information_source; https://community.latenode.com/t/why-do-i-encounter-a-rate-limit-error-when-i-have-remaining-api-calls-on-github/25029
  : - 'Authenticated requests to the GitHub REST API receive a higher rate limit than
      unauthenticated requests. Authentication is performed by including an Authorization
      header with a personal access token or other credential.


      Include the header Authorization: token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in your requests,
      where YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN is a GitHub personal access token generated
      from your account settings. Alternatively, you can use basic authentication
      with Authorization: Basic followed by base64-encoded username:password, or use
      OAuth tokens. The exact token format and scopes depend on your GitHub account
      permissions and the API endpoints you are accessing.'
- information_source; https://latenode.com/blog/checklist-for-self-hosting-low-code-platforms:
  - Secure authentication methods for API endpoints include OAuth 2.0, API keys, and
    JWT. Webhook triggers should support automatic retries and configurable timeouts.
    Latenode provides built-in database pooling and robust webhook capabilities for
    reliable connectivity.

  - Reddit API uses OAuth2 with password grant type for authentication. Exchange client
    credentials and user credentials via POST to https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token
    using HTTP Basic Auth with client_id and client_secret, request body containing
    grant_type set to "password", username, and password, plus a User-Agent header.
    The response returns an access_token field used for subsequent authenticated requests.
  - 'The provided text contains authentication information. Here is the extraction:


    Bearer token authentication is required. Include an Authorization header with
    the value Bearer {access_token}, where {access_token} is your authentication token.
    The token should be passed in the headers dictionary of your HTTP request to the
    API endpoint.'

  : - 'Authentication uses a personal access token sent in the Authorization header.
      Include the header "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" where YOUR_TOKEN is your
      actual personal access token from GitHub. This token must be included in all
      requests to create issues or add comments.'

- ? information_source; https://latenode.com/blog/integration-api-management/api-integration-best-practices/what-is-github-api-and-how-to-get-a-github-api-key-tutorial-and-examples
  : - GitHub APIs use page and per_page query parameters for pagination. The page
      parameter specifies the desired page number, and per_page controls the number
      of items per page. The API returns pagination metadata including total items,
      current page, and links to navigate to next or previous pages via response headers.
    - Use the page parameter to specify the page number and per_page parameter to
      control items per page. Navigate using Link header pagination links with rel="next"
      to retrieve subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://latenode.com/blog/what-is-jira-rest-api-how-to-leverage-the-rest-api-and-secure-jira-api-key:
  - Requests with potentially large result sets use offset-based pagination via startAt
    (0-based index) and maxResults (max results per page, default 50, customizable
    up to 100) query parameters. The API returns links to next and previous pages;
    construct subsequent requests by incrementing startAt by maxResults value.
