pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.onupkeep.com:
  - 'Offset-based pagination using limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls how many root recurring work orders are fetched (note: actual results
    may exceed the limit due to child work order expansion). Use offset to paginate
    through results, incrementing it by the limit value for subsequent requests.'
  - Offset-limit pagination is used. The offset query parameter specifies the starting
    position, and the limit query parameter specifies the maximum number of results
    to return per request. The orderBy parameter controls sort order with a default
    of createdAt DESC.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    where to start in the result set, and limit controls how many results to return
    per request. Both parameters are optional with undefined defaults. The orderBy
    parameter defaults to createdAt DESC for sorting paginated results.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The sort parameter controls
    ordering (default createdAt DESC). Use offset to specify the starting position
    and limit to specify the number of results per request.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (default undefined) and limit specifies the number of results per request
    (default undefined). No response fields indicating pagination state or next page
    information are documented.
