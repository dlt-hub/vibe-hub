auth_info:
- information_source; https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference:
  - 'API authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The
    token should be prefixed with "Bearer " followed by your API key (format: sk-MYAPIKEY).
    Send this in the "authorization" header of your POST request.'
  - API key authentication is required and must be provided; a 401 status indicates
    missing or invalid API key. The documentation does not explicitly specify the
    header name or parameter location for submitting the API key.
  - 'API key authentication is required via the Authorization header using Bearer
    token format. Send the API key as Authorization: Bearer sk-YOUR_API_KEY in the
    request headers. The accept header should be set to image/* to specify the response
    format.'
  - API key authentication is required via the `authorization` header. Pass your Stability
    API key (obtained from https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys) as the value
    of the `authorization` header in each request. The `content-type` header must
    be set to `multipart/form-data`, and the `accept` header should be either `image/*`
    or `application/json` depending on desired response format.
  - API key authentication is required via the `authorization` header. The header
    must contain your Stability API key (STABILITY_API_KEY). Optionally, you can include
    `stability-client-id` and `stability-client-user-id` headers to identify your
    application and user.
