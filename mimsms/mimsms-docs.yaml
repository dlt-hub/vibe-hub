  - MiMSMS API uses credentials passed in the JSON request body for authentication.
    You must include UserName (your registered email address) and Apikey (generated
    from your MiMSMS Developer Portal) in every SMS sending request. The API key is
    obtained by signing up for a MiMSMS account and generating it from the Developer
    Options section of the MiMSMS Portal.
  - 'The API requires two query parameters for authentication: UserName (email address)
    and Apikey (API key string). Both must be passed as query string parameters in
    the URL for GET or POST requests to the SmsSending endpoints.'
