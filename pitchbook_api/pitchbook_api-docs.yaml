auth_info:
- information_source; https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1797923/2s83mbojGM:
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. After login, the response includes an
    access_token field with token_type "Bearer" that should be sent in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}". The token expires after expires_in seconds
    (1800 in the example). A refresh_token may be provided for obtaining new access
    tokens.
  - The API uses username and password credentials sent as JSON in the request body
    to a login endpoint at POST {{URL}}/ECM/api/login. The response returns a Bearer
    token in the access_token field with token_type "Bearer" and an expires_in value
    of 1800 seconds, along with a refresh_token for token refresh. Subsequent authenticated
    requests should use the Bearer token in the Authorization header.
  - The SSM API uses Bearer token authentication. Send a POST request to {{url}}/ECM/api/login
    with username and password in JSON body to obtain a token. Include the returned
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" for all subsequent API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7679680/SVYrrxuU:
  - 'Pagination uses page[size] and page[number] as query parameters. page[size] specifies
    the number of results per page, and page[number] specifies which page to retrieve
    (example: page[size]=1&page[number]=1).'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page[size] and page[number], both optional and
    specified in the query string. page[size] controls results per page and page[number]
    specifies which page to retrieve, as shown in example URLs with page[size]=1&page[number]=1.
  - The API uses query parameters `page[number]` (page index, starting at 1) and `page[size]`
    (results per page) for pagination. The response includes a `pagination` object
    with the total number of hits, and a `next` link to retrieve the next page. Increment
    `page[number]` or use the `next` link to paginate through results.
  - Use the query parameters page[number] (required, starting at 1) and page[size]
    (required, controls results per page) to paginate lei-records endpoint results.
    The response includes pagination metadata to construct subsequent requests.
  - Where a response contains more than 15 results, pagination information and first/last
    page links are included in the response. The documentation indicates pagination
    is based on the JSON API specification but does not specify the exact request
    parameters, response field names, or navigation mechanics beyond mentioning first/last
    page links.
