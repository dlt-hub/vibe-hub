notes:
- Webhooks are secured using a shared secret that is used to generate a signature.
- Aurinko enables product teams to quickly build and manage mailbox data sync solutions
  and integrations through a secure and reliable API platform.
- This token should only be used for development purposes.
- You must be signed in as a super administrator of your Google Workspace to complete
  the actions listed below.
- You need to have OAuth clientId and clientSecret from Google, Microsoft, Zoho to
  be able to use Aurinko's OAuth Flow in production.
- 'The Aurinko portal offers four distinct roles for team members: Collaborator, Developer,
  Administrator, Owner.'
- Aurinko Email API abstracts differences between popular email APIs (Gmail, Office
  365, etc.)
- Supports incremental synchronization of email messages
- Using Pub/Sub eliminates the need for constant polling of your Gmail inbox for updates,
  improving efficiency.
- User OAuth Flow enables user-delegated authorization.
- Authorization request requires specific query parameters.
- The default Aurinko's Redirect URI https://api.aurinko.io/v1/auth/callback may not
  work for you in production.
- Aurinko's authentication scopes enhance security by allowing granular permission
  control.
- Office 365 / Azure AD users could simply use https://api.aurinko.io/v1/auth/callback
  for callback URLs.
- 'To ensure your Zoho integration works globally, enable the checkbox: ''Use the
  same OAuth credentials for all data centers''.'
- Service accounts enable server-to-server access to web resources without user involvement.
- Aurinko supports G Suite, MS Exchange, and Office 365.
- G Suite Domain-wide Delegation must be enabled for the service account.
- Set up an Office 365 daemon app registration to enable global admin authorizations
- Streamline scheduling with Aurinko's integrated calendar booking page, designed
  for seamless client interactions and effortless appointment management.
- This endpoint requires app-level authentication (ClientId+Secret)
- Supports offline mailbox access and ability to access Graph API.
- Requires user to authenticate with Aurinko.
- All Teams users in Aurinko are associated with their Office 365 organizations automatically.
- MS Bot Framework has limitations, bots don't get notified on channel events and
  receive only the messages explicitly addressing the bots.
- Uses OAuth2 for user authentication and authorization
- Supports Google service accounts for OAuth flow
- API endpoints are dynamically generated based on your configuration.
- Incremental synchronization of email messages is supported.
