  - name: "accounts"
    endpoint: "/api/accounts"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Example query parameters (if any)
      # - limit: Max number of accounts to retrieve
      # - offset: Offset for pagination
    data_selector: "$.data.accounts"  # Adjust as necessary based on actual response structure

### Notes:
- Replace placeholders like `your_username` and `your_password` with actual data when implementing.

- The `data_selector` paths may need to be modified according to the actual JSON response structure from the Gorgias API.
