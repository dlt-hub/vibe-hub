auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.whitelabel-loyalty.com:
  - 'Authentication is performed using Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header Authorization: Bearer your-token with each API request to the
    endpoints.'
- information_source; https://docs.whitelabel-loyalty.com/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer your-token" for all API requests.
- information_source; https://docs.whitelabel-loyalty.com/marketing.html:
  - API requests require an API Key passed as the X-Api-Key header. Include this header
    in all requests to authenticate with the WLL marketing API.
  - 'API requests require two authentication headers: X-Api-Key with your API key
    value and Authorization with a Bearer token (access_token). Both must be included
    in the request headers.'
  - Authentication requires an API key passed in the X-Api-Key header. Include the
    header X-Api-Key with your API key value in each request to the webhook endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.whitelabel-loyalty.com/marketing.html:
  - The GET /campaigns endpoint uses query parameters limit (default 10) and skip
    (for offset-based pagination). The response is a flat array without explicit pagination
    metadata, so pagination is controlled by adjusting limit and skip values in subsequent
    requests until fewer results than the limit are returned.
- information_source; https://docs.whitelabel-loyalty.com/rewards.html:
  - 'Pagination for the Badges Collection endpoint uses query parameters: skip (offset,
    default 0) and limit (page size, default 10) to control which results are returned.
    The endpoint supports sorting via sort and order parameters, but no response fields
    indicating total count, next page, or has_more status are documented.'
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, default 10, max 1000) and skip (optional, default
    0) query parameters to control page size and offset. The response structure for
    pagination fields is not shown in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, defaults to 10, maximum 1000) and skip (optional,
    defaults to 0) as query parameters to control page size and offset. The sort parameter
    specifies the sort field (id, createdAt, updatedAt, name, priority) and order
    parameter specifies sort direction (ASC or DESC).
  - 'Pagination uses limit and skip query parameters. limit specifies the number of
    results per request (example: 10), and skip specifies the offset for starting
    results (example: 0). The response contains a data array with user objects but
    does not indicate total count or next page information, so the client must track
    pagination state manually using these parameters.'
