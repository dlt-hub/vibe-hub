notes:
- The Sandbox environment is available for testing, but the API is not yet in production.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Patient API
- Some resources may have nested structures that need special handling
- This API is not live
- The Provider Directory API facilitates searches for Cigna Medicare Advantage and
  US Commercial in-network providers.
