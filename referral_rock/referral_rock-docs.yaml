- information_source; https://api.referralrock.com:
  - Referral Rock API uses Basic Authentication with public and private API keys.
    Include an Authorization header with each request using your public API key as
    username and private API key as password (base64-encoded). Private API keys are
    displayed only once upon generation and cannot be viewed later. Generate and manage
    keys at https://app.referralrock.com/clientadmin/integrations/apikeys.
  - 'Referral Rock uses HTTP Basic Authentication with API key credentials. Send a
    Base64-encoded string of apiPublicKey:apiPrivateKey in the Authorization header
    with the "Basic" scheme. For example, if your public key is "abc123" and private
    key is "xyz456", Base64 encode "abc123:xyz456" to get "YWJjMTIzOnp5eDQ1Ng==" and
    send it as Authorization: Basic YWJjMTIzOnp5eDQ1Ng==. API keys can be generated
    from the API page at https://app.referralrock.com/clientadmin/integrations/apikeys.'
