- All data is compressed using gzip compression to shrink the overall payload size.
- If you use expand in the request, the records per request limit reduces to 1000
  at most per request.
- Each record has a field called MlgCanView which indicates whether the record should
  be kept in your database.
- After 7 days records marked MlgCanView false will be removed from the data feed
  entirely.
- Please do not pull from this resource more frequently than once a day.
- Non-Alphanumeric characters can create issues with oData and the RESO Web API. For
  this purpose special characters must be stripped from the values provided in key
  fields.
