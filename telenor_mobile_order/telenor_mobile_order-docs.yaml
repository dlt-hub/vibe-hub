auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.telenor.no/api/communication/mobiltbedriftsnett/:
  - OAuth2 is required for authentication. Clients must authenticate as either a company
    machine user (API User) or end user. After authentication, clients must request
    user information from the catalog/userInfo endpoint, obtain a token from the status/token
    endpoint, and then authenticate to the CSTA Interface at /csta/authentication/token
    to access enterprise monitoring capabilities. Refer to https://developer.telenor.no/oauth/
    for OAuth implementation details.
- information_source; https://developer.telenor.no/minbedrift-sdk/guides/mobile-order/:
  - 'Credentials are passed to the CustomMobileOrderSubscription.GetInstance() method
    using four parameters: clientId, clientSecret, username, and password. These appear
    to be stored in string variables and used to initialize the subscription client,
    which then authenticates subsequent API calls. The exact mechanism for how these
    credentials are transmitted in requests (headers, body, query parameters) is not
    specified in the provided documentation excerpt.'
  - 'The API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow with username and password. Authentication
    requires four credentials: clientId, clientSecret, username, and password, which
    are passed to the CustomMobileOrderSubscription initialization method to obtain
    authorization for subsequent API calls.'
  - The authentication uses OAuth2 Resource Owner Password Credentials flow. Initialize
    the MobileOrderSdk with SetApiClientAndResourceOwnerCredentials method passing
    clientId, clientSecret, username, and password as parameters. These credentials
    are used internally by the SDK to obtain and manage access tokens for API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.telenor.no/minbedrift-sdk/guides/mobile-order/:
  - Use 'pageSize' and 'page' query parameters to paginate organizations. Responses
    include HTTP headers 'X-total-count' (total organizations found) and 'X-count'
    (organizations returned in current response).
  - Use the 'pageSize' and 'page' query parameters to control pagination. Responses
    include HTTP headers 'X-total-count' for total organizations found and 'X-count'
    for organizations returned in the current response.
