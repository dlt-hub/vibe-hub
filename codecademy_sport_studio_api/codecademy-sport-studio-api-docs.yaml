notes:
- The API is documented with Swagger and deployed on Railway.app.
- 'Each exercise on Codecademy has a dedicated page for Q&A, all contained within
  our #faq category.'
- Over time, as questions get asked and answered, volunteer super user community members
  will take everyone's replies to that thread and split them off into their own page
  in the 'Get Help' category.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This challenge project was added to the syllabus only a few days ago.
- This experiment shows that using the NKTg interpolation formula, we can recover
  the planetary masses given NASA’s real-time orbital data.
- It demonstrates a consistent relationship between orbital distance, velocity, and
  mass — supporting the proposed NKTg Law of variable inertia.
- Password authentication switched from MD5 to SCRAM-SHA-256.
- local replication all trust
- host replication all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
- host replication all ::1/128 trust
- Community discussions may vary in quality and relevance.
