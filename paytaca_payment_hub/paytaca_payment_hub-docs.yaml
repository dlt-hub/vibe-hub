  - Payment Hub uses HMAC-SHA256 signatures to verify webhook authenticity. When creating
    a store, you provide a webhook_secret_key that is used to generate HMAC-SHA256
    signatures for all webhook POST requests sent to your webhook_url. To verify incoming
    webhooks, compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request body using the webhook_secret_key
    and compare it against the signature provided in the webhook request headers.
