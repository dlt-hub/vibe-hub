- Segmentations with Parameters are not supported.
- You can have a maximum of 5 Segmentation forks in one Scenario.
- You can have a maximum of 20 Segments in a single Segmentation.
- Contact your Customer Success Manager if you don't see this trigger option in your
  account.
- Global rate window enforced (1 request every 1-100 seconds, depending on project
  size). Exceeding it returns HTTP 429.
- Webhook fail branch allows specifying further action for customers who did not manage
  to go through the webhook node.
- Batching on-events campaigns could be 180 or 170, with a maximum limit of 200.
- Bloomreach Engagement requires that credentials entered here are exclusive for this
  integration and must not be used elsewhere.
- Webhook can process the responses up to 64KB of raw unparsed data.
- This number is not always reached and guaranteed.
- Too much personalization may lead to timeouts. We recommend keeping the number of
  batch size low.
- After importing in a new instance, these parts have to be added manually
- Following adjustments or updates to webhook presets, it's necessary to manually
  update existing webhook nodes to ensure they are correctly configured, as this process
  isn't automated
- Additionally, when there are updates to a Basic Authentication, corresponding adjustments
  to webhook presets are required
- This policy should be used when 3rd party API imposes some limitations on requests
  per second or number of concurrent requests.
- Remember that the concurrency limit is just an approximation of the requests per
  second. The actual limit always depends on the latency of the API on the other side.
  It is always better to use sub-optimal requests per second to ensure you don't go
  over the limit, and it is also good practice to be aware of what happens if the
  limit is reached.
- Your API must provide HTTPS endpoint with SSL certificate signed by one of Trusted
  CAs.
- Responds in less than 1,000 ms.
- The deadline from Google for the cessation of the old API endpoint is June 2024.
- ESP operates globally, with high throughputs and extra services such as email address
  validation.
- ESP that report complained emails include Microsoft, Verizon, AOL, Yahoo, Libero.it,
  Laposte.fr, Seznam.cz, Mail.ru, Telenet.be, UPC mail.
- Starting from 2024, setting up a DMARC record for sending emails is mandatory.
- Mandatory DMARC record setup for emailing
- Scenario should not use more than 100 nodes. Ideally, keep their number below 30
  to avoid possible lags.
- Scenario should not use more than 25 email nodes. This includes different language
  versions.
- Certain campaign event statuses do not trigger scenarios when used in the 'On event'
  node.
- Importantly, campaign events that do not have a status attribute altogether will
  also not trigger a scenario.
- Unless the option 'Allow scenario triggering' in the 'add event' node is turned
  on, events added/generated from scenarios don't trigger scenarios.
- If you import it with the same timestamp, the Engagement deduplication process will
  conclude you are importing duplicates.
- The HTML content in the Visual Editor doesn't accept the logical operators `<=`.
- API requires setup of connected app in bloomreach
- Most popular email client apps don't support embedded videos in emails.
- Dark mode in emails is a relatively new feature that hasn't been standardized yet.
- You can't use bold, italics, other special formatting, or HTML/CSS code in the subject
  line in the Visual Builder.
- Blocks can be copied as either direct code (in this case HTML) or as a reference
- Choosing a block will open the block preview with the customer selector, block description,
  and parameter inputs
- HTML Blocks currently cannot be used within Webhooks. Referencing a block via its
  ID within Webhook results in a 'block function not defined' error. Instead, use
  snippets in webhooks for your objectives.
- Blocks cannot reference other blocks within themselves using {{ block('ID') }}.
- Bloomreach Engagement can help you with an out-of-the-box Email reporting dashboard.
  Contact your CSM for details.
- Bloomreach Engagement doesn’t get spam complaint data from Gmail. Use Google Postmaster
  Tools to monitor complaints from Gmail users.
- Consecutive soft bounces mean no successful deliveries (delivered/revalidated campaign
  events) between bounces.
- Recommended delivery rate during the warm-up is above 99%.
- Delivery rate below 95% requires immediate investigation.
- Clicks from links that are within VML do not show in the heatmap because the xpath
  cannot be determined.
- Try our new Performance dashboards for improved analytics and multi-channel insights.
- You can also adjust your preferences by clicking on Customize.
- Email List Hygiene Filter excludes customers who have not engaged for more than
  180 days.

- 'Don’t buy, rent or harvest email addresses: You need to know the quality of your
  mailing list.'
- 'Don’t send emails to people who don’t want or can''t receive them: This can also
  violate the GDPR.'
- 'Don’t send emails to users who haven''t opted in: GDPR prohibits this.'
- 'Don’t send emails to old or inactive addresses: These customers aren’t adding revenue
  to your business.'
- 'Be careful about the content of your emails: Using all CAPS, ending sentences with
  lots of punctuation, using too much spammy language can lead to deliverability issues.'
- 'Maintain a proper text-to-image ratio: 60:40 in favor of text is a sensible guideline.'

- Some objects like SMSCampaign may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Jinja is a powerful templating language for personalization
- No previous coding knowledge is required to use Jinja
- No specific configuration values were provided in the documentation.
- Jinja offers a functionality called filters.
- Filters return your data modified but do not produce side effects.
- When using Jinja filters like {% set variable=(input+offset)|from_timestamp('%w')%},
  the output may not always be a decimal number as might be expected, even if the
  filter typically outputs a number.
- Ensure the API keys are properly configured before making requests.
- Template importing is not supported in our implementation of Jinja.
- The basic block type `block` does not have any practical use.
- Advanced HTML skills are required for customizing the HTML block.
- Avoid deleting custom rows to prevent potential disruption of the logic.
