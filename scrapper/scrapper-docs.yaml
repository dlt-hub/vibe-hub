  - 'Basic Authentication is supported. Scrapper uses HTTP Basic Authentication where
    credentials are sent as an Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    Basic base64(username:password)". The username and password must be configured
    in the application''s environment or configuration file before requests are made.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication is supported via htpasswd file. Set the BASIC_HTPASSWD
    environment variable to the path of an htpasswd file (e.g., /auth/.htpasswd),
    and authentication will be required for all requests. Credentials are sent using
    the standard HTTP Authorization header with Basic scheme.
