auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/:
  - API authentication uses a token-based approach. Include your token as a query
    parameter named `token` in the request URL (e.g., `?token=YOURTOKEN`).
  - Authentication is passed via a query parameter named token. Include token=USERTOKEN
    as a query parameter in requests to the BlockCypher API endpoints shown.
  - Authentication is passed via the token query parameter. Include token=YOURTOKEN
    as a query parameter in requests to the API endpoint. The token serves as the
    API key for authentication.
  - 'The API requires a token-based authentication passed as a query parameter. Include
    the token parameter in requests, for example: `?token=YOURTOKEN`. The token should
    be appended to the query string for all API calls including GET and DELETE operations.'
  - The API requires a token-based authentication. The token must be passed as a string
    parameter when initializing the API client object, such as "YOURTOKEN" in the
    gobcy.API constructor for Go. The token serves as the authentication credential
    for accessing BlockCypher's API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/ethereum/:
  - Use the **before** flag as a query parameter to page through address transactions.
    If the returned Address object includes the **hasMore** attribute set to true,
    note the block height of the last transaction and pass it to the **before** parameter
    in the next request to retrieve additional transactions.
