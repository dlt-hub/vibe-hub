notes:
- The access token is active for 15 minutes, up to a maximum of 120 minutes (2 hours).
  To avoid expiration, the access token must be used (by calling an API) at least
  once every 15 minutes.
- Partner can request to update transaction.request by calling the API using a valid
  partner Token
- Requires setup of partner token for authentication
- The EPC 2.0 December ‘24 release is scheduled for December 07, 2024.
- The JavaScript Guest Library uses the Promise object extensively.
- Include polyfill(s) necessary to support ES6 Promise implementation across browsers.
- The JavaScript Guest Library uses the Promise object extensively in its public interface.
- The em-ssf-guest package does not include a polyfill as a dependency to prevent
  lock-in with a specific polyfill implementation.
- The transaction request is created by the lender - and for the life of the transaction,
  can only be updated by the lender.
- Partners can communicate the completion of a transaction by setting their response
  status to completed.
- Transaction events can be created by both the lender and the partner during the
  life of a transaction.
- Transaction events are a flexible mechanism for ancillary communication in regards
  to the parent transaction.
- Pagination is controlled via 'start' and 'limit' query parameters.
- The default value for 'start' is 0 and cannot exceed the size of the result set.
- The maximum value for 'limit' is 50.
- The X-Correlation-ID and Date headers are especially important for our troubleshooting
  - so we strongly recommend recording these headers, along with the request URL (and
  request body if applicable) in your application logs for every API request
- partnerAccessToken is valid for 300 seconds once generated
- Call transaction.refreshOrigin to generate a new partnerAccessToken if it expires
- The current Ellie Mae JavaScript framework interface exposed to Partner integrations
  does not include any events for integrations to subscribe and respond to, but watch
  this space for enhancements!
- partnerAccessToken is only valid for 300 seconds once generated
- Allows Lenders to upload files as an attachment to a new transaction.
- Implicit transaction context setting occurs when launched from existing transactions.
- Both options and resources are completely optional in the transaction update.
- Allows Lenders to initiate an event/message for the subject transaction with your
  integration
- Navigate your users back to where they left off in the host Encompass application,
  after they are done interacting with your application's user-interface
- User's are only entitled to create/update user credentials delegated solely to them.
- Allows integrations to discover the actions and features supported by the Host application
- The transactionTemplate object is only accessible to the administrator-facing view
  of a Partner application.
- User's are only entitled to create/update user credentials delegated solely to them.
  Users are not allowed to touch shared credential sets, or company level credential
  sets configured by their Administrator
- If a company credential has been marked as required in your applications credential
  requirements - and it has not been configured by the Administrator - users will
  be prompted with an error, asking them to contact their Administrator
- transactionTemplate object is only accessible to the administrator-facing view of
  a Partner application
- Navigates user to a new tab on their browser, displaying the specified target resource
- The target may refer to an accessible resource on the internet (a URL), or to an
  EPC resource object.
