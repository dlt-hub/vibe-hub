notes:
- If you don't provide a code, a new anonymous user will be created before a connection
  is added.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup.
- You must use secure HTTPS protocol, or an app-specific scheme.
- Wealth extends the scope to all other accounts (loans, savings accounts, market
  accounts, life insurances, retirement savings, company savings).
- Wealth offers a complete view of the end-user's patrimonial assets.
- Our system is able to resolve captcha automatically, but this feature is disabled
  by default.
- Real-time revenue-checking solution for better credit decisions.
- Allows online credit providers to evaluate their clients' financial profiles in
  an instant based on categorized transactions.
- Webhooks are triggered after you ask for a specific action through the API and after
  a background synchronization (every 24h by default).
- Webhook requests are emitted immediately at creation (when the related event occurs).
- Replace YOUR_DOMAIN with your actual Powens domain, without the .biapi.pro extension.
- Replace CLIENT_ID with your client application ID.
- This API is under construction and may have limited functionality.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Welcome to the webview demonstration of our API
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Powens
- Webhooks allow us to push real-time updates directly to you, ensuring a smoother
  and more efficient integration.
- Rate limiting ensures fair resource allocation and protecting both sandbox and production
  environments.
- This endpoint does not require authentication.
- As of Sept. 2023, the only supported validation mechanism is webauth.
- Requests require a user token for authentication.
- Deleting a connection results in permanent data loss.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API allows access to documents and related metadata.
