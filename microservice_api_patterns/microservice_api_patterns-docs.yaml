  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the API key as a Bearer token in
    the Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Bearer <token>", where
    the token is provided by the API provider to identify and charge the client account.'
  - GitHub API supports OAuth as the primary authentication method, but also accepts
    basic authentication using a username and API token sent via the password parameter
    (e.g., `curl -u username:token https://api.github.com/user`). Stripe API uses
    a secret key transmitted in the `Authorization` header of each request as the
    API Key, while the publishable key serves as the account identifier.

  - 'GitHub API supports OAuth as the primary authentication method, or alternatively
    basic authentication using a username and API token sent via the password parameter

  - HTTP Bearer token authentication is required. Send the Bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" (e.g., "Bearer gqmbwwB74tToo4YOPEsev5"). The API provider
    uses this token to identify the client and charge their account.
