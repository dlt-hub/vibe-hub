- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- An enhanced onboarding experience will launch in September 2025. Projects in certification
  or production will transition automatically. To retain access to sandbox-only projects,
  promote them by September 17.
- Processor integration / adjustable limit functionality is limited in some regions.
- Certain products are not available in specific regions.
- For more information about the use of cookies, please see the Visa Cookie Notice.
- VDC Playground is currently compatible with Windows only.
- Built-in VGAR compliance, meeting WCAG 2.2 A and AA standards.
- Designed with inclusivity as a foundational principle.
- New APIs and endpoints added in 2025.
- MLE is required for APIs that primarily deal with sensitive transaction data.
- Key-ID must be included as a request header in API calls.
- Please ensure to add the keyId as an additional HTTP header.
