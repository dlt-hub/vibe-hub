auth_info:
- information_source; https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/:
  - Authentication is required for downloading files from bundles using a bearer token
    passed in the Authorization header. The token should be provided as the value
    of the Authorization header in the GET request to the bundle download endpoint.
    The product API endpoints do not require authentication.
  - 'Authentication requires HTTP Basic Authentication with NASA Earthdata Login credentials
    to obtain a Bearer token via the login service. The Bearer token is then sent
    in the Authorization header for all subsequent secure API requests. The token
    expires approximately 48 hours after acquisition, and programs should handle HTTP
    403 Forbidden responses by acquiring a new token.


    Key details: Use HTTP Basic Auth (username:password) to POST to the login endpoint
    and receive a token in the response. For all subsequent requests to secure endpoints,
    include the header Authorization: Bearer {token}. Monitor for HTTP 403 status
    to detect token expiration and refresh as needed.'
  - 'Authentication to the status API requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header. Obtain the token from the login endpoint, then include it in all requests
    as Authorization: Bearer {token}.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Obtain
    a token from the authentication endpoint, then include it in requests as Authorization:
    Bearer {token}.'
  - Authorization header with bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer your-token" where your-token is obtained from a prior authentication
    request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    the number of results per page, and offset specifies the starting position. Both
    are optional query parameters passed in the request URL.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with query parameters `limit` (maximum results
    per request, required) and `offset` (number of results to skip, required). Pagination
    ends when the number of results returned is less than the specified `limit` value.
  - Use page and limit query parameters for pagination. The page parameter specifies
    the page number (starting at 0), and limit specifies results per page. Response
    includes total field for total count and data array for results.
