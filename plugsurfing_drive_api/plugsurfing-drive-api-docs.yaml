notes:
- API key must be included in the HTTP header of every request.
- Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Store it securely
  and use it only in server-to-server communications.
- New webhook event – Order Assigned
- Configurable supported countries
- Search for EV charging locations by radius, route, or batch.
- Use the distance parameter to change the search radius in meters.
- The Drive API is not meant to be called from client apps. Instead, it should be
  integrated on your backend.
- Search for charging locations by radius, route, or batch.
- Supports filtering by various criteria including availability and power type.
- Users with outstanding debt cannot be deleted.
- We reserve the right to reject deletion if less than 3 years passed since recent
  user activity.
- Only the `id` field is required when you are the Merchant on Record.
- If Plugsurfing is the Merchant on Record, the `email` field is mandatory.
- Ordering charging keys for a single user is throttled to 1 order every 5 minutes.
- Before using the createChargingKeyOrder endpoint, a manual configuration is required
  on the Plugsurfing side.
- Starting a session can take some time. Allow up to two minutes for the session to
  transition from WAITING_TO_START to STARTED.
- If a session stays in WAITING_TO_START for more than two minutes, consider it failed.
- Plugsurfing will allow sessions by default if no response is received within 3 seconds.
- We do not guarantee the delivery of events. Some Charge Point Operators (CPOs) may
  fail to send events, and events may be received in an unexpected order.
- Plugsurfing platform doesn't allow updating their card network of an existing credit-card.
- A session can be started remotely but stopped locally.
- Only chargers with REMOTE_START_STOP_CAPABLE capability can be started and stopped
  remotely.
- CDR Forwarding is only available when external clearing is chosen as a payment option.
- New fields might be added to the schema without prior notice. Ensure that unknown
  fields are ignored and do not result in errors.
- If Plugsurfing does not get any response within 3 seconds, the session will be allowed.
- If a user wants to use another network, they would need to create a new credit-card
  payment-option.
- Ensure that unknown fields are ignored and do not result in errors.
- Your system should always try to verify the signature with CURRENT and fallback
  to NEXT.
- Plugsurfing does not currently use any IP filtering to access the API.
- Access control is based on the API key exchanged during the Credentials module handshake.
- PUSH of Locations / EVSEs / connectors not supported
- Plugsurfing is more lenient than the OCPI specification for certain properties
- You are allowed to do Location pull API requests up to once per minute (pagination
  excluded).
- CANCEL_RESERVATION command is not supported.
- RESERVE_NOW command is not supported.
- START_SESSION command is supported.
- STOP_SESSION command is supported.
- UNLOCK_CONNECTOR command is not supported.
- PULL not supported
- Real-time Auth not supported
- PATCH of sessions not supported
- Plugsurfing does not support pushing updates of charging stations.
- The API is lenient on certain location field validations.
- PULL not supported - Only PUSH, Plugsurfing will push the CDRs to the EMP
- Plugsurfing is a bit more lenient than the OCPI specification for a set of properties
  when receiving CDRs from CPOs
- Not all commands are supported; unsupported commands will return NOT_SUPPORTED
- Requests that are rejected due to exceeding the per-minute limit do not count against
  the daily limit.
- PULL not supported — Plugsurfing only supports pushing sessions
- Real-time Auth not supported — Authorization based on status (valid = true/false)
  of the token
- PATCH of sessions not supported — No session updates during ongoing session
- Availability is calculated as the percentage of uptime for the features listed above
  on a monthly basis.
- Downtime is measured in minutes when a feature is inaccessible.
- Plugsurfing is a bit more lenient than the OCPI specification for a set of properties
  when receiving CDRs from CPOs.
- Drive API operates on a multi-tenant model, serving multiple users simultaneously.
- 'The API''s target availability is defined in two categories: Core features (99.7%)
  and Secondary features (99%).'
- A major outage occurs when 100% of users are affected.
- A partial outage, where only a subset of users is impacted, counts as 30% of its
  timespan toward the total downtime in a month.
