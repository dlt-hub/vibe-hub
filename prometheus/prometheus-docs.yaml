auth_info:
- information_source; https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/:
  - The documentation describes HTTP client settings that include authentication methods
    such as basic auth and authorization, along with proxy configurations and TLS
    options. For Marathon SD specifically, optional token-based authentication is
    supported via the auth_token parameter, which is mutually exclusive with auth_token_file
    and other authentication mechanisms, following Mesosphere's token-based authentication
    approach.
  - 'The provided text contains configuration options for OVHcloud discovery and PuppetDB
    service discovery. The OVHcloud section includes three credential fields: application_key,
    application_secret, and consumer_key. These are required credentials for accessing
    the OVHcloud API at https://api.ovh.com. The application_key is a string while
    application_secret and consumer_key are secrets that must be provided in the configuration.
    The endpoint parameter defaults to "ovh-eu" and specifies which OVHcloud API endpoint
    to use. No other authentication mechanisms are described in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/:
  - 'The HTTP Service Discovery endpoint supports multiple authentication mechanisms:
    TLS, Basic auth, Authorization header, and OAuth2. Prometheus sends a GET request
    with the X-Prometheus-Refresh-Interval-Seconds header and expects a JSON response
    with Content-Type application/json.'
- information_source; https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/:
  - Rocketchat notifications require two authentication credentials sent as sender
    token and token_id. These can be provided either directly as secrets or via separate
    files, with token and token_file being mutually exclusive, and token_id and token_id_file
    being mutually exclusive. The credentials are personal access tokens as documented
    in the Rocketchat user panel.
