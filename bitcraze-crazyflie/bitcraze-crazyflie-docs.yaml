notes:
- The feed is updated hourly.
- Open source project with extensive library support.
- Supports wireless firmware updates and on-board charging.
- Different PID tuning parameters might be needed for it to fly well. Currently this
  has to be hard coded. Later this will be saved in the EEPROM or in the 1-wire memory.
- External battery voltage/current reading is implemented but no logic behind it,
  so don’t run out of battery.
- The ESC PWM output is set by default to 400Hz. Use ESCs which can handle this or
  compile with new value. There is also the possibility to enable OneShot125 output.
- It is wise to do a range test before flying far away.
- Be safe, it is experimental software. Run all testing without props!
- This deck is not compatible with the Crazyflie 2.1 Brushless by default.
- Automatic detection of expansion board using 1-wire memory.
- Automatic detection of deck via 1-wire memory
- Low profile piezo buzzer for tone and melody generation
- The SD-card used in the deck must be formatted as a FAT32 file system (exFAT does
  not work).
- Logging needs to be explicitly stopped by setting the `usd.logging` parameter to
  0, which protects the logfile data with a CRC32.
- We usually do not provide support for these projects but we have collected a few
  links to help any one that is interested.
- These projects may or may not be actively maintained. We do not take any responsibility
  for the functionality or compatibility in any way.
- We prefer human contact and we are not interested in remote work solutions.
- We do not have the capacity to handle applications from outside the EU due to visa
  and work permit administration.
- Supports Python 3.13
- Improved battery voltage compensation for better flight performance
- The hybrid mode functionality is experimental and has not been merged to master
  yet.
- The outlier filter implementation is complex and requires optimization for different
  system setups.
- The Loco Positioning System can run in Two Way Ranging (TWR) or Time Difference
  of Arrival (TDoA) modes.
- 'Improved user interface: Use interactive selection if command line parameters are
  missing'
- 'Added access to memory subsystem: Raw access to memories, Initialize, erase and
  display decoded information from EEPROM and 1-wire memories'
- The Color LED Deck brings fully programmable lighting to your Crazyflie, allowing
  you to create and control custom light patterns in real time.
- The new compensation method ensures that thrust is consistent across the full range
  of battery charge.
- Running with python 3.13 on macOS is not officially supported
- You will need to log out and log in again in order to be a member of the plugdev
  group.
- Some basic experience with python is required.
- Installation of cflib should be done using pip3.
- Make sure that you have python3 installed.
- The script connects to the Crazyflie using a radio URI.
- Requires connected app setup for usage
- Uses Simple Log and Parameter methods for interaction with Crazyflie.
- The flow deck should be correctly attached to the Crazyflie.
- Different positioning systems and decks may require checking different parameters.
- Uses MotionCommander for movement control
- BOX_LIMIT is set to 0.5
- Requires the Crazyflie and Flow deck to operate correctly.
- Make sure the deck is attached to avoid crashes.
- The functions mc.start_back() and mc.start_forward() are non-blocking
- Uses Crazyflie API to control swarm behavior
- Ensure all Crazyflies have the latest firmware
- The library is asynchronous and based on callbacks for events.
- The maximum length for a log packet is 26 bytes.
- The logging cannot be started until you are connected to a Crazyflie.
- A CRTP packet has a maximum data size of 30 bytes, which sets an upper limit to
  the number of variables that can be used in one logging configuration.
- The logging cannot be started until you are connected to a Crazyflie
- A CRTP packet has a maximum data size of 30 bytes, which limits the number of variables
  in one logging configuration.
- The minimum period of a log configuration is multiples of 10ms.
- Currently there is an issue with the new Raspberry pi 5 and these instructions.
- If you see the a CRC error when running the script, make sure to install the cflib
  from source.
- If the script hangs with connecting, restart the crazyflie
- Note that these are old instructions and they might not work anymore
- Use pip3 instead of pip in all installation commands on Ubuntu 20.04
- For Python 3.12+ on macOS, install libusb using Homebrew
- Assumes basic experience with python
- Requires installation of cflib
- The Crazyflie connects via a radio URI.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Good practice to reset parameters to original values after testing
- Uses MotionCommander to control Crazyflie movements.
- Uses Crazyflie library for motion control.
- Ensure the flow deck is attached before attempting to fly.
- Now you are able to send velocity commands to the Crazyflie and react upon logging
  and parameters variables.
- Requires a positioning system for accurate position estimation.
- The Crazyflie must have the latest firmware installed.
- You can experiment with different behaviors for each Crazyfly.
- If you call `set_value()` and then directly call `get_value()` for a parameter,
  you might not read back the new value, but get the old one instead.
- Use the callback method if you need to be certain that you get the correct value
  after an update.
- '`get_value()` and `set_value()` can not be called from callbacks until the Crazyflie
  is fully connected.'
- Logging cannot be started until connected to a Crazyflie
- CRTP packets have a maximum data size of 30 bytes
- Logging cannot be started until you are connected to a Crazyflie
- A CRTP packet has a maximum data size of 30 bytes, setting an upper limit to the
  number of variables
- A CRTP packet has a maximum data size of 30 bytes
- The Crazyflie takes off when entering the 'with' section and lands when exiting.
- It is intended to be used with a positioning system such as Loco, the lighthouse
  or a mocap system.
- The EEPROM stores configuration data, which persists even after a firmware update.
errors:
- 'OUTLIER_DETECTED: Measurement rejected as an outlier.'
- 'TRACKING_LOST: Position tracking has been lost.'
- 'No flow deck detected: Check the deck connection.'
- 'Deck is NOT attached: Ensure proper setup.'
- 'AttributeError: cpu.flash is read-only!'
- 'Connection error: Ensure the Crazyflies are powered on and within range.'
- 'Position estimation variance too high: Reset estimators before takeoff.'
