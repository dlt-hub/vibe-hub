auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.asana.com/docs/api-explorer:
  - The API uses personal access tokens for authentication. Provide your personal
    access token on the right side of the page when making requests through the API
    explorer.
  - The Asana REST API requires authentication using a personal access token (PAT).
    Include the PAT in the Authorization header as a Bearer token when making requests
    to authenticate and access the API.
- information_source; https://developers.asana.com/docs/authentication:
  - Personal access token (PAT) authentication is the primary method described. PATs
    are long-lived tokens generated in the developer console that should be stored
    securely and provide the same permissions as the user who created them. The token
    is used for programmatic API authentication and actions are attributed to the
    user who generated the PAT in the Asana web product. View only license users have
    limited API access. For multi-user apps, OAuth is recommended instead.
- information_source; https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth:
  - Asana OAuth2 token revocation and introspection use form-encoded POST requests.
    Token revocation requires client_id, client_secret, and token (refresh token)
    in the request body sent to https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_revoke. Token introspection
    requires the token parameter in a form-encoded body sent to https://app.asana.com/-/token_info
    and returns bearer token information including token_type, expires_in, exp, and
    scope.
  - 'Asana uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Exchange an authorization code for
    an access token by making a POST request to https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_token
    with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded body containing grant_type
    (authorization_code or refresh_token), client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri,
    code, and code_verifier. For token refresh, use grant_type refresh_token with
    refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.asana.com/reference/searchtasksforworkspace:
  - Pagination for this search endpoint is manual rather than traditional. The `limit`
    query parameter specifies page size with a maximum of 100 items. Since results
    are unstable, you must sort by creation time and modify subsequent queries to
    exclude already-seen data to paginate through results.
