In this guide, we'll set up a complete Osano data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def osano_consent_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.osano.com/v2/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "consent_manager",
            "cookie-consent-configurations",
            "portal-messages"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='osano_consent_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='osano_consent_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(osano_consent_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from osano_consent‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Consent Management: Manage user consents and configurations.
- User Data Management: Handle user data searches and profile management.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Osano workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@osano_consent-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Osano support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:osano_consent duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@osano_consent-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Osano API, as specified in @osano_consent-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "consent_manager" and "cookie-consent-configurations" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in osano_consent_pipeline.py and name the pipeline osano_consent_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python osano_consent_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is primarily done using OAuth2 for secure access. Tokens are used in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Specific endpoints might require different types of keys, such as Osano API key or Unified Consent API key, depending on the action.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.osano.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python osano_consent_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline osano_consent load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset osano_consent_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/osano_consent.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline osano_consent_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("osano_consent_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "consent_manager" table as Pandas frame
   data."consent_manager".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Make sure to handle different keys for different endpoints carefully. Always check for the active status of API keys and ensure they haven't expired. Be aware of the limitations on file sizes (1MB for CSV) and structure for uploads. Admin permissions are required for certain operations, and specific scopes must be set correctly at the time of key generation. Errors in key details or permissions could lead to unauthorized access errors.
