notes:
- Data Connections can be set for the various SPOD sites, such as Staging, QA and
  Production.
- Refer to the documentation Known Limitations for API calls in Evolve.
- Users receive an email notification when they have been added to a group.
- Groups and group permissions are specific to each app.
- The Visitor role should not be provided along with any other role.
- Licenses should not be assigned to users who have only the Visitor role.
- Digital Access License must be activated for Digital Access API to function.
- SAP Data API license must be activated on the Evolve system for SAP Data API to
  function.
- The Digital Access License for process must be activated in the Evolve system.
- Value of the key ProcessExtensionEnable should be set True.
- SAP Data API does not support chained and multi script.
- Evolve web and service worker do not support GUI script based Transaction.
- Originators will never be reassigned to their own tasks unless dictated by the workflow
  solution design.
- While creating new REST API data connection, name of data connection is not auto-populated.
- Validation is performed automatically when you deploy a solution.
- Form Control data is validated when deploying a solution.
- Solution names are case sensitive.
- Named ranges will be promoted to the workflow from Excel when a matching solution
  field exists.
- Accessing files in the file library via link, with extension types .js, .css, .png,
  .jpg, .gif, .svg can be downloaded without any authentication. Other file extensions
  require authentication.
- When you deploy a solution, form control data is validated. If a required property
  is not found, you will receive an error message and information that enables you
  to address the issue.
- Once a solution is deployed, the workflow node and form control names cannot be
  changed.
- The browser language must be set to English when translating solutions. Other browser
  languages are not supported.
- If you make modifications to dropdown or ComboBoxes for which you have manually
  created options (the range is set manually), re-translate the solution before deploying
  it.
- Translate to dropdown will pick setting as per user locale in the Form preview.
- You can import and export Name Templates, at both the global and local app levels.
- 'You cannot use the following invalid file name characters in Name Template names:
  @!*,.?^&%'
- Name templates defined in a solution can only be used within the solution in which
  they are created. A Global Name Template is a name template stored on a Global or
  App level based on the selection made during template creation.
- When using raw query option with Solution Data Library or Reference Data connections,
  provide the Query or Filter with brackets around the connection column name.
- Provide the Decimal Field value in single quotes when the decimal field column is
  used in a filter.
- The Plug-ins Guide covers all plug-ins supported in Evolve 20.2.
- App Name, Solution Name, and Library Name parameters are validated when deploying
  solutions that include plug-ins.
- Each type of rule is governed by a common set of general properties.
- If a Solution Data Library has a calculated column and that column is mapped to
  a form field, the form field must be designated read-only.
- Fields beginning with numbers cannot be added.
- If a string type field is added to a Solution Data Library, existing records will
  include a Null (zero) value for this newly-added field.
- Solution connection names are case sensitive.
- Apps to which a solution is imported must have a connection with the same name as
  the connection in the original app.
- Solution Developers can manage user-defined solution fields.
- They cannot manage system-defined solution fields; these are visible only as they
  are within the fixed fields on the Documents, Processes, or Tasks pages.
- The Solution Lock duration is configured using the workflow configuration key titled
  SolutionLock.
- The duration of the solution lock is expressed as a value in minutes. If the value
  is set to 0, the solution locking feature is turned off.
- When Autosave is enabled for a solution, you may receive the error 'Solution_NOT_Updateable'
  when you click Save Solution.
- Within the TeamFromRole type, you can lock tasks while you work with them and unlock
  (or 'release') them when you complete your work with them.
- This feature allows you to contribute to a task without the possibility of overwriting
  others’ work.
- Opening a task will lock that task for anyone accessing it for 30 minutes (default
  duration).
- The task can be unlocked by the user who locked the task or by the administrator.
- As a user who locked the task, you can unlock the task by closing or saving the
  task.
- For third-party webservices we support webservices on SOAP 1.1 version only.
- No need to set any input schema, as API doesn't expect any payload.
- Set the Output schema of one product only as connection just needs the schema and
  not exact output with multiple product’s data.
- Time part will be lost when posting using Date-picker control.
- Date will always be returned in UTC.
- Only ISO and Ticks (i.e. Microsoft JSON Date format) is supported.
- Only REST API connection with Get operation is supported with these controls.
- Only two level Nesting is supported in REST APIs, similar to the repeating tables.
- Only Response Headers are supported in REST APIs. Content-Type header is not supported
  as it is a Response Content Header.
- API Solution Data connection will be on same design of other Data connections and
  can be used with supported Form controls and Plugins.
- For Evolve - EnterWorks returns maximum of 1000 records when no filter is applied.
- If key is not added, system will fetch maximum 500 records.
- This table was last updated in January, 2022.
errors:
- 'ErrorCode: Returns error code in case of run failure.'
- 'Message: Returns message corresponding to ErrorCode returned.'
- An unexpected error occurred on the server. Have your administrator check the server
  logs.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Ensure EnterworksMaxReadCount is not set above 1000.'
