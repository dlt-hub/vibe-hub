notes:
- Uses Adapter system for configuration with React versions.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Jsdom requires node 4 or above.
- React Native uses React as a dependency rather than a forked version of the library.
- Ensure that the test runs with the jestEnvironment set to jsdom.
- Enzyme requires React 0.14 and react-dom
- Enzyme with React 0.14 requires the test utilities addon
- 'If you are wanting to use enzyme with React 0.13, but don''t already have React
  0.13 installed, you should do so: npm i react@0.13 --save'
- 'Next, to get started with enzyme, you can simply install it with npm: npm i --save-dev
  enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-13'
- .hasClass() expects a class name, NOT a CSS selector. .hasClass('.foo') should be
  .hasClass('foo')
- can only be called on a wrapper of a single node
- .matchesElement() expects a ReactElement, not a selector (like many other methods).
- .setContext() can only be used on a wrapper that was initially created with a call
  to shallow() that includes a context specified in the options argument.
- The root component you are rendering must have a contextTypes static property.
- can only be called on a wrapper instance that is also the root instance.
- Currently, event simulation for the shallow renderer does not propagate as one would
  normally expect in a real environment.
- can only be called on a wrapper instance that is also the root instance
- this does not force a re-render. Use wrapper.setProps({}) to force a re-render
- .containsAllMatchingElements() expects an array of ReactElement, not a selector
  (like many other methods). Make sure that when you are calling it you are calling
  it with an array of ReactElement or a JSX expression.
- Keep in mind that this method determines matching based on the matching of the node's
  children as well.
- can only be called on a wrapper of a single node.
- will raise if called on a wrapper of a stateless functional component.
- With React 16 and above, instance() returns null for stateless functional components.
- 'Deprecated: Use .exists() instead.'
- .setContext() can only be used on a wrapper that was initially created with a call
  to mount() that includes a context specified in the options argument.
- Prior to v3.8.0 of enzyme, can only be called on a wrapper instance that is also
  the root instance.
- As noted in the function signature above passing a mock event is optional.
- Undefined properties are not allowed in the object property selector and will cause
  an error
- If you have to search by undefined property value, use .findWhere() instead
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Common Gotchas in usage.
- 'TypeError: Enzyme::Props can''t have ''undefined'' values. Try using ''findWhere()''
  instead.'
