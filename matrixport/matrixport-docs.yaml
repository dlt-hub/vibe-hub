auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.matrixport.com/docs/en-us/phoenix.html:
  - 'API key authentication via the x-matrixport-access-key header, combined with
    request signing using a signature query parameter (HMAC-based) and timestamp in
    milliseconds. Each request requires a unique x-request-id header.


    Required headers: x-matrixport-access-key (API key), x-request-id (unique request
    identifier). Required query parameters: signature (HMAC signature), timestamp
    (epoch time in milliseconds). The signature and timestamp are used to verify request
    authenticity and prevent replay attacks.'
  - 'API key authentication via the x-matrixport-access-key header, plus request signing
    with signature and timestamp fields in the JSON body. The x-request-id header
    is also required for request tracking.


    Header x-matrixport-access-key: your API key value. Header x-request-id: unique
    request identifier string. Request body must include signature field (HMAC or
    similar signature of the request) and timestamp field (millisecond epoch time
    as string, e.g. "1711606452000").'
  - Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. Requests require a signature
    parameter calculated by HMAC-SHA256 hashing the API path concatenated with encoded
    request parameters using a secret key, with the hexadecimal digest sent as the
    signature parameter. Requests must include a timestamp parameter that must not
    differ from server timestamp by more than 5000ms, or the request will be rejected.
    Authentication failure returns HTTP 412 with message "Account credentials is invalid".
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication is required. The signature is calculated
    by hex-encoding HMAC-SHA256 of the API secret key and encoded request parameters,
    then concatenated with the endpoint URL and an ampersand. Include the signature
    and timestamp as query parameters, and provide the matrixport access key via the
    x-matrixport-access-key header and a unique request ID via the x-request-id header.
  - 'Requests require two custom headers: x-matrixport-access-key (containing your
    API key) and x-request-id (a unique request identifier). Additionally, the request
    body must include a signature field and a timestamp field, indicating HMAC-based
    request signing is required.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.matrixport.com/docs/en-us/smart_trend.html:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset defaults to 0, and limit
    defaults to 10 items per page. The response includes a count field indicating
    total results. Continue paginating by incrementing offset by the limit value until
    fewer than limit items are returned.
  - offset and limit are query string parameters for pagination. offset specifies
    the starting position (optional), and limit specifies the number of results per
    page (optional). The response structure is not fully shown, but these parameters
    control which subset of orders is returned.
- information_source; https://www.matrixport.com/docs/en-us/wallet.html:
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, default 10) and offset (optional, default 1)
    query parameters. The response returns an array of deposit records without explicit
    pagination metadata fields like next or has_more.
  - The endpoint uses limit (int, optional, default 10) as a query parameter to control
    the number of results returned. The start_id (string, optional) parameter enables
    cursor-based pagination by specifying where to start retrieving records. The response
    returns an array of bills; use the last bill's sn value as the next start_id to
    fetch subsequent pages.
  - The endpoint uses limit and offset query parameters for pagination. The limit
    parameter controls the number of items returned per request (example shows limit=10),
    and offset specifies the starting position (example shows offset=0). The response
    contains an items array with deposit records; continue paginating by incrementing
    the offset parameter by the limit value until fewer items than the limit are returned.
