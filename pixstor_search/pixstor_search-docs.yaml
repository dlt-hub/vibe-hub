  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme with JWT. Include the JWT access token
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN" for API
    requests like PATCH to /api/configurations/.'
  - The REST API uses client key authentication. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header with the format "Api-Key $APIKEY", where $APIKEY is the actual key value.
    This is required when making requests to the sites endpoint, such as GET requests
    to http://example.com/api/sites/1/.
  - 'The configurations endpoint requires JWT Authentication. Send requests with an
    Authorization header containing a Bearer token: Authorization: Bearer $JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN.
    Client key authentication is not supported for this endpoint.'
