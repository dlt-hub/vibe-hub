auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.jobbers.com/restoneapi/docs/index.html:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" for both GET and POST requests to the echo endpoints.
  - Bearer token authentication is used for API access. After obtaining an access_token
    (via OAuth2 authorization_code grant or similar), include it in requests to protected
    endpoints. The access_token is a UUID string with a 3600-second expiration, and
    token_type is always "bearer". Pass the ACCESS_TOKEN to endpoints like GET /oneapi/v0/current
    to retrieve authenticated entity information.
  - Gets the stock of passes available belonging to the authenticated enterprise.
    The API requires an ACCESS_TOKEN parameter passed to the doGet function. The exact
    mechanism for sending this token (header name, query parameter, or other method)
    is not explicitly specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - 'Jobbers API uses OAuth2 authentication. POST your API KEY and API SECRET KEY
    to the authentication endpoint to receive an access_token. Include the access_token
    in all subsequent requests via the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer
    ACCESS_TOKEN". Tokens expire and must be renewed by re-authenticating; refresh
    tokens are not currently supported.'
  - Sends API key and API Secret Key via POST to /oneapi/authentication/token endpoint
    with grant_type set to 'password', username set to API_KEY, and password set to
    API_SECRET_KEY. Returns an access_token in the response that should be used for
    subsequent API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.jobbers.com/restoneapi/docs/index.html:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter size (default or unspecified value not
    stated) to control number of messages returned per request. Response structure
    and fields for navigating to next page or indicating total results are not documented.
  - The `size` parameter is a mandatory query parameter that specifies the number
    of messages to retrieve per request. The response returns a JSON array of messages
    with fields including id, received, author_type, content, type, and media_url,
    but no pagination metadata or navigation fields are provided, so continuation
    method is unclear.
