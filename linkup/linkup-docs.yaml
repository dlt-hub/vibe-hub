notes:
- Uses structured output feature to receive responses in a custom format
- Get your API key by creating a Linkup account for free.
- Uses API key for authentication
- The API requires proper OAuth setup for authentication.
- Retrieves raw HTML or markdown content of any webpage
- Linkup was designed from the ground up to be the most accurate search engine for
  AIs.
- Linkup has made partnerships with trusted data providers and premium information
  sources.
- Requires an API key for access
- The API returns standard HTTP status codes
- No credit is deducted for failed requests
- Check for public roadmap items and statuses on the company website.
- Authorization requires a bearer token.
- Authorization required in the form 'Bearer <token>'.
- No credit is subtracted when an error occurs, whether it is because of a missing
  parameter, an internal server error, but also when we were not able to find anything
  relevant to your query.
- For our `/search` endpoint, our rate limits are currently set at `10 queries per
  second` per account.
- Authorization requires a Bearer token.
- Depending on the depth parameter, results may be faster (standard) or slower but
  more complete (deep).
- Uses structured output feature to ensure well-formatted results
- 'Rate Limiting: Use asyncio / Promise.allSettled with a limiter when batch‑processing
  thousands.'
- Requires setup of Linkup API key from app.linkup.so
- Requires a Linkup API key for making requests
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Use deep for more thorough results
- Requires API key to be included in the Authorization header.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Never put your API KEYS directly in your code. Always include them in a .env file.
