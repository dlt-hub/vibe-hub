auth_info:
- information_source; https://upcdatabase.org/api-auth:
  - The UPC Database API uses OAuth token-based authentication. Generate an OAuth
    token via the API Keys section of your account, then authenticate by including
    an Authorization header with the format "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" in all HTTPS requests.
    Alternatively, you can pass the token as an apikey query parameter, though this
    method is not OAuth compliant.
