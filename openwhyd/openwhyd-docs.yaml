auth_info:
- information_source; https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API.html:
  - The user who created the provided playlist must be logged in based on cookie before
    using playlist modification endpoints (rename, delete, setOrder). Cookie-based
    session authentication is required for these operations.
  - User must be logged in, which is verified through an openwhyd session cookie that
    must be included in requests. Certain endpoints like updating playlist images
    and sharing playlists require the authenticated user (based on cookie) to be the
    owner of the playlist.
  - User must be logged in, with openwhyd session cookie included in the request.
    This applies to endpoints that require authentication, such as POST /api/post/<pId>/sendToUsers
    and POST /api/playlist.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API.html:
  - 'Cursor-based pagination using optional query parameters: after (id of last post
    from previous page) and before (id of first post currently). Use the post id values
    from responses to construct subsequent requests for the next or previous page.'
  - The API uses limit-offset pagination. The limit parameter (optional, default 20)
    controls the number of posts returned per request. The after parameter (optional)
    specifies a post identifier (pId) from which to fetch subsequent entries, enabling
    pagination through result sets.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with skip (number of items to skip, optional)
    and limit (number of items to return, optional, default 50) query parameters for
    the /api/follow/fetchFollowers and /api/follow/fetchFollowing endpoints. The response
    is a JSON array; pagination continues by incrementing the skip parameter until
    fewer than limit items are returned.
  - The API uses two different pagination schemes. For the incoming stream endpoint,
    use the optional limit parameter (int) to specify number of posts returned, and
    use the after parameter (string, post id) to paginate forward or before parameter
    (string, post id) to get fresher posts. For the hot tracks endpoint, use the optional
    limit parameter (int) for number of tracks and skip parameter (int) to skip tracks
    for pagination.
  - The endpoint supports offset-based pagination using the "after" parameter (optional
    string) which accepts the id of the last post from the previous page to fetch
    the next set of posts, and an optional "limit" parameter (int) to control the
    number of posts returned per request. A "before" parameter (optional string) can
    be used to fetch fresher posts since a given post id.
