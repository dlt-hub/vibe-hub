- information_source; https://docs.butlr.io/getting-started/mint-client-credentials:
  - 'Authentication uses JWT bearer tokens. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" for all requests to the M2M client
    endpoints.'
  - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant Type is used for server-to-server authentication.
    All endpoints require a valid JWT token sent in the Authorization header as Bearer
    your-jwt-token.
  - The API requires JWT bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer your-jwt-token". The token must be valid and contain a client_id claim;
    requests with missing, malformed, or client_id-less tokens will receive a 401
    Unauthorized response.
  - 'The API uses JWT bearer token authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" for all requests. Client credentials
    (client_id and client_secret) are issued upon M2M client creation and can be used
    for subsequent authentication flows. The API authorizes access via OAuth2 scopes
    including read/write/delete permissions for spaces, rooms, sensors, and hives.'

  - Authentication uses OAuth2.0 Client Credentials Grant with JWT bearer tokens.
    First, POST to https://api.butlr.io/api/v2/clients/login with client_id, client_secret,
    audience set to "https://butlrauth/", and grant_type set to "client_credentials"

    subsequent API requests via the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
