  : - 'API key authentication is sent via the Authorization header with the token
      value directly, for example Authorization: 4fa7b65b6fcb951b6185000c699a22450b1cd060.
      The authentication class is configured in the Tastypie resource Meta class using
      the authentication parameter set to a custom authentication handler like CustomApiKeyAuthent.'
    - API key authentication is used. Tastypie automatically generates an API key
      for each user via a post_save signal on the User model. The API key is created
      in the tastypie.models.ApiKey table and associated with the user account. To
      authenticate requests, include the username and API key as credentials in your
      REST API calls to Tastypie resources.
