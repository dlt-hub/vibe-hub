auth_info:
- information_source; https://prezi.com/p/abehzggkkvbe/walkthrough-of-e-commerce-json-rest-api-implementation/:
  - JWT (JSON Web Token) with HS256 algorithm is used for authentication. Passwords
    are hashed with BCrypt. JWTs are implemented for session management and user authentication
    in the REST API.
  - Users authenticate using Bearer tokens obtained during login or registration.
    The GET /api/v1/users/me endpoint requires a Bearer token sent in the Authorization
    header to retrieve authenticated user profile details. Tokens are returned upon
    successful POST /api/v1/auth/login (with email and password) or POST /api/v1/auth/register
    (with username, email, and password).
