notes:
- API resources allow for unified access for various devices.
- Create a free account in Thinger.io cloud platform to start.
- The basic example contains two simple resources to send and retrieve to the device.
- Connect devices using various protocols including IOTMP, MQTT, Sigfox, LoraWAN,
  and HTTP.
- Simplifies cloud connectivity for Arduino-compatible devices.
- Extra attention must be taken while calling resources, in order to avoid uncontrolled
  recurrency. If the interval is too short, the server will lock the device connection.
- Enable DEBUG traces for better troubleshooting.
- 'Uses Thinger.io Access Token with permissions: ListDevices, AccessDeviceResources,
  ReadDeviceStatistics, ListProducts.'
- It is required to include lib_archive = no to platformio.ini configuration file.
- Remote console allows remote access to devices for logging and configuration.
- Sigfox only supports 12 bytes of payload per message
- Sigfox allows only 140 messages a day.
- Some LoRaWAN gateways include built-in LNS functionality. Support for this type
  of integration is currently being explored.
- This integration can't expose 100% of Thinger.io features and benefits in terms
  of communication efficiency, real-time data and device administration.
- An empty 200 OK status message should be received.
- Use JSON as the payload type for the device messages stored by buckets.
- It is recommended to use SSL/TLS communication using the port 8883.
- Requires a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, and a terminal or SSH access.
- Tested with Debian Buster version.
- Device must be registered to access the cloud.
- All requests to the platform are implicitly signed with an access token obtained
  from the username and password.
- Data buckets can hold time series data and other types of events.
- Data buckets can be created from device resources, write calls, API requests, or
  MQTT topics.
- Some widgets support the use of processing functions, which allow you to transform
  or manipulate the data before it's displayed.
- An endpoint can be defined as a target destination that can be called by devices.
- Real-time monitoring of device status
- Supports predictive maintenance and security alerts
- Every REST API request must be authenticated in order to take effect.
- Each defined geofence will create in the lower panel a profile that will allow configuring
  its behavior.
- The first release of this feature doesn't work with Thinger.io software client devices
  and MQTT devices.
- Assets section allows visualization on the map of all devices created in the selected
  project.
- Properties created in an Asset Type will be inherited by every associated device.
- Geofencing allows defining a virtual perimeter over geographical areas.
- This section explains how to use the project management tool to classify resources
  and share them with other user accounts.
- Only Admin accounts are able to create other user accounts.
- The number of user accounts that can be created in an instance is defined during
  the contracting and deployment of the server.
- After modifying any of the subscription parameters Thinger.io server instance needs
  to be reset in order to update the configuration file values.
- This feature is only available in professional licenses, so only Medium, Large and
  Unlimited licenses can create custom web domain profiles.
- This feature is reserved for Admin role accounts.
- Freemium accounts are perfect for learning and testing the Thinger.io platform with
  only a few limitations.
- Thinger.io supports private cloud deployments that can be automatically launched
  from the pricing page.
- Access token expires in around 2 hours from its issue date.
- Refresh token has a validity of around 2 months from the issue date.
- 'Community Release Date: 22-01-2025.'
- 'Private Servers Release Date: 29-01-2024.'
- 'Release Date: 11-03-2024'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Geofences are not working for some polygons.
- Fix a problem with the min and max y-axis on the time series chart when set to zero.
- Fix legacy bug regarding buckets query & merging.
- Default property values can be defined for all devices within a Product.
- Each bucket identifier must be unique within the user account.
- The bucket must NOT be created manually, as the product is able to initialize it
  automatically with the required configuration.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Thinger.io
