notes:
- Mapplic map data is stored as JSON, or optionally, location data can be stored as
  CSV.
- Using a web server is required because browsers enforce the Cross-Origin Resource
  Sharing (CORS) policy.
- For security reasons, restrict the use of the map builder to local environments
  or password-protected pages.
- Every map requires a minimum of one layer, but itâ€™s possible to have multiple layers.
- If the map was generated using the Add new button, a layer is already preconfigured.
- Last updated on September 19, 2025
- Writing custom styles requires the understanding of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
  which falls outside the scope of this documentation.
- Wayfinding feature is only accessible with the Professional plan.
