notes:
- Seedance PRO is an advanced generative AI model built to convert text and image
  inputs into rich, dynamic videos.
- SegFit v1.3 enables hyper-realistic virtual try-ons.
- Automatic garment masking detects clothing edges.
- High-resolution images (≥1024px) are recommended for best results.
- Automatic garment masking reduces manual editing time significantly.
- 'Generates 480p or 720p videos with just one image of the attire: flat-lay, actual
  model photo or Mannequin image, no prompts required.'
- This workflows generates 720p fashion videos with just one image, no prompts needed.
- This workflow used Flux Kontext Max to create an image that acts as a starting point
  for SegFit 1.3.
- This model uses the weights from Stable Diffusion to generate new images from an
  input image.
- Story Diffusion leverages the power of diffusion models to generate a series of
  images that cohesively depict your story's scenes.
- Fooocus is an image generating framework that is based on Stable Diffusion.
- 'Ease of Use: Fooocus is designed to be user-friendly.'
- 'Quality Images: Fooocus has optimized the Stable Diffusion pipeline to deliver
  excellent images.'
- A comprehensive guide for this model is being prepared and will be available soon.
- Start building with a free account or consult an expert for your Pro or Enterprise
  needs.
- Early access limits outputs to 720p and 8 seconds.
- It struggles with maintaining consistency in complex scenes or intricate motions.

- Seedance PRO transforms text and images into engaging 720p dynamic videos with cinematic
  storytelling.
- Use of API requires obtaining an API key.
- The Stable Diffusion SDXL 1.0 operates under the OpenRail++ license, allowing for
  distribution, sublicensing, and commercial utilization.
- Direct commercial use without proper authorization is prohibited.
- This model does not support GIF or Video, therefore the target face image should
  be a static image only.
- GIF Faceswap transforms static images into dynamic characters using face analysis.
