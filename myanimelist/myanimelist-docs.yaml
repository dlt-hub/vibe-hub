pagination_info:
- information_source; https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2:
  - Endpoints that return a list use limit and offset query parameters for pagination.
    The limit parameter specifies the number of results per request, and offset specifies
    the starting position. No response fields indicating pagination state are documented.
  - Paginated responses use a "paging" object containing "previous" and "next" fields
    with full URLs to navigate between pages. The data is returned in a "data" array.
    To paginate, use the URL from the "next" field in the paging object for the subsequent
    request; stop when "next" is absent or null.
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, default 100) and offset (integer, default 0) query
    parameters. Continue paginating by incrementing offset until fewer than limit
    results are returned, indicating the final page.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer, default 100) and offset (query
    parameter, integer, default 0) to control page size and starting position respectively.
    Stop paginating when the number of results returned is less than the limit value.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit controls page size (default
    100, max 100), and offset specifies the starting position (default 0). Use offset
    values to navigate through results.
