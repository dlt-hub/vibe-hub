notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- DAI is also susceptible to the known ERC20 race condition
- A bug in the Vat could be catastrophic and could lead to the loss (or locking) of
  all Dai and Collateral in the system.
- Governance can authorize new modules against the Vat.
- When a user desires to enter the system and interact with the dss contracts, they
  must use one of the join contracts.
- If there was a contract bug in a join contract and a user was to call join by accident,
  they can still retrieve their tokens back through the corresponding exit call on
  the given join contract.
- Uses Dutch auctions which settle instantly
- No minimum DAI liquidity requirement for participants
- Uses a four-stage circuit breaker built into the Clipper contract.
- The auction initiation function takes caller supplied arguments.
- Incentives may be used as a remedy to this potential issue and possibly a way for
  the protocol to keep ilk.dust lower.
- Governance must take care when increasing the ilk's dust, tip, or chip not to incentivize
  the creation of many Vaults to farm this incentive.
- Integrators should take into account how sudden changes in parameters would impact
  their bidding strategies.
- The System Stabilizer Module's purpose is to correct the system when the value of
  the collateral backing Dai drops below the liquidation level.
- The system stabilizer module creates incentives for Auction Keepers to step in and
  drive the system back to a safe state.
- The OSM has a 1-hour price delay.
- The Median maintains a whitelist of price feed contracts.
- The MKR token is an ERC-20 token created using DSToken. A key difference to note
  between Dai and most other popular ERC20 tokens is that both these fields use bytes32
  instead of the string type.
- The spell is only marked as 'done' if the CALL it makes succeeds.
- MKR users moving their votes from one spell to another presents a potential failure
  mode.
- Accumulation must be a constant-time operation with respect to the number of Vaults
  and DSR deposits.
- DSR Manager allows service providers to deposit/withdraw dai with one function call.
- CDP Manager enables a formalized process for Vaults to be transferred between owners.
- Vote Proxy facilitates online voting with offline MKR storage.
- DssProxyActions serves as a library for user's ds-proxies.
- Allows users to execute a flash mint of Dai with the condition that it is paid back
  in the same transaction with a fee.
- Shutdown stops and gracefully settles the Maker Protocol while ensuring that all
  users, both Dai holders and Vault holders, receive the net value of assets they
  are entitled to.
- Only authorized users can update any variables in contract
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- This project uses Python 3.6.6.
- Auctions are executed on-chain, minimizing required transactions and reducing fees.
- The cage-keeper directly interacts with the End, Flopper and Flapper contracts.
- The keeper's Ethereum address should have enough ETH to cover gas costs.
- This keeper is run continuously, and saves a local database of yays (spell addresses)
  and an yay:eta dictionary to reduce chain state reads.
- Issues with MacOS Mojave
- Mcd is built on Seth and uses the same network configuration options.
- The only required configuration parameter is the -C, --chain=<chain> option and
  -F, --from=<address> sender account.
- This API requires installation of seth to interface with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Gas costs may be slightly increased when dealing with proxy contracts.
- Users need to install seth to interface with the Ethereum blockchain.
- The user must setup contract addresses for interaction.
- If triggering the ESM is not successful, ensure gas is set at an appropriate level
- The triggering of the ESM is not to be taken lightly; for a full explanation of
  the implications please review the below documentation.
- The Migration contract allows moving SAI and CDPs from the SCD system to the MCD
  system, thus becoming DAI and Vaults.
- Users and partners must migrate their existing Single Collateral Dai tokens (Sai)
  to Multi Collateral Dai tokens (Dai) and CDPs to the new system.
- 'On November 18: Rename Single-Collateral Dai to ''Sai''.'
- Select a future date between November 18-25 to execute the upgrade to MCD.
- The migration app can only be used for CDPs created through a Maker proxy contract.
- If CDPs were created using third party services that do not use Maker proxies, manual
  migration is required.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in MakerDAO
- Some responses may include nulls for optional data
- Auctions are executed on-chain, minimizing the number of required transactions and
  reducing associated fees.
- Auction Keepers directly interact with Flipper, Flapper and Flopper auction contracts
  deployed to the Ethereum mainnet.
- Auction Keepers will automatically call `deal` if the Keeper's address won the auction.
- The Kovan version runs on the Kovan Release 1.0.2.
- A separate keeper must be configured for flip of each collateral type, as well as
  for flap and flop.
- If an auction starts before the auction Keeper has started, the Keeper will not
  participate in the auction until the next block has been mined.
- Keepers do not explicitly handle global settlement (`End`). If global settlement
  occurs while a winning bid is outstanding, the Keeper will not request a `yank`
  to refund the bid.
- There are some Keeper functions that incur gas fees regardless of whether a bid
  is submitted.
- The Keeper will not check model prices until an auction officially exists. As such,
  it will `kick`, `flap`, or `flop` in response to opportunities regardless of whether
  or not your DAI or MKR balance is sufficient to participate.
