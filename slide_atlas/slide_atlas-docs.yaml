auth_info:
- information_source; https://images.slide-atlas.org/api/v1:
  - AWS S3 authentication for assetstore requires either explicit credentials or credential
    inference. Explicit authentication uses accessKeyId and secret query parameters;
    alternatively, inferCredentials can be set to true to have Boto infer credentials
    automatically, which ignores the accessKeyId and secret parameters. Additional
    S3 configuration includes region, service endpoint, and optional server-side encryption
    flag.
  - Must be a system administrator to call this endpoint. The API enforces role-based
    access control where a 403 Forbidden response is returned if the caller is not
    a system administrator. No explicit credential headers or tokens are mentioned;
    authorization is determined by the caller's system administrator role status.
  - Pass your username and password using HTTP Basic Auth. The server sends a cookie
    in the response that should be included in subsequent requests. An optional Girder-OTP
    header can be provided as a one-time password for the user.
  - The API uses a Girder-OTP header for one-time password authentication. Pass the
    one-time password value in the Girder-OTP request header when finalizing OTP enablement
    for a user.
  - The API uses token-based authentication with session management. Tokens can be
    obtained via the /token/session endpoint (anonymous or logged-in), listed via
    /token/listScopes to view available scopes, and deleted via DELETE /token/session
    to remove authentication. Tokens appear to be passed as cookies or in Authorization
    headers, though exact header/parameter names are not specified in this documentation
    excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://images.slide-atlas.org/api/v1:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer) to set result set size and offset
    (query parameter, integer) to specify the starting position in the result set.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer, result set size limit) and offset
    (query parameter, integer, offset into result set) to control pagination. The
    response structure for pagination fields is not documented in this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit controls the result set
    size and offset specifies the position in the result set to start from. Both are
    optional integers.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the starting position in the result set, and limit controls how many results are
    returned per request. No response fields indicating total count, next page, or
    stopping conditions are documented.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: limit (query, integer, result set size)
    and offset (query, integer, offset into result set). Response structure not detailed,
    but use offset value from current response to construct next request by incrementing
    it.'
