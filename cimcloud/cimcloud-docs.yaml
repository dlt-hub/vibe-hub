auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.cimcloud.com/help-center/api-framework-authentication/:
  - The API supports two authentication types. Default (JWT Bearer) requires sending
    a POST request to https://api.cimcloud.com/{sitename}/authenticate with a JSON
    body containing AuthKey, AuthUserName, and AuthPassword fields. The response includes
    a token that expires after 7 days and must be passed as a Bearer Token in the
    Authorization header for each subsequent request (except the Canary Endpoint).
    The response also includes a refresh_token for token refresh. Alternatively, Basic
    Authentication allows passing Authorization Username and Password directly with
    each API request.
  - The API uses JWT Bearer token authentication obtained via a session-based login
    flow. To authenticate, POST to https://api.cimcloud.com/{sitename}/authenticate
    with AuthKey, AuthUserName, AuthPassword, and SessionUsername in the request body;
    the response includes a JWT token, session key, refresh_token, and expiration
    date. Use the returned token as a Bearer token in subsequent requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.cimcloud.com/help-center/api-framework-get-requests-pagination/:
  - The API uses path-based pagination with a page_number parameter appended to the
    endpoint URL. The default returns 50 results per page. The page_number starts
    at 1, with empty or 0 values treated as the first page. The searchstring parameter
    is optional and can be included before the page_number in the path.
