  - 'The `/api/cache` endpoint requires an API key passed in the `X-API-KEY` header.
    The API key value is configured in the application.properties file. Send a DELETE
    request to `http://localhost:8080/api/cache` with the header `X-API-KEY: my-secret-api-key-value`
    where the value matches your configured key.'
- ? information_source; https://docs.cbioportal.org/deployment/authorization-and-authentication/authenticating-users-via-tokens/
  : - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
      the format "Bearer <token>" in all requests. Tokens have configurable expiration
      periods (e.g., 30 or 300 days) and per-user limits. Missing or invalid tokens
      return HTTP 401.
    - 'Data access tokens are obtained by logging into cBioPortal and downloading
      from the "Data Access Token" menu option. The token is then presented with each
      web service request using the Authorization header with Bearer scheme. Include
      the token in requests as: Authorization: Bearer <token_value>. For uuid and
      jwt token methods, tokens include creation_date and expiration_date fields that
      must be managed by the client.'
- ? information_source; https://docs.cbioportal.org/deployment/authorization-and-authentication/keycloak-api-access-and-user-creation/
  : - Keycloak OpenID Connect OAuth2 authentication is used. To obtain an access token,
      send a POST request to https://<KEYCLOAK_HOST>/auth/realms/<REALM>/protocol/openid-connect/token
      with Content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded body containing client_id,
      client_secret, and grant_type parameters. Then include the returned access token
      in the Authorization header as Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN} for subsequent API requests.
      Access tokens expire after 300 seconds by default.
    - Keycloak uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for API authentication. Obtain
      a ClientId and Secret from the realm-management client credentials tab, then
      exchange them for an access token by posting client_id, client_secret, and grant_type=client_credentials
      as x-www-form-urlencoded data to the Keycloak token endpoint, and include the
      resulting access token in subsequent API requests.
