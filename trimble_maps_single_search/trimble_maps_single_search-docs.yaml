auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.trimblemaps.com/restful-apis/account-manager/account-manager-api/:
  - 'Authenticate using an API key provided by Trimble. Send a POST request with the
    apiKey in the JSON body. The server responds with a JWT token that must be included
    in all subsequent requests using the Authorization header in the format "Authorization:
    bearer {token}".'
  - Authenticate your account by requesting a token and pass it as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header for each subsequent request. The alias parameter is
    optional when authenticating for your own fleet but required when Trimble Maps
    partners authenticate on behalf of their customers.
  - 'Authentication uses JSON Web Token (JWT) passed in the Authorization header.
    The required header parameter is authorizationToken, sent as "Authorization: bearer
    {token}" where {token} is the JWT generated during authentication.'
  - 'Authentication uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Include the token in the Authorization
    header as a bearer token with the format "Authorization: bearer {token}", where
    {token} is the JWT generated during authentication. The authorizationToken header
    parameter is required for all requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) passed as a bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The required header is `Authorization: bearer {token}`, where the token
    is generated during authentication. To obtain a product ID for license assignment,
    first authenticate and make a GET request to `https://accounts-api.trimblemaps.com/api/v1/summary`.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.trimblemaps.com/restful-apis/account-manager/account-manager-api/:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes offset,
    limit, size fields, and href links for first, next, and last pages to navigate
    results.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offSet (default 0) specifies
    items to skip, and limit (default 20) specifies items to return per request. Stop
    paginating when returned items are fewer than the limit value.
  - Use offset (integer, default 0) and limit (integer, default 20) query parameters
    to paginate results. offset specifies items to skip, limit specifies items to
    return per request. Continue requesting with incremented offset values until fewer
    than limit items are returned.
- information_source; https://developer.trimblemaps.com/restful-apis/route-reporter/routereporter-api/:
  - The `/trips` endpoint uses offset-based pagination with `pageNumber` as a required
    query parameter (first page is 1). Up to 100 trips are returned per call; use
    `pageNumber` to retrieve additional pages when an `externalTripId` has more than
    100 trips.
  - Use `pageNumber` as a query parameter to paginate through results. The exact pagination
    response structure is not documented in the provided text, so the stopping condition
    and response fields indicating pagination state cannot be determined.
