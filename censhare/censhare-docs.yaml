auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.censhare.com/online-solutions/hcms-rest-endpoints:
  - 'The Cookies API endpoint /auth/cookie/set accepts authorization cookies via query
    parameters (GET) or request body (POST) in application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    format. For JWT auth provider, if no cookie is configured, behavior depends on
    API version: v4.3+ treats cookies as disabled, while v4.2 and lower use a default
    cookie name. The endpoint returns 204 No Content and sets appropriate authorization
    cookies for configured auth providers.'
- information_source; https://documentation.censhare.com/online-solutions/hcms-server-module:
  - Server authentication can be enabled by setting `server-auth="true"` on the `config`
    element in the configuration XML. When enabled, standard Server REST API authentication
    (HTTP Basic or JWT token from Keycloak) is required before requests reach HCMS.
    Authentication failures return standard Server responses (HTML) rather than HCMS
    JSON errors. User identity is provided via standard query variables/logger values
    and the `/auth/whoami` endpoint. Asset permissions are evaluated based on the
    authenticated user's domains and roles, and assets outside the user's domain are
    not visible. HCMS authentication can still be configured to run in addition to
    Server authentication, though this is rarely useful except for IP-based role grants.
- information_source; https://documentation.censhare.com/online-solutions/rest-api-overview:
  - Authorization is handled by HCMS through JWT tokens. Most middleware endpoints
    forward the JWT token received by clients directly to HCMS using the utility function
    nonPrivilegedHcms, which creates an appropriate request with the token. Different
    endpoints may handle authorization differently, but the primary mechanism is JWT
    token forwarding to HCMS for validation.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.censhare.com/online-solutions/hcms-rest-endpoints:
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with query parameters. The optional query
    parameter order specifies sorting as a comma-separated list of property names,
    optionally prefixed with minus for descending order. Results include first, last,
    and current page links, with first page at offset 0. The /query endpoint supports
    pagination and ordering identically to single-entity lists.
