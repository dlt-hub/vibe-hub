notes:
- Handoff exposes a Typescript API allowing integration into Node based applications.
- You'll need a paid Figma account to take this action.
- Handoff is Free and Open Source Software under the MIT license.
- The CLI allows you to interact with your Figma file and Handoff app via the command
  line.
- Handoff has sane configuration defaults but the various kinds of configurations
  can be tailored or extended.
- Extracting Component tokens reliably from Figma is difficult.
- Handoff focuses on extracting tokens from a well-structured Figma library.
- Handoff should fit within your existing infrastructure.
- To run the Handoff pipeline, all you need is Node 16.
- A paid Figma account is required to publish the Figma file library

  and edit text on every page.
