auth_info:
- information_source; https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckbox/latest/features/rest-api.html:
  - Authentication for the CKBox REST API requires a JWT token passed in the Authorization
    header. The token payload must include aud (audience), sub (subject user ID),
    iat (issued at timestamp), and auth.ckbox.role field set to admin for full endpoint
    access. Refer to the Authentication guide for token generation algorithms and
    examples.
  - 'Authentication uses JWT tokens signed with HS256. Create the token by signing
    a payload containing aud (environment ID), sub (user ID), and auth.ckbox.role
    with your access key, then send it in the Authorization header.


    Required credentials from Customer Portal: environment ID and access key. JWT
    payload must include aud set to environment ID, sub set to user ID, and auth object
    with ckbox.role field. Sign with HS256 algorithm using the access key. Send the
    token in the Authorization header when making requests to the API endpoint.'
  - 'JWT token-based authentication is required. The token must be sent in the Authorization
    header as a bearer token. The JWT payload must include aud (environment ID), sub
    (user ID), iat (issued-at timestamp in seconds), and auth (object with role set
    to either user or admin). Send requests to https://api.ckbox.io/ with the header
    Authorization: <jwt_token>.'
- information_source; https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-integration.html:
  - AWS credentials are required using accessKeyId and secretAccessKey fields in the
    credentials object. These are AWS access key ID and secret access key pairs used
    for authenticating requests to Amazon Bedrock services.
  - Authentication is configured via the `requestHeaders` option in `config.ai.assistant.adapter.openAI`.
    You can set `requestHeaders` to an async function that fetches a JWT token from
    your authorization endpoint and returns an object with an `Authorization` header
    set to `Bearer <jwt>`. The function receives an optional `actionId` parameter
    identifying the user action, allowing customized authorization logic on your backend.
