auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.postalytics.com/blog/multi-tenant-direct-mail-api/:
  - Postalytics API uses API key authentication. Include the API key in the X-API-Key
    header with each request. The key is referenced as CLIENT_API_KEY in examples
    and should be passed as a custom header in HTTP requests to endpoints like /api/v1/send.
  - X-API-Key header authentication is required. Send the API key in the X-API-Key
    header of the request, with the value set to your CLIENT_API_KEY. This is a simple
    key-based authentication scheme with no additional parameters or scopes.
