auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://drdroid.io/framework-diagnosis-knowledge/crewai-agentic-framework-invalid-session-token-error-encountered-during-api-requests
  : - Session tokens for the CrewAI Agentic Framework are sent as Bearer tokens in
      the Authorization header of API requests. Implement automatic token refresh
      using scheduled tasks or background services to maintain valid sessions and
      avoid INVALID_SESSION_TOKEN errors.
    - The documentation describes a session token-based authentication system for
      the CrewAI Agentic Framework. Session tokens are used for API requests and must
      be obtained through re-authentication; tokens can expire due to inactivity or
      time limits and should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or
      encrypted storage) and included in API request headers. The documentation mentions
      token refresh mechanisms but does not specify exact header names, parameter
      names, or the precise format for sending the token in requests.
- ? information_source; https://drdroid.io/framework-diagnosis-knowledge/crewai-agentic-framework-the-application-fails-to-authenticate-and-returns-an-invalid-credentials-error
  : - The CrewAI API uses basic username and password authentication sent via POST
      request to the /authenticate endpoint. Credentials are submitted as form data
      parameters username and password in the request body to https://api.crewai.com/authenticate,
      and successful authentication returns a confirmation message.
- ? information_source; https://drdroid.io/framework-diagnosis-knowledge/crewai-agentic-framework-unauthorized-access-error-encountered-when-trying-to-access-a-resource
  : - 'The documentation shows that bearer token authentication is required. Credentials
      are passed via the Authorization header in the format "Authorization: Bearer
      your_access_token". The exact access token value must be obtained and included
      in request headers to authenticate successfully.'
- ? information_source; https://drdroid.io/framework-diagnosis-knowledge/autogen-agentic-framework-encountering-authentication-errors-when-attempting-to-connect-to-the-autogen-agentic-framework
  : - The AutoGen Agentic Framework API uses Bearer token authentication. Include
      your API key in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" when making
      requests to the API endpoint.
