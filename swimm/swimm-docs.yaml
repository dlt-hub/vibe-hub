- Confluence macros are extensions to the native functionality of Confluence pages.
- The code block macro allows you to write or paste code directly into your Confluence
  pages.
- Good documentation should save more time than you spend writing it—whether your
  own or the team’s time.
- Documentation as code — documents are written in Markdown form and saved within
  the codebase.
- Automatic sync — integrates into CI to locate and automatically correct documents
  that become stale.
- Documentation in Python is an indispensable aspect of any software project.
- It not only enhances code maintainability, making it easier to navigate and understand,
  but also plays a crucial role in onboarding new developers.
