auth_info:
- information_source; https://prestodb.io/docs/0.280/develop/client-protocol.html:
  - Presto/Trino uses HTTP header-based authentication and session management. The
    client must include the X-Presto-User header to specify the session user, and
    may include X-Presto-Source, X-Presto-Catalog, and X-Presto-Schema headers for
    query context. These headers are sent with each request and may be updated based
    on response headers in subsequent requests.
  - The Presto client uses HTTP header-based authentication. The caller may set the
    header X-Presto-User to specify the username for the session. Response headers
    from the initial POST to /v1/statement should be treated like browser cookies
    and echoed back as request headers in subsequent client requests to maintain session
    state.
- information_source; https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html:
  - Nessie catalog authentication supports multiple schemes configured via `iceberg.nessie.auth.type`.
    Credentials can be provided as username/password via `iceberg.nessie.auth.username`
    and `iceberg.nessie.auth.password`, or as a token via `iceberg.nessie.auth.token`.
    The Nessie API endpoint is specified with `iceberg.nessie.uri`.
- information_source; https://prestodb.io/docs/current/develop/client-protocol.html:
  - The Presto client protocol requires setting the `X-Presto-User` header to specify
    the username for the session when making POST requests to `/v1/statement`. Response
    headers should be echoed back as request headers in subsequent requests, similar
    to browser cookies.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://prestodb.io/docs/0.280/develop/client-protocol.html:
  - Pagination uses a `nextUri` field in the JSON response. If `nextUri` is present,
    execute a GET request to that URI to fetch the next batch of results. Continue
    looping GET requests to successive `nextUri` values until the field is absent,
    indicating query completion. A DELETE to `nextUri` terminates the query.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach via the `nextUri` field in the `QueryResults`
    response object. The client should execute GET requests to the `nextUri` URL returned
    in each response and continue looping until `nextUri` is absent, indicating no
    more results.
  - Use POST to /v1/statement with query in body to start; response includes nextUri
    field for fetching subsequent result batches via GET requests to that URI.
- information_source; https://prestodb.io/docs/current/develop/client-protocol.html:
  - A GET request to the `nextUri` attribute in the QueryResults response returns
    the next batch of query results. A DELETE request to `nextUri` terminates the
    running query. Continue paginating until `nextUri` is absent from the response.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with the `nextUri` field. After a POST
    to `/v1/statement`, if the response contains a `nextUri` link, the client should
    execute a GET request to that URI and repeat until `nextUri` is absent from the
    response, indicating query completion.
