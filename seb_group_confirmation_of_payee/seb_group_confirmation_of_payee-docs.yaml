auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sebgroup.com/products/cop-uk-account-assurance/confirmation-of-payee:
  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication is required. Clients must present either a PSD2
    certificate, SEB issued certificate, or test certificate in the TLS handshake.
    Additionally, an API key must be provided, likely as a header or query parameter,
    along with client credentials (client ID and client secret) for token-based access.
  - This API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for authentication. In sandbox,
    use client ID g47y0wEEU0thHaMpwu8j and client secret fPL0ITDjGcjr5O8jY8c8 with
    token endpoint https://api-sandbox.sebgroup.com/mga/sps/oauth/oauth20/token. In
    production, use https://s2s-api.sebgroup.com/mga/sps/oauth/oauth20/token and request
    credentials via the Apps section. Additionally, an SEB-issued client certificate
    is required for production (test certificate for sandbox, available on GitHub).
    Send grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret as POST body
    parameters to obtain the access token.
