notes:
- Software installed in pipx's managed virtual environments can get stale.
- When we have a virtual environment for a project and we run pip upgrade, it just
  upgrades the package we request.
- At work, when our usage and revenue reporting pipelines fail, they usually fail
  because of tiny data.
- When the generated reports with $ 0 amounts of advertising revenue hit our validators
  they fail for the partners whose reports contain enough detail to see that revenue
  and currency information.
- After this incident, I’m left wondering if it’s OK that our pipeline is halted by
  a missing row worth less than a penny that wouldn’t affect monthly payouts.
- The failure is a gift in disguise - it’s helped us to see a flaw in the pipeline
  that’s so often hidden by aggregation.
- Some personal private packages are harder to get into pipx, depending on proper
  packaging.
- The installation of private packages from private repositories may require manual
  cloning.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Each factory should reliably generate 10 valid instances of each model.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some builds may receive false negatives and positives.
- It's important to ensure builds are stable and reliable before client sign off.
- Some small updates to the django-mailchimp library to upgrade to the latest Mailchimp
  API.
- Upgrading 'Is Easy ™️'.
- Some packages may not upgrade due to pinned dependencies.
- Validation errors in the pipeline can halt monthly production.
- GitHub API has rate limits that may affect performance.
- Requires proper OAuth setup for seamless integration.
- The account_members fixture returns a tuple of users.
- The code used to test the factory libraries is available in the Factory Audit repository.
- Updated documentation includes a new tutorial - but images are already out of date!
- Uses pipx to manage Python tools
- Eager option upgrades all dependencies regardless of whether they still satisfy
  the new parent requirements
- This is good
- 'On the good side, we could say: All the main sources of error are stable, it’s
  just the tiny edge cases that are failing.'
- In addition, these failures are so rare that we often are surprised when things
  fail. Plus, it’s good that we have the validation in place that finds these kind
  of errors and reports them.
- 'On the other hand, we could say: The pipelines are so fragile that a tiny missing
  piece of revenue allocated to a user in a territory can bring down a monthly reporting
  run.'
- There also seems some truth in this.
- What I realised is that the failure is a gift in disguise - it’s helped us to see
  a flaw in the pipeline that’s so often hidden by aggregation.
- Uses pipx to install and manage Python packages easily
- Pytest prevents its cache directory .pytest_cache from getting into Git repositories
  by adding a .gitignore file inside them.
- Make sure you 'Sign up for the beta' of migration in your Travis dot org account.
- If you have required checks in the branch protection rules of your GitHub project
  repository, these need to be switched over.
- Travis CI may hit API rate limits for GitHub calls
- Retry actions if API calls fail
- The dedicated library repository now means that when I’ve had questions about how
  Sync Gateway behaves in certain situations, then the library is the place to explore
  that behaviour and ensure that the library code is fulfilling its main responsibility
  - communicating as best it can with any Sync Gateway instance.
- Uses pytest fixtures for testing.
- Tests should adhere to the AAA pattern.
- Uses Makefile for managing requirements
- Keep requirements files sorted alphabetically
- Factory Djoy provides certainty of calling full_clean for every created instance.
- The grading system for factories may not reflect their actual usability.
- Keep tests as tight as possible.
- Do not use assertTrue or assertFalse unless you really have to.
- A newer version of this post exists with an assertion helper for Python 3 and pytest.
- When a suite has complicated assertions to test regularly, create an assertion helper.
- The Cup class represents a cup in the problem with capacity and contents.
- The Game class represents a single state in the tree with properties cups, parent,
  and children.
- Builds have received false positives. They have passed when they shouldn’t have.
- Scarce documentation. It’s not very clear how to work with teams, amongst other
  topics.
- This basic list can start a journey of specification exploration.
- Uses a checklist for aspects that might be missing from flat web designs.
- Hanging commits are removed from the local repository by garbage collection.
- Url formats have changed - now need quotes
- No ALLOWED_HOSTS makes 500s
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'False negative: Build failed when it shouldn''t have.'
- 'False positive: Build passed when it shouldn''t have.'
- Package is uninstalled, then installed with pipx install PACKAGE.
- '403 Forbidden: Check your access level or token permissions.'
- '404 Not Found: Ensure the endpoint and parameters are correct.'
