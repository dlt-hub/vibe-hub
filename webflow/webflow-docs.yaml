notes:
- You must protect all Personal Information using reasonable and appropriate technical
  and organizational measures.
- You are required to maintain a privacy policy for your Application.
- Webflow Apps must run on HTTPS URLs, and Ngrok provides a secure tunnel for your
  local server.
- Webhooks created through the dashboard will not include the request headers needed
  to validate request signatures.
- Two-factor authentication is enabled for an admin account on the workspace
- Your app must meet all technical requirements to be made publicly available
- API tokens expire after 365 consecutive days of inactivity.
- Each site can have up to 5 tokens.
- On July 7, 2025, we’re releasing important updates to how CMS items are published
  and managed via the API.
- Updating an item’s isDraft property to true on a live item will no longer unpublish
  it.
- Test your integrations using the beta API endpoints.
- Designer APIs only access content on the current page, not other sites or pages.
- Only Workspace admins can upload new bundles. If you’re not an admin, contact your
  Workspace administrator to upload the bundle or grant you the necessary permissions.
- Available scopes are determined by the type of token you’re creating.
- Each API endpoint lists its required scopes in the description.
- Only request scopes your app actually needs.
- Only Workspace admins can create apps, view client secrets, upload bundles, and
  modify app settings.
- Never commit your Client Secret to version control
- Rotate your Client Secret if it’s ever exposed
- Store secrets in environment variables or a secure secret management system
- Implement proper CORS policies for Designer Extensions
- Files you upload to the assets panel aren’t restricted — that is, they’re publicly
  available and discoverable.
- When uploading a file, Webflow requires an MD5 hash generated from the contents
  of the file to ensure data integrity.
- Uses llms.txt standard for AI developer tools
- Documentation accessible via markdown versions
- If you exceed your rate limit, Webflow’s API will return an HTTP `429` Too Many
  Requests error.
- The `Retry-After` header will tell you how long to wait before attempting new requests—typically,
  this reset time is 60 seconds.
- Site Publish operations are limited to one successful publish per minute.
- Rate limits are applied on a per API key basis.
- Webflow provides three key HTTP response headers with every API request to help
  monitor and manage your API usage.
- Ensure you have the correct OAuth scopes set up for your application.
- Permission from Webflow, Inc. is required to use the Webflow name or logo as part
  of any project, product, service, domain name, or company name.
- Domain names containing 'Webflow' are restricted to officially recognized Webflow
  communities only.
- As of Sep 22, 2023, we only support writing to Text and Rich Text to the DOM. We
  do not support updating images via this API.
errors:
- 'Non-200 HTTP status code response: If we receive any response other than a valid
  HTTP 200 response, it is regarded as a failure.'
- 'Redirects: If the webhook encounters redirects while attempting to deliver the
  payload, it will be treated as a failure.'
- 'SSL Certificate Issues: If we cannot successfully negotiate or validate your server’s
  SSL certificate, it will be marked as a failure.'
- 'Timeouts: Webflow expects a swift response during webhook delivery. If there are
  prolonged delays in receiving a response from your server, it will be considered
  a failure.'
- '429 Too Many Requests: Handle retries effectively and respect the `Retry-After`
  header.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your credentials and token expiration.'
- '404 Not Found: Verify the endpoint and resource identifiers.'
