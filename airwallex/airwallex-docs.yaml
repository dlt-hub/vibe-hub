auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api:
  - Airwallex uses API key and Client ID authentication for standard requests, sent
    via the login endpoint at POST /api/v1/authentication/login. For embedded components,
    use POST /api/v1/authentication/authorize. OAuth2 is also supported via the authorization
    code grant type with PKCE extension for third-party resource access. All requests
    must use HTTPS with PCI-DSS recommended TLS versions and cipher suites. API keys
    and Client IDs are managed in the Airwallex Webapp and must not be shared publicly.
  - 'Airwallex uses OAuth 2.0 for API authentication. Obtain an access token by exchanging
    an authorization_code or refresh_token at the POST /oauth/token endpoint using
    your client_id and client_secret (issued upon application registration). Include
    the access token in the Authorization header of all API requests as "Authorization:
    Bearer <access token>". API access is restricted to scopes specified during the
    authorization request. Register your application by contacting strategic-partnerships@airwallex.com
    to receive client credentials.'
  - Airwallex uses a custom header-based authentication scheme. To authenticate, send
    a POST request to the Authentication API endpoint with your Client ID and API
    key in the request headers as x-client-id and x-api-key respectively. On success,
    the response contains a token field with a JWT access token that can be used for
    subsequent API calls.
  - 'Partner Connections API requires bearer token authentication obtained from the
    partner login endpoint. Include the access token in the Authorization header as
    `Authorization: Bearer [access_token]` for all API requests to the Partner Connections
    API endpoints.'
  - To begin you will need to obtain an access token using your unique Client ID and
    API key found in the API menu in the Airwallex Web Application. Call the Authentication
    API endpoint with these credentials to receive an access token, which is then
    used to reach all other API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api:
  - Pagination for GET /api/v1/global_accounts uses page parameter (replacing page_num)
    in request payload. Response includes page_before and page_after fields (replacing
    has_more) to indicate available pages for navigation.
  - Pagination for GET /api/v1/transfers uses page parameter in request payload instead
    of page_num, and response includes page_before and page_after fields instead of
    has_more to indicate pagination state.
  - 'Pagination parameters renamed on GET /api/v1/account_capabilities/funding_limits:
    `pageNum` changed to `page_num` and `pageSize` changed to `page_size` (request
    only). Billing search endpoints GET /api/v1/billing_customers and GET /api/v1/billing_transactions
    have pagination updates for both request and response, but specific parameter
    and field names are not detailed in this excerpt.'
  - Pagination request parameter changed from `page_num` to `page` in request payload.
    Response pagination fields changed from `has_more` to `page_before` and `page_after`.
    These changes apply to all listed GET endpoints and are available generally from
    this API version onward.
  - This API supports keyset pagination using the `page_after` parameter. If the response
    includes additional pages, the `has_more` field will be set to `true`. Use the
    value of `page_after` from the response as the `page_after` parameter in the next
    request; stop paginating when `has_more` is `false`.
