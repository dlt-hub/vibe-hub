notes:
- If you have multiple rows of JSON and the data is not fully expanding as expecting,
  review the JSON body in the top row of your data.
- This integration is currently in beta.
- Use Production Keys to connect to live production data in Parabola.
- ShipStation is a beta integration which requires a slightly more involved setup
  process than our native integrations.
- This integration is currently in beta— additional functionality is available via
  API.
- Rate limits protect the DHL infrastructure from suspicious requests that exceed
  defined thresholds.
- Ensure the user/role configured for the integration has sufficient permissions to
  access all necessary saved searches and results
- By default, we pull in 20 pages of data (2,000 records).
- Parabola supports working with messy, unstructured data.
- AI steps help automate processes and extract structured data.
- Webflow APIs use Offset & Limit pagination - set both the offset and the limit to
  100.
- Twilio will charge you according to your account per message.
- Twilio has a rate limit on sending messages. They will only send as fast as one
  per second, or 60 per minute.
- Pagination for Advanced Filter Endpoints uses Offset and Limit style.
- You need to encode your Client ID and Client Secret separated by a colon.
- We do not sell your personal information.
- If you do not provide information indicated as required or mandatory within the
  Service, or that is otherwise necessary to provide a requested service or feature
  within the Service, that portion or all of the Service may be unavailable to you
  and we may deactivate your account.
- The Pull from API step cannot extract dynamic ranges, such as date.
- Parabola will never limit API calls according to a user’s plan—rate limiting is
  at the discretion of the user, and may be restricted natively by the API.
- Spotify requires you to base64 encode your client_id and client_secret.
- 'You''ll be asked to provide a ''redirect URL.'' You can supply the following URL:
  https://parabola.io/api/steps/generic_api/callback'
- API key should be passed as a Bearer Token in all API requests.
- The user will need to have User or Admin permissions in Looker in order to be able
  to find Looks and run them.
- Parabola cannot support the API’s cursor-style pagination at this time.
- Configuring a smaller, dynamic date range with frequent Flow runs is highly recommended.
- Step cannot create or remove tables within Snowflake. A database table must already
  exist in Snowflake.
errors:
- 250 calls per day with a maximum of 1 call every 5 seconds.
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '404: The Look may not exist in the Production environment and needs to be pushed
  to production.'
- '404: The authenticated user may not have the right permissions to run the Look
  and needs to get access in Looker.'
