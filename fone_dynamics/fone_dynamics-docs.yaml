auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.fonedynamics.com/docs/rest-api/:
  - All requests to the Fone Dynamics REST API require authentication. The API uses
    API key authentication sent via the Authorization header. Include your API key
    in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" for each request.
    Requests without valid authentication will be rejected.
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded credentials sent in the
    Authorization header. Use either Account SID as username with Account Token as
    password for full access, or Property SID as username with Project API Token as
    password for project-level access only.


    Authorization header format: Authorization: BASIC {TOKEN} where {TOKEN} is base64-encoded
    "username:password". The username is either your Account SID or Property SID,
    and the password is either your Account Token or Project API Token respectively.
    Obtain credentials by contacting support or logging into the platform with integrations
    permission enabled. HTTPS is required; non-SSL requests are rejected.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.fonedynamics.com/docs/rest-api/get-calls/:
  - Pagination uses a Token parameter (server-side pointer) passed as an optional
    query parameter to retrieve subsequent pages of call results. The Token value
    from a previous response should be included in the next request to continue pagination.
- information_source; https://www.fonedynamics.com/docs/rest-api/get-numbers/:
  - 'The API supports pagination for list requests via optional query parameters:
    Results_Count (integer, specifies number of results to return) and Results_Skip
    (integer, specifies number of results to skip). The maximum number of results
    returned from a single request is 200.'
