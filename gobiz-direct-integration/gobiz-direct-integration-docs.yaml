- Uses OAuth2 with client credentials — suitable for machine to machine authorization.
- No. Once you have integrated your POS with our GoBiz API, all orders will flow directly
  to your POS system.
- Due to the nature of the internet network, there is no guarantee that the event
  will only be sent exactly once.
- Due to the nature of the internet network, there is no guarantee that the event
  will only be sent exactly once (e.g retry due to intermittent network). Thus, there
  might be event duplication, and receiving end needs to be able to handle the duplication.
