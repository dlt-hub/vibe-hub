notes:
- OAuth 2.0 for Microsoft 365 Email and Azure Dev Ops Connectors
- Use ASM
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Should ASM be added to the antivirus exclusion list? Yes, exclude the ASM Core virtual
  directory and install location from antivirus scans and real-time monitoring.
- Do not make configuration changes in Production.
- Always back up the target environment before making changes.
- The following legacy features, modules, and capabilities are in a state of limited
  or no support, or are receiving no current or future planned development effort.
- ASM Core provides a common Integration Platform to set up various types of integration
  with external applications.
- Connectors are .NET Assemblies designed to expose data through code.
- Authorization service – allows you to login and provides a token to use for all
  subsequent API calls
- The Refresh Token allocates a ASM Core Session and consumes a licence.
- The API supports flexible paging of search results.
- VIEW_NAME must be unique
- RELATED_ENTITY_ID must be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 to disable the (otherwise
  mandatory) join on a primary relation
- ASM can facilitate the transfer of information for the resolution of calls or the
  completion of tasks.
- The platform defines a minimal set of connector interfaces that provide the basic
  services required by each integration.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- Data corruption can occur if source and targets are not synced.
- Importing in the wrong sequence can cause workflows to malfunction.
- '401: invalid_client: The client_id is incorrect or the client is not enabled'
- '400: invalid_grant: The credentials are not correct, the user is not allowed to
  login'
