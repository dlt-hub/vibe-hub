notes:
- Pagination allows efficient data retrieval from APIs with large datasets.
- 'Use a Common Naming Convention for Pagination Parameters: Adopt a consistent naming
  convention for pagination parameters, such as "offset" and "limit" or "page" and
  "size."'
- 'Always include Pagination Metadata in API Responses: Provide metadata in the API
  responses to convey additional information about the pagination.'
- 'Determine an Appropriate Page Size: Select an optimal page size that balances the
  amount of data returned per page.'
- 'Implement Sorting and Filtering Options: Provide sorting and filtering parameters
  to allow API consumers to specify the order and subset of data they require.'
- 'Preserve Pagination Stability: Ensure that the pagination remains stable and consistent
  between requests.'
- 'Handle Edge Cases and Error Conditions: Account for edge cases such as reaching
  the end of the dataset, handling invalid or out-of-range page requests, and gracefully
  handling errors.'
- 'Consider Caching Strategies: Implement caching mechanisms to store paginated data
  or metadata that does not frequently change.'
- In fact, the original S3 auth does allow for the content to be signed, albeit with
  a weak MD5 signature.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- To ask a question or participate in discussions, you'll need to authenticate first.
- API pagination is crucial for efficient data retrieval and handling large datasets
- Ensure pagination remains stable and consistent between requests
- Implement caching mechanisms to store paginated data or metadata that does not frequently
  change.
- Caching can help improve performance by reducing the load on the server and reducing
  the response time for subsequent requests.
- Use page sizes that provide ample information but don’t compromise on performance.
- Don’t use pagination for certain endpoints.
- Share details on how to use pagination in your documentation.
- Test for edge cases.
- Research the different pagination options to pinpoint the best one for your needs.
- Use parameters to only retrieve the data you need, quickly.
- Leverage pagination metadata.
- Prevent cursors or session tokens from expiring.
- APIs that use cursor or keyset-based pagination will provide a cursor or field value.
