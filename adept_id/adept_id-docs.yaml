notes:
- This is a synchronous endpoint with a latency of multiple seconds in some scenarios.
- The job posting must be in the format of a standard 'base64' encoding as defined
  in RFC 4648 Section 4.
- AdeptID recommends always compressing inbound payloads. The default inbound payload
  is limited to 20MB.
- This endpoint is in private beta, docs can be shared upon request.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Page Not Found
- AdeptID recommends always compressing inbound payloads.
- The default inbound payload is limited to 20MB.
- Feedback Collection can be used to collect and share user feedback on the results
  of this endpoint.
- In rare cases, the returned evaluation may not list any skill overlaps or gaps in
  the skills report.
- 'Empty Skills Report: In rare cases, the returned evaluation may not list any skill
  overlaps or gaps in the skills report.'
- If both are populated within an object, start_date cannot be after end_date.
- Enabling this service requires contacting your AdeptID Partner Success team.
- The match-narrative endpoint is intended to be called asynchronously.
- Some fields are sparsely populated in job postings. Filtering on these fields can
  dramatically reduce the number of results returned to job seekers.
- Approximately half of job postings in third-party job feeds do not specify an education
  level.
- Jobs not specifying a salary are excluded if salary filters are specified.
- Shift hours are not available in third party job feeds.
- Searching based on shift hours may result in sparse results.
- This endpoint takes ONET occupation codes as inputs.
- This endpoint uses the ONET 2019 Simplified taxonomy.
- Appended Additional Data can be used to append additional information such as typical
  salaries to the results.
- This is a value-added service and is not available by default. To access this service,
  please contact your AdeptID Partner Success team.
- Program names must be configured with AdeptID prior to using this endpoint.
- Payload can be sent in compressed format (e.g., using GZIP).
- Maximum file size of 15 MB.
- If a location is not entered, the results returned are national.
- To access this service and attain a job_feed_id, please contact your AdeptID Partner
  Success team.
- The typical end user (reporter) experience involves adding a feedback 'call to action',
  such as a like/dislike icon for each match or recommendation in the UI.
- When using an asynchronous AdeptID endpoint, callers will receive an immediate response
  containing a result_set_id and a result_set_link.
- 'Initially, while processing of the original request is still ongoing, the response
  will read ''state'': ''pending''.'
- 'When processing has completed, the response will read ''state'': ''done'' and contain
  a file_url to download a compressed JSON file.'
- 'Enabling this service: This is a value-added service and is not available by default.
  To access this service, please contact your AdeptID Partner Success team.'
- This is a value-added service and is not available by default.
- Candidates are successfully translated in >99.99% of attempts.
- The default occupation taxonomy used for outputs of this endpoint is ONET 2019 Simplified.
- The occupation_match_confidence_min parameter can be used to exclude weak matches.
- The URL for this request expired after 30 days.
- Accepts metadata relating to a specific match operation and user provided feedback.
- 'When processing has completed, the response will read ''state'': ''done'' and contain
  a file_url.'
- This is a synchronous endpoint with a latency of multiple seconds in some scenarios.
  Users should consider this when configuring API timeout limits.
