- If you have a question about a Stack Exchange site, the best place to ask is on
  Meta Stack Exchange.
- 'You might find these links useful: Facebook Help Center, Yahoo! Help Central, Google
  Contact, Ubuntu Contact.'
- Moderators are elected by the community through popular vote.
- Moderators have special abilities to handle exceptional conditions.
- Reputation is entirely optional
- All users start with one reputation point, and reputation can never drop below 1
- Often moderators will provide a specific reason for declining a flag.
- If a few of your flags were declined, you may see a warning advising you to visit
  your flag history page and review them.
- Voting corrected events do not mean that you have done anything wrong.
- Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day.
- All bounties are paid for up front and non-refundable under any circumstances.
- Stack Exchange needs to abide by lawful, non-spurious, and validly signed takedown
  requests.
- Closed questions cannot be answered, but can be edited to make them eligible for
  reopening.
- If nobody has answered yet, go ahead and delete it — nobody minds.
- If your question has good answers, it's not fair to have those answers removed along
  with your question.
- Users can typically delete their own questions.

- The ban will be lifted automatically by the system when positive contributions outweigh
  poor answers.
- Answers can be deleted by their authors unless accepted.
- Moderators can delete any answer and trusted community members can vote to delete
  answers.

  with less than 10 reputation.
- Users with 10,000 reputation can view deleted posts, cast delete and undelete votes.
- All registered users can submit edits for tag wikis.
- This privilege is awarded at 3,000 reputation.

  of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms.
- When a tag synonym proposal reaches a score of 4, it is accepted and becomes active.
- Moderation privilege awarded at 2,000 reputation
- Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged; try to make the post significantly better when
  you edit, correcting all problems that you observe.
- Chat rooms are typically public and open to all. A gallery chat room allows anyone

  owner.
- Creation privilege awarded at 300 reputation
