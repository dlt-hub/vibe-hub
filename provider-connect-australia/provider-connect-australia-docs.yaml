notes:
- Public clients are not supported by PCA.
- Client systems must be registered via the register endpoint.
- PCA API tokens used for system-based authorisation are short lived (default is 5
  minutes).
- A client system may simply request a new token for each set of PCA API invocations
  that it makes without significant intervening delay.
- Before using PCA™ as a publisher or subscriber, an organisation must register, submit
  a participation agreement by an individual representative of the organisation, authorise
  a client for that organisation.
- The security requirements will not affect the healthcare provider’s ability to access
  My Health Record system.
- Mobile application developers are strongly encouraged to review the requirements
  and consider whether the security of their mobile applications could be strengthened
  through adoption of any applicable requirements.
- The _count search parameter returns the number of requested resources per page.
- Access tokens are valid for 5 minutes.
- The PCA Identity and Access Manager issues PCA API access tokens which are only
  valid for use for short time – no refresh tokens are issued.
- The last character (forward slash “/”) of the endpoint is significant.
errors:
