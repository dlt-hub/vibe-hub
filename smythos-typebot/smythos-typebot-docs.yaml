notes:
- Secure your API keys as you would passwords.
- Transmit tokens securely using HTTPS for all API requests to encrypt data in transit.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Open sourcing our labor of love stems from our deep conviction that this future
  should belong to all of humanity.
