notes:
- Every request must use the X-LDK-Instance header to enable a sticky session and
  improve API performance.
- Paging is used to limit the response size for resources that return potentially
  large collections of records.
- User-based licensing uses OAuth to enable end users to access the vendor's application
  or service using login credentials.
- Spaces and special characters may not be supported in feature names.
- Default product version is automatically populated.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- User-based licensing uses OAuth authentication to enable end users to access your
  application.
- TextEditor is a desktop application that requires a public client type and an authorization
  code grant type.
- TextEditor is integrated with Sentinel LDK Licensing API to manage licenses for
  Edit & Save and Print features.
- Unless your application already includes logic that retrieves the Sentinel Access
  token, you must bundle and configure the Sentinel LDK Authentication Runtime together
  with your protected application.
