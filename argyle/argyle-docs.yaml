auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.argyle.com/api-guide/overview:
  - All API requests require HTTP Basic Authentication using API keys created in the
    Argyle Console. Credentials must be provided as base64-encoded username:password
    in the Authorization header, where the username is the API key and the password
    is the API key secret. API key secrets are only displayed once during creation
    and should be securely stored.
- information_source; https://docs.argyle.com/api-reference/users:
  - The API returns a JWT token in the response field user_token. This token should
    be used for subsequent authenticated requests, likely sent in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. However, the documentation chunk provided does not explicitly
    specify how to send this token in requests or what the exact header name should
    be.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.argyle.com/api-reference/reports:
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter with a default value of 10 and maximum
    value of 200. The example shows limit=2 in the request URL, but no response pagination
    fields or navigation mechanism are shown in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - The List all reports endpoint supports pagination via the limit query parameter,
    which specifies the number of report objects returned per page with a default
    of 10 and maximum of 200. However, no response fields or navigation mechanisms
    (such as next, cursor, or offset parameters) are explicitly documented.
- information_source; https://docs.argyle.com/api-reference/users:
  - Pagination uses optional limit query parameter (default 10, maximum 200) to control
    number of user objects returned per page.
  - The API uses a limit query parameter (optional, default 10, maximum 200) to control
    the number of user objects returned per page. The documentation references a pagination
    overview but does not specify response fields for navigating to subsequent pages.
