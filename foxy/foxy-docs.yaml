auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.foxy.io/docs:
  - The Foxy API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. An OAuth client must be created
    to connect to the API. Refer to the Authentication guide for details on working
    with OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- information_source; https://api.foxy.io/docs/authentication/thirdparty:
  - 'Foxy API uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for authentication. To obtain
    an access token, send a POST request to https://api.foxycart.com/token with grant_type=authorization_code,
    code, and redirect_uri parameters, using HTTP Basic authentication with your client
    credentials (client_id:client_secret base64-encoded in the Authorization header).
    The response includes access_token, expires_in (seconds), token_type (Bearer),
    scope, and refresh_token. For API calls, include the access_token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}" along with the FOXY-API-VERSION: 1 header.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with Foxy Authorization Server. Client sends user
    to https://auth.foxy.io/authorize with response_type=code, client_id, scope, and
    state parameters. User approves and is redirected to your redirect_uri with a
    single-use authorization code (valid 30 seconds, one-time use) and state parameter
    in GET parameters. Exchange the code for access tokens via a subsequent request
    to obtain credentials for API access.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow with token exchange. After receiving an authorization
    code from the Foxy Authorization server, POST to the fx:token endpoint with www-form-url-encoded
    data containing grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret
    to obtain access and refresh tokens. Include FOXY-API-VERSION: 1 header. Error
    responses include access_denied, invalid_client, invalid_request, and invalid_scope
    with specific actions required for each.'
- information_source; https://api.foxy.io/docs/cheat-sheet:
  - As an authenticated OAuth Client, you can access reporting endpoints and encode
    operations by providing OAuth credentials. The specific header names, parameter
    formats, and token acquisition details are not described in this excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.foxy.io/docs/cheat-sheet:
  - 'The API uses limit-offset pagination controlled by URL parameters limit (default
    20, maximum 300) and offset. Navigation is provided via Link header rels: first,
    prev, next, and last to move between pages of results.'
- information_source; https://api.foxy.io/docs/tutorials/foxyclient:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters to control page size and position.
    Response includes returned_items, total_items, offset, and limit fields, plus
