  : - All API requests to the VMS Mediaserver require Digest Authentication. The documentation
      indicates this is the current required auth scheme, with plans for alternative
      authentication methods in future releases.
    - All requests require Digest Authentication to the VMS Mediaserver. In future
      releases, Server to Server requests will use Bearer Authentication instead.
      Digest Authentication is deprecated since version 5.0 and will be removed in
      a future release.
- information_source; https://support.networkoptix.com/hc/en-us/articles/32895719318935-Authentication-through-the-REST-API:
  - All owner-level API requests require session authentication using a fresh bearer
    token sent in the Authorization header. The token is obtained through the VMS
    Server API and must be included in requests to enforce password checks. Use the
    HTTP Authorization header with the Bearer scheme as specified in RFC 6750.
  - HTTP Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain a bearer token via a login
    request to the VMS Server, then send it in the Authorization header for all subsequent
    API requests. The setCookie parameter can be set to true for cookie-based authentication
    in web browsers. Only HTTPS or RTSPS connections are supported; raw HTTP or RTSP
    requests cannot be used.

  : - The API uses bearer token authentication via the Authorization header. After
      receiving a 307 Temporary Redirect response with a Location header, send the
      actual API request to that new location with the Authorization header containing
      the access token.
