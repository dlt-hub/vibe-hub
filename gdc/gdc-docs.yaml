auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/:
  - Authentication is required for downloading controlled-access data and data submission.
    The GDC API uses tokens obtained from the GDC Data Portal or GDC Data Submission
    Portal, which must be passed as the X-Auth-Token custom HTTP header in all authenticated
    requests.
  - Authentication uses a token-based approach where the authentication token is read
    from a file and passed in the X-Auth-Token header. The token should be included
    in all requests to the GDC API as a custom header named X-Auth-Token with the
    token string as its value.
- information_source; https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Downloading_Files/:
  - Authentication for the GDC API uses a token-based system. The token must be passed
    in the X-Auth-Token header when making requests to access controlled-access files.
    The token is typically stored in a file (e.g., gdc-token-text-file.txt) and read
    into a variable for use in curl commands or other HTTP clients.
  - Downloading controlled access data requires the use of an authentication token.
    Pass the token in the Authorization header when making requests to download controlled-access
    files from the GDC API.
  - 'The GDC API uses token-based authentication. Include the authentication token
    in the x-auth-token header when making requests to download data files.


    x-auth-token header parameter is required for authenticated requests. The token
    value should be passed as the header value (e.g., -H "x-auth-token: $token" in
    curl).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/:
  - Pagination uses `from` (starting position, default 0) and `size` (number of results
    per page) as query parameters. The response includes a `hits` array containing
    the paginated results; iterate by incrementing `from` by the `size` value until
    fewer results than `size` are returned.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: `from` (starting position, default 0),
    `size` (results per page, default 10), and `page` (current page number). Response
    includes `count` (results returned), `total` (total records), `pages` (total pages),
    and `page` (current page). To paginate, increment `from` by `size` or use `page`
    parameter; stop when all `pages` are retrieved.'
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: size (items per page, default 2), from
    (starting offset, default 0), and page (page number, default 1). Response includes
    pagination metadata fields: count (items returned), total (total items), pages
    (total pages), and sort order. To get the next page, increment the page parameter
    or adjust the from offset accordingly.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters from and size to control result offset and page
    size. Response includes pagination metadata with fields from, page, and pages
    indicating current offset, current page number, and total pages respectively.
  - Pagination uses query parameters size (default 5) and from (offset, default 0).
    Response includes pagination object with count (results returned), total (total
    results), pages (total pages), page (current page number), and size (page size).
    To paginate, increment from by size value or use page number to construct next
    request.
