notes:
- API key is required for accessing the API.
- We recommend to use the docker option for simplicity, or plain JAR if you do not
  want to install Docker.
- The size of the data being loaded (OSM data) affects memory requirements.
- Each profile can have extra info calculated, each of these requires RAM for storage.
- The most important input file is the config file.
- Openrouteservice makes use of public open-source data.
- The docker documentation is only valid for openrouteservice since v8.0.0!
- Uses Docker to run openrouteservice.
- The docker documentation is only valid for openrouteservice since v8.0.0.
- The container has to be newly created for the changes in docker-compose.yml to take
  effect.
- 'Uses an env_file: ors-config.env'
- 'Configuration file loaded: /home/ors/config/ors-config.yml'
- 'Java version required: 21.0.2 or higher'
- 'Configuration file path: /home/ors/config/ors-config.yml'
- 'OSM file used: /home/ors/files/example-heidelberg.test.pbf'
- 'Total memory: 1024 MB, Max memory: 2 GB'
- The recommended way to configure an openrouteservice instance is to use a YAML configuration
  file.
- You need to add these to the setenv.sh file in your tomcat bin folder.
- Uses default configuration ors-config.yml in the project root directory
- To use a different config file than ors-config.yml, set the environment variable
  ORS_CONFIG_LOCATION=<config> in your run config
