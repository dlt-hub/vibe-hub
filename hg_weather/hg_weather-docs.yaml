  - API key authentication is required via the `key` query parameter. For client-side
    JavaScript requests using the json-cors format, a valid API key must be provided
    and the requesting domain must be pre-registered during key creation. The key
    is passed as `key=YOUR-KEY` in the query string.
  - API key authentication is required, passed as a query parameter named `key`. Include
    your API key in the request URL as `?key=YOUR_API_KEY`.
  - The API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named `key` in requests
    to authenticate. Include `&key=YOUR_API_KEY` in the request URL to the weather
    endpoint.

  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key in the query parameter named
    `key` (e.g., `key=suachave`). The `valid_key` field in the response indicates
    whether the provided key was accepted.
  - Authentication uses an API key passed as a query parameter named "key" in the
    request URL. Replace "suachave" with your actual API key value.
