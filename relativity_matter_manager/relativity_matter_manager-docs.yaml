auth_info:
- information_source; https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/BD_Billing/Billing_Insights_API.htm:
  - The Billing Insights API uses Bearer token authentication. Generate an OAuth2
    Client, then obtain a Bearer token via the REST API authentication endpoint. Include
    the Bearer token in requests to authenticate. The associated user account must
    have permission to access Cost Explorer.
- information_source; https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/BD_Environment/Application_Install_service.htm:
  - Basic authentication is required, with credentials encoded in Base64 format and
    sent in the Authorization header. Additionally, an X-CSRF-Header (can be empty)
    and X-Kepler-Version header (set to "2.0") must be included in all requests. The
    Authorization header format is "Basic " followed by Base64-encoded "username:password"
    string.
  - Send requests with HTTP Basic authentication by adding an Authorization header
    with the value "Basic " followed by a base64-encoded username:password string.
    Also include an X-CSRF-Header header (can be empty string).
- information_source; https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/BD_Identity/User_Manager_service.htm:
  - Basic authentication is required, sent via the Authorization header as a Base64-encoded
    string of email:password. The X-Kepler-Version header with value "2.0" must also
    be included in requests.
  - The API requires two authentication mechanisms. First, HTTP Basic Authentication
    must be sent in the Authorization header using the format "Basic " followed by
    base64-encoded credentials (email:password). Second, an X-CSRF-Header must be
    included in all requests (set to "-" in the example). Additionally, the X-Kepler-Version
    header (set to "2.0") is required for API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/BD_Environment/Application_Install_service.htm:
  - 'The endpoint supports pagination via query parameters start (default: 1) and
    length (default: 10). The includeActions parameter must be set to true to populate
    pagination properties in the response, which are then used to iterate through
    pages of results.'
  - 'The endpoint supports pagination via query parameters: start (default 1, marks
    the starting position) and length (default 10, marks the number of results per
    page). The includeActions parameter must be set to true to populate pagination
    properties in the response that enable iterating through pages of results.'
- information_source; https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Legal_Hold_API/Legal_Hold_API.htm:
  - Pagination uses query parameters startingIndex (starting position, where 0 and
    1 both treated as 0) and length (maximum 1000 records per request). To paginate,
    increment startingIndex by the length value for subsequent requests; continue
    until fewer than length records are returned.
