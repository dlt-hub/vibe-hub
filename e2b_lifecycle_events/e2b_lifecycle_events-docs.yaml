auth_info:
- information_source; https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/lifecycle-events-api:
  - All requests require API key authentication passed in the X-API-Key header. The
    API key should be obtained from your E2B account and sent as the X-API-Key header
    value in each request, typically stored in the E2B_API_KEY environment variable.
  - All requests require authentication using your team API key. The API key must
    be provided to access sandbox lifecycle events and track sandbox state changes.
- information_source; https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/lifecycle-events-webhooks:
  - The API uses API key authentication. Include the X-API-Key header with your E2B_API_KEY
    value in all requests to authenticate with the E2B API.
  - Webhook requests require authentication using your team API key sent as the X-API-Key
    header. The API key is passed in the request headers with the header name X-API-Key,
    and the webhook registration also accepts an optional signatureSecret field in
    the JSON body for event signature verification.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/lifecycle-events-api:
  - Use `offset` (optional, default 0, min 0) and `limit` (optional, default 10, min
    1, max 100) query parameters to paginate events. Increment `offset` by the number
    of returned events to fetch the next page; stop when fewer events than `limit`
    are returned.
