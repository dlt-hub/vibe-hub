auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.senzthermostat.nvent.com:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication with three supported flows: Implicit, Authorization
    Code, and Hybrid. Implicit flow requires ClientID and scopes (openid, restapi)
    with tokens transmitted via browser. Authorization Code flow requires ClientID,
    ClientSecret, and scopes (openid, restapi, optionally offline_access) for back-channel
    token retrieval. Hybrid flow (recommended for native/desktop/mobile apps) requires
    ClientID, ClientSecret in back-channel requests, and scopes (openid, restapi,
    optionally offline_access for refresh tokens). The offline_access scope is optional
    but required to obtain refresh tokens in Authorization Code and Hybrid flows.'
  - OAuth2 Authorization Code flow is used to obtain access tokens from the Identity
    Server at https://id.senzthermostat.nvent.com. The access token is then used to
    authenticate requests to the RestAPI at https://api.senzthermostat.nvent.com.
    Tokens include audience, client_id, and scope claims. Access tokens can be refreshed
    using refresh tokens obtained during the initial authentication code exchange.
  - OAuth2 and OpenID Connect authentication is used for SignalR notifications in
    the same way as the RestAPI. The client must obtain an access token via OAuth2/OpenID
    Connect and pass it during SignalR connection establishment. The code example
    references oidc-client-js library for token management, with configuration requiring
    authority URL and client_id parameters.
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is used with three token types: id_token (identity information),
    access_token (bearer token, 1 hour expiration), and refresh_token (long-lived,
    15 days expiration). The implicit grant type requires ClientID and scopes (including
    openid) for browser-based applications, with tokens transmitted via the browser
    and refresh tokens not supported in this flow.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code and implicit grant flows are used. Access tokens are
    obtained during initial authentication and must be used to access protected REST
    API endpoints. Refresh tokens (with longer expiry, typically 14 days) can be exchanged
    for new access tokens to maintain indefinite access. The integrator receives both
    access and refresh tokens in the initial auth call, with expiry information included.
