auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests/:
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required via the Authorization header. The username
    is your MaxMind account ID and the password is your MaxMind license key, both
    obtainable from your MaxMind account. All requests must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2
    or greater; HTTP requests will receive a 403 Forbidden response.
  - The Authorization header is always required. Credentials must be transmitted over
    TLS 1.2 or greater; HTTP requests receive a 403 Forbidden response. HTTP requests
    over unencrypted connections are rejected to protect credential transmission.
- information_source; https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/report-a-transaction/:
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required using your MaxMind account ID as the username
    and MaxMind license key as the password. The Authorization header must follow
    standard HTTP Basic authentication format. All requests must use HTTPS with TLS
    1.2 or greater; HTTP requests will return a 403 Forbidden error. The Content-Type
    header should be set to application/json.
  - MaxMind API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an account ID and license key.
    Send credentials in the Authorization header using the format `--user account_id:license_key`
    (e.g., `--user 1:foo`). Both the account ID and license key are required; missing
    either will result in a 401 Unauthorized error.
- information_source; https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/working-with-transaction-dispositions/:
  - Authentication requires a MaxMind account ID and license key supplied together
    in the Authorization header. A 401 Unauthorized error is returned if the account
    ID is missing, and a 403 Forbidden error is returned if the account lacks permission
    to use the service.
