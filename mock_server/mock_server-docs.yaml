auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mock-server.com/mock_server/control_plane_authorisation.html:
  - Control plane requests to MockServer can be authenticated using mTLS (mutual TLS)
    or JWT. For JWT authentication, include a Bearer token in the Authorization header
    of control plane requests (create expectations, clear, reset, verify, retrieve,
    stop, etc). For mTLS, configure certificate-based authentication for TCP connections.
    Both methods can be enabled simultaneously.
