- The Forums app is used for announcements and Q&A discussions.
- Sign up and create your whop at whop.com/sell.

  with an empty metadata body to reset it.
- Many creators use Whop to accept payments and bring social features to their events.
- Use the Whop SDK’s access.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass method to determine user
  access.
- We’re still working on making Whop a better place to sell physical products.
