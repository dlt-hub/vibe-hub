notes:
- The Signed URL is valid for one hour and can be used to provide secure access to
  the tile server.
- You must ensure attribution is visible when rendering a map as part of your application.
- API Key is required for the integration to work.
- The integration may not be compatible with other third-party Adobe Commerce integrations.
- 'API Key: your API key for accessing Loqate services (this is a required field)'
- Address Capture is available by default to all Loqate customers using Reapit
- Email Validation and Phone Validation are optional add-ons
- The key used in the app will be your primary mechanism of reporting for usage.
- Your API key is designed to be an open access key to your account.
- Uses legacy Visualforce for Address Capture
- Customers located in China should use services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk as part of
  the base URL.
- All Loqate services require an API key for authentication purposes.
- For best experience when using Address Capture, we recommend turning off the browser
  autofill functionality for address form fields.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Email Validation is an international service with global coverage.
- Data is returned via a managed SFTP only.
- Standard is to return the data in the same format that it was sent.
- Management keys are used to provide access to server-side functions.
- any lists deleted via this endpoint are deleted permanently. We do not back up location
  lists.
- Requires the use of a Loqate Management key
- Text searches using the 'Input' field are always free.
- This method will consume credit per 'addressID' search and co-ordinates returned.
- This method will consume credit. You will be charged per address geocoded.
- Use of the output of the Global Geocoding API is temporary, and only for use as
  part of a Store Finder.
- This method will consume credit. It is charged per request regardless of the number
  of destinations.
- Each address geocoded constitutes one geocoding charge against your account.
- Blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services
  we are able to offer.
- The only supported integration currently is using JavaScript.
- Ensure attribution is visible when rendering a map.
- To enable the best customer experience, the recommendation is to send batches of
  less than 100 records which are homogenous in terms of the location.
- We don’t support API connections using HTTP - all calls should use HTTPS.
- We don’t support API connections using HTTP – make sure you are using HTTPS for
  all requests.
- This method will consume credit.
- All Loqate services require a valid API key for authentication.
- It's possible to use any API key with any Loqate service.
- Use a strong password to prevent unauthorised access to your Loqate account.
- Restrict your keys to specific services.
- Charged Requests field represents the number of API calls made, not the volume of
  transactions.
- For certain products, one API call may contain multiple addresses or emails.
