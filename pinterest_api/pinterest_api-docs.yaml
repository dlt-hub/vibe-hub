auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-authentication-and-authorization/:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with scopes. Client redirects user to Pinterest
    OAuth endpoint with client_id, redirect_uri, response_type=code, and scope (multiple
    scopes separated by spaces or commas, e.g., boards:read,pins:read). After user
    authorization, Pinterest redirects to the provided redirect_uri with authorization
    code and state parameter. The state parameter is optional but recommended for
    CSRF protection and must match between request and redirect.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow using Basic authentication. Send a POST request to https://api.pinterest.com/v5/oauth/token
    with Authorization header containing base64-encoded client_id:client_secret, and
    request body parameters grant_type set to "refresh_token", refresh_token (string
    starting with "pinr"), and optional scope. Response includes new access_token
    (prefixed with "pina"), refresh_token, and refresh_token_expires_at in Unix time.
  - Pinterest API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {your_token}". Access tokens expire within 30
    days and should be refreshed before expiration using the OAuth refresh token endpoint.
    Invalid or expired tokens return HTTP 401 with API error code 2. Tokens can be
    stored as JSON files or environment variables.
  - Pinterest API uses OAuth 2.0 with Authorization Code and Client Credentials grant
    types. For Authorization Code grant, send a POST to https://api.pinterest.com/v5/oauth/token
    with an Authorization header containing a Base64-encoded string of client_id:client_secret,
    and include grant_type set to authorization_code, code parameter with the authorization
    code received from the redirect URI, and redirect_uri that must match the registered
    value. The continuous_refresh parameter (true/false) applies only to apps created
    before September 25, 2025, to control refresh token behavior. For Client Credentials
    grant, include scope parameter (at least one required, space or comma separated)
    and set grant_type to authorization_code. The response includes an access token
    for API requests.
  - 'Pinterest API uses OAuth 2.0 with two grant types: Authorization Code and Client
    Credentials. For Authorization Code flow, POST to https://api.pinterest.com/v5/oauth/token
    with grant_type=authorization_code, code, redirect_uri, and optional continuous_refresh
    parameter in the request body. For Client Credentials flow, POST to the same endpoint
    with Authorization header containing Basic auth (base64-encoded client_id:client_secret),
    grant_type=client_credentials, and scope parameter. Access tokens are prefixed
    with ''pina''. Use https://api-sandbox.pinterest.com/v5/oauth/token for Sandbox
    environment testing.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/make-an-api-call/:
  - Pagination uses a bookmark-based approach. The response includes a bookmark field;
    pass this value as the bookmark query parameter in the next request to retrieve
    the next page of results. When bookmark is null, there are no more pages.
