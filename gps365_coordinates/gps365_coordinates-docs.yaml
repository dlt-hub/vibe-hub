auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gps365.at/cs/docs/routing:
  - 'All requests to the API endpoint https://www.gps365.at/api_routing/ must be POST
    requests and include three required parameters: action, api_token, and data (a
    JSON encoded object). The api_token parameter is used to authenticate and identify
    the user account; it must be obtained by logging into the platform and should
    be treated securely. The API token belongs to the user account that owns the relevant
    trackers, as tracker permissions granted through the platform are not enforced
    by the API.'
  - Authentication uses an API token passed as a form parameter. Include the api_token
    parameter with your request value in the POST data, for example api_token="392ea8428d10b0392c399c93810045a9".
    This token is required for all API requests to the gps365.at routing endpoint.
- information_source; https://www.gps365.at/en/docs/coordinates:
  - API token authentication is required. Pass the api_token parameter in the POST
    request body with your unique token value, e.g. api_token="392ea8428d10b0392c399c93810045a9".
    This token identifies the user and grants access to their tracker data.
  - All requests to the API must include the required parameter api_token, which identifies
    your user account. The api_token should be sent as a POST request parameter and
    must be handled securely; if compromised, contact support immediately. The API
    token should belong to the user account that owns the relevant entities (trackers)
    being accessed, as tracker permissions from the platform are not enforced by the
    API.
  - 'The API requires an api_token parameter sent in the request body. The token is
    a string value (example: "392ea8428d10b0392c399c93810045a9") that authenticates
    the request and grants access to trackers belonging to the user.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.gps365.at/en/docs/coordinates:
  - The API uses page-based pagination with a "page" optional query parameter to request
    specific pages. The documentation does not explicitly describe response fields
    indicating pagination state (such as total pages, has_more, or next_page), so
    the exact stopping condition and response structure for pagination are not fully
    specified in this excerpt.
  - Use optional query parameter "page" (starting at 1) to paginate through historic
    coordinates. Response includes "rows" (number of rows returned), "total" (total
    available rows), and "last_date" (timestamp of last row); continue requesting
    with incremented page number until rows returned is less than the limit (10,000
    for single tracker, 500 per tracker for multiple).
  - Use start and end date parameters to specify date ranges per tracker (max five
    weeks apart). The response includes a summary with rows count, total matching
    rows, and last_date field. Use last_date from the previous response as the start
    date for the next request to avoid duplicates, noting that the same record will
    appear again due to >= / <= comparison logic.
