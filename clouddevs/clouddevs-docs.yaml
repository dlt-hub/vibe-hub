auth_info:
- information_source; https://clouddevs.com/dart/building-restful-apis/:
  - Token-based authentication using JWT is supported. A token is generated when a
    user logs in and included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The
    server decodes and verifies the token to grant or deny access. API keys and OAuth
    are also mentioned as authentication options. Middleware can be used to implement
    access control and restrict routes to authenticated users.
- information_source; https://clouddevs.com/go/creating-restful-apis/:
  - The API uses a custom Authorization header-based token authentication scheme.
    The Authorization header must contain the exact token value "my-secret-token";
    requests without this header or with an incorrect token value will receive a 401
    Unauthorized response. The middleware checks the Authorization header on each
    request to the protected route before allowing access to proceed.
