auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.signnow.com/api/automated-electronic-signature-for-paycom:
  - The airSlate SignNow API uses Bearer Token authentication. After signing up for
    the API trial, you receive Client Credentials and a Basic Authorization Token
    via email. Use the Basic Authorization Token to create a Bearer Token, which is
    then sent in the Authorization header for API requests. Bearer Tokens are valid
    for 30 days and must be renewed monthly.
  - Use your Basic Authorization Token (obtained from Keys -> Test App in the Developer
    Sandbox) to create a Bearer Token, which is then used for API requests to authenticate
    subsequent calls to the airSlate SignNow API.

  - Basic Authorization Token is used to generate a Bearer Token for API requests.
    Credentials are located in the Developer Sandbox under Keys -> Test App. The Bearer
    Token should be used in subsequent API requests, typically in the Authorization
    header. Use Postman or similar tools to generate the Bearer Token from the Basic
    Authorization Token.
  - SignNow API uses Basic Authorization Token and Client Credentials for authentication.
    After signing up via their form and validating your account, you receive a Basic
    Authorization Token and Client Credentials from the Test App section in your API
    dashboard, which should be used in API requests for authentication.

  - Authentication uses OAuth2 with a password grant flow. First, obtain an access
    token by sending a POST request to https://api.signnow.com/oauth2/token with an
    Authorization header containing a Basic authorization token, along with form parameters
    username, password, grant_type set to "password", and scope set to "*". Then use
    the returned access_token in an Authorization Bearer header for subsequent API
    requests like POST /document.
