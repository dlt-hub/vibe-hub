auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.hustle.com/v3/docs/description.html:
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication with JWTs. Pass the JWT token in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" in all requests to the API.
  - 'OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required. After obtaining an access token
    (a JWT valid for 7200 seconds) from the token endpoint with client credentials
    and desired scopes (e.g., "read:account write:account"), include it in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" for all API requests. Long-running
    processes must handle token expiration by creating a new access token upon receiving
    a 401 response and retrying the request.'
  - Use Bearer token authentication by including the Authorization header with the
    format "Bearer {JWT_token}" in all API requests to https://api.hustle.com/v2/.
    The token is a JWT that must be obtained prior to making API calls.
  - Use OAuth2 client credentials flow to obtain an access token. POST to https://api.hustle.com/v2/oauth/token
    with Content-Type application/json containing grant_type "client_credentials",
    client_id, and client_secret in the request body. The response includes an access_token
    (JWT) and scope. Use the access_token in the Authorization header as a bearer
    token for subsequent API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.hustle.com/v3/docs/description.html:
  - Cursor-based pagination using query parameter cursor and optional limit parameter.
    Response includes items array, cursor field for next page, and hasMore boolean
    to indicate if more pages exist. Stop paginating when hasMore is false or cursor
    is null.
  - Responses returning lists use cursor-based pagination with items array, cursor
    string field for the next page token, and hasMore boolean to indicate if more
    results exist. Use the cursor value from the response in the next request to fetch
    subsequent pages until hasMore is false.
  - Responses use cursor-based pagination with items array, cursor string for the
    next page, and hasMore boolean indicating end of list. Pass cursor as a query
    parameter in subsequent requests; optionally pass limit query parameter (default
    100, max 1000) to control results per page.
