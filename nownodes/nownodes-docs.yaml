auth_info:
- information_source; https://nownodes.io/:
  - NOWNodes requires an API key for authentication. After signing up and logging
    into your account at account.nownodes.io, generate an API key from the Dashboard
    by clicking "Add a New Key". Use this API key to authenticate requests to their
    RPC nodes and services. Do not share your API key publicly. The documentation
    does not specify the exact header name or parameter format for sending the API
    key in requests.
- information_source; https://nownodes.io/blog/get-and-post-api-methods/:
  - Users must include their private API key in the `api-key` header when making requests
    to NOWNodes endpoints. The API key is obtained from NOWNodes and should be passed
    as a custom header named `api-key` with the value being the user's private key.
