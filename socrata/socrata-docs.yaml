auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html:
  - Application tokens are obtained by registering in your Socrata profile and are
    passed to the API to increase throttling limits. Include the token via the X-App-Token
    HTTP header (preferred method for SODA 3.0 and 2.x), or as the $$app_token query
    parameter (SODA 2.1 and 2.0), or as the app_token query parameter (SODA 1.0).
    Always use HTTPS to protect the token, as duplicate tokens will cause requests
    to count against your quota.
- information_source; https://dev.socrata.com/docs/authentication.html:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 access token-based authentication. Include the obtained access_token
    in the Authorization HTTP header as "Authorization: OAuth YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN".
    All authenticated requests must use HTTPS; requests over non-secure connections
    will result in immediate token revocation.'
  - The API supports two authentication methods. First, Basic Authentication via the
    Authorization header using Base64-encoded credentials (username:password), typically
    generated by HTTP libraries. Second, OAuth 2.0 using the server-based flow with
    callback URL, requiring application registration and following a similar pattern
    to Google AuthSub. Additionally, an X-App-Token header can be provided for app-level
    authentication.
  - 'Two authentication methods are supported: HTTP Basic Authentication (for non-interactive
    applications) and OAuth 2.0 (for interactive applications). HTTP Basic Authentication
    requires credentials sent over HTTPS using either username and password or an
    API key and secret pair, passed via standard HTTP Basic Auth headers. OAuth 2.0
    is recommended for web and mobile applications that need user authorization. API
    keys are preferred over passwords for Basic Auth as they avoid embedding credentials
    in code and work with SSO-enabled domains.'
- information_source; https://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints.html:
  - Query requests must be authenticated by a user or marked with a valid application
    token. Authentication can be provided via user credentials or an application token;
    see the authentication documentation for details on how to send these credentials
    in requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/:
  - Use the page parameter (query string, optional) with the /query endpoint to paginate
    results. The documentation snippet is incomplete but indicates page is available
    for /query but not /export.
- information_source; https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/page:
  - 'Pagination is available only with the `/query` endpoint using a `page` object
    in the request body containing `pageNumber` (required) and `pageSize` (required)
    parameters. For example, `pageNumber: 5` with `pageSize: 10` retrieves rows 41-50.
    Performance degrades significantly at higher page numbers, so filtering is recommended
    instead of pagination.'
