auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/intro:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Generate a token using the Authentication
    Helper App, then paste it into the Authorization Header field for API requests.
  - Most API endpoints require authentication with a JWT obtained via Sign-In with
    Ethereum (SIWE). The JWT token should be sent with API requests; a helper app
    is provided in the documentation to generate tokens and sign Safe transactions.
- information_source; https://docs.gnosispay.com/auth:
  - Authentication uses Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) with JWT tokens. Submit a POST
    request to /api/v1/auth/challenge with JSON body containing message, signature,
    and ttlInSeconds fields. Upon successful verification, a jwt is returned and must
    be included in the Authorization header as "Bearer {jwt}" for all subsequent API
    requests. The jwt remains valid for up to 24 hours based on ttlInSeconds parameter
    (minimum 1 hour), and each authentication attempt requires a unique nonce. Ensure
    the SIWE message domain and uri fields are not set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost to
    avoid firewall blocks.
