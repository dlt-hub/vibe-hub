auth_info:
- information_source; https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-Authenticate-a-REST-API-in-Power-BI/td-p/1883942:
  - Bearer token authentication is used, passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    " concatenated with an Access_Token() value. The token is included in the headers
    parameter of Web.Contents() requests to the Power BI API endpoint.
  - 'The API uses OAuth2 password grant flow authentication. Include the following
    headers in your request: Accept set to application/json, Content-Type set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
    grant_type set to password, username set to your Pulseway username, password set
    to your Pulseway password, and tenant set to your Pulseway company tenant name.
    These credentials should be sent as header parameters with the API request.'

  - Authorization uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Set the Authorization header to
    "Basic " followed by a base64-encoded string of "your_email:jira_token" (with
    a space between "Basic" and the encoded string).
  - Jira REST API uses bearer token authentication. The personal access token must
    be passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer " followed by the token value.
    The token is obtained from the Jira website and should be stored securely. The
    Accept header should be set to "application/json" for JSON responses.

  - Bearer token authentication is required. Pass the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer " & Token for all requests to the API endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-Authenticate-a-REST-API-in-Power-BI/td-p/1883942:
  - The pagination uses OData conventions. Responses include an @odata.nextLink field
    containing the full URL for the next page of results. Continue fetching pages
    by following @odata.nextLink until it is null or absent, indicating the final
    page. The baseUrl parameter initiates the first request with includeMetadata=true
    as a query parameter.
- information_source; https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Pagination-of-a-REST-API-in-Power-Query-using-M/td-p/1901067:
  - Pagination uses query parameters $skip and $top for offset-based pagination. $skip
    specifies the number of records to skip (calculated as page index multiplied by
    records per page), and $top specifies the maximum number of records to return
    per page. The API endpoint /count returns TotalRecords, which is divided by RecordsPerPage
    to determine the total number of pages needed.
  - Use $skip and $top query parameters for pagination. $top specifies the number
    of records per page (e.g., $top=10), and $skip specifies how many records to skip
    before retrieving the next batch (e.g., $skip=30 for page 2 with 10 per page).
    Combine them in the URL as ?$skip=0&$top=10, incrementing $skip by the $top value
    for each subsequent page, and stop when fewer records than $top are returned.
