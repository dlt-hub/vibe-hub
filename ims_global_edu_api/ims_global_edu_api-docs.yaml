auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.imsglobal.org/blog:
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token with Client Credentials grant is required for OneRoster
    1.1 and 1.2. The bearer token must be included in the Authorization header of
    REST API requests. OneRoster 1.0's OAuth 1.0a message signing is deprecated and
    no longer available for adoption or certification.
- information_source; https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with bearer token authentication. Obtain an access
    token by POSTing to the token endpoint with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
    grant_type=client_credentials, and scope parameters, using base64-encoded consumer
    key and secret for authorization. The response includes access_token, token_type
    (bearer), expires_in (default 3600 seconds), and scope. Use the access token in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" when making resource requests.
    TLS is required for all exchanges.
  - The security model requires OAuth 2 Bearer Tokens with Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) 1.2 or 1.3 (SSL prohibited). Additionally, OAuth 1.0a request signing must
    use SHA2 (256) for compatibility.
- information_source; https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v1p0/cert:
  - OAuth 2 authorization is required for many CLR service endpoints. CLR Consumers,
    CLR Providers, and CLR Hosts must support the OAuth 2 Authorization Code grant
    flow and/or Client Credentials grant flow.
- information_source; https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-rs/v1p0/devguide:
  - Basic HTTP authentication with Base64 encoding of client credentials, sent via
    the Authorization header. The token endpoint at POST https://imsglobal.org/ims/rs/v1p0/token
    requires an Authorization header with value "Basic BASE64_ENCODED_STRING" where
    the Base64 string is client_id:client_secret, a Content-Type header set to application/json,
    and a JSON body containing grant_type set to "client_credentials" and username
    set to the user identifier. The response includes an access_token field for subsequent
    API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/eduapi/v1p0:
  - Pagination uses limit (PositiveInteger, optional, query parameter) and offset
    (NonNegativeInteger, optional, query parameter) to control page size and starting
    position for retrieving collectionOfferings for a student.
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, PositiveInteger) and offset (optional, NonNegativeInteger)
    query parameters to control page size and starting position for results.
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, query parameter specifying download size) and
    offset (optional, query parameter specifying number to skip) parameters. The response
    returns a Person[] array; continue paginating by incrementing offset by limit
    value until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, PositiveInteger, optional) and offset
    (query parameter, implied) to control page size and starting position. Response
    structure for pagination fields is not shown in this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional PositiveInteger) and offset (query
    parameter) to request pages of ComponentOfferings. The response structure for
    indicating total results or next page information is not described in this excerpt.
