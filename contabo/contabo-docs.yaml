auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.contabo.com/:
  - API uses bearer token authentication. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}". The x-request-id header (UUID4 format) is also
    required for all requests.
  - 'Authentication uses bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}". The exact header name is "Authorization"
    and the token should be prefixed with "Bearer ".'
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}". Additionally, x-request-id (UUID)
    and x-trace-id (string) headers should be included in requests for tracing purposes.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}". Additionally, include x-request-id and x-trace-id
    headers in the request, though these appear to be for request tracking rather
    than authentication.
  - 'Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the access token as "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" in the request
    headers. Additionally, include x-request-id as a UUID4 string and x-trace-id as
    a string identifier in the headers for request tracking and support purposes.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.contabo.com/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, example page=1) for the page number
    and size (integer, example size=10) for elements per page. Stop paginating when
    the returned data array is empty or contains fewer elements than the requested
    size.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a _pagination object in the response
    containing size (items per page, default 10), totalElements (total count), totalPages,
    and page (current page number starting at 1). Pass page and size as query parameters
    to navigate pages; stop when page exceeds totalPages.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page and size (optional,
    defaults provided). The response includes a _pagination object containing size
    (items per page), totalElements (total count), totalPages (total pages), and page
    (current page number). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page
    parameter until page equals totalPages.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page and size (optional,
    defaults shown in response). The response includes a _pagination object with size,
    totalElements, totalPages, and page fields. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing
    the page parameter until page equals totalPages.
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with the response containing a _pagination
    object with fields: size (items per page), totalElements (total count), totalPages
    (total pages), and page (current page number, 1-indexed). Include page and size
    as query parameters in requests to navigate pages.'
