auth_info:

  - Access tokens expire after 1 hour and must be refreshed by obtaining a new access_token
    as per step 2 when a 401 Unauthorized error is received. The API uses app_id and
    app_key credentials that are managed through the Hub's API Access section, where
    merchants can create and manage multiple app_id values under a single merchant
    profile.
  - Acquired.com uses OAuth 2.0 with bearer token authentication. Obtain an access
    token by sending your app_id and app_key credentials to the login endpoint (https://test-api.acquired.com/v1/login
    for QA or https://api.acquired.com/v1/login for production), then pass the returned
    access token in the HTTP Authorization header as a bearer token for subsequent
    API requests. Access tokens are valid for 1 hour and must be refreshed after expiration.
    Your IP address must be whitelisted to authenticate successfully.
  - To authenticate with the API, obtain an app_id and app_key from Hub Settings >
    API Access, then POST these credentials to the /login endpoint in a JSON body
    with fields "app_id" and "app_key". The response contains an access_token with
    token_type "Bearer" that expires in 3600 seconds; include this token in the Authorization
    header for subsequent API requests. When receiving a 401 Unauthorized response,
    obtain a new access_token by repeating the login request.
