notes:
- All requests to these endpoints must include the authentication headers.
- Ensure that the ports are not blocked by your firewall.
- All server-to-server API requests must be authenticated.
- Requests with invalid key or signature are immediately rejected.
- This choice is not permanent. If you join in 'Listen only' mode, you can easily
  activate your microphone later from the main control bar.

- This plugin is a client that connects your WordPress site to a PlugNmeet server.
- You must have either a self-hosted server or a PlugNmeet Cloud subscription for
  the plugin to work.
- You must replace the API details from your own self-hosted or PlugNmeet Cloud server.
- The demo server is for temporary testing only and has limitations.
- It is highly recommended to allow the LTI tool to send the `launcher's name`.
- The generated token is short-lived and designed for one-time use. You should consume
  it immediately.
- Default starting index for records is 0.
- Default maximum number of records to return is 20.
- Default sort order is DESC.
- A shared network filesystem (e.g., NFS, Samba (CIFS), GlusterFS, or S3-compatible)
  accessible by all plugnmeet-server and plugnmeet-recorder instances is critical
  for data consistency.
