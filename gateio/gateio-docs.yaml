auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gate.io/docs/broker-api/broker/en/index.html:
  - API authentication uses HMAC-SHA512 signing with three required headers. Include
    your API key in the KEY header, a Unix timestamp in the Timestamp header, and
    an HMAC-SHA512 signature in the SIGN header. The signature is computed by HMAC-SHA512
    signing a string composed of the HTTP method, request path (prefix + url), query
    parameters, SHA512 hash of the body, and timestamp, all separated by newlines,
    using your API secret as the key.
  - API key and HMAC-SHA512 signature authentication is required. Send the API key
    in the `KEY` header, include a `Timestamp` header with the current Unix timestamp,
    and compute an HMAC-SHA512 signature of the request method, path, query parameters,
    SHA512-hashed body, and timestamp using your API secret, then send the signature
    in the `SIGNATURE` header.
  - API key and HMAC-SHA512 signature authentication required. Send the API key in
    the URL path parameter `key`, and include a signature in request headers generated
    by HMAC-SHA512 signing the HTTP method, request path, and query parameters using
    your API secret.
  - API key and secret are required for authentication. The credentials are used to
    generate an HMAC signature that is added to request headers via a gen_sign function.
    The signature is computed from the HTTP method, request path, query parameters,
    and request body. Include the signed headers in all authenticated requests.
  - API key and secret are required for authentication. The key pair must be maintained
    securely without storing the secret in plain text. The broker uses its own key
    pair with Broker permissions enabled for `/broker` interface operations, while
    sub-accounts use their own generated key pairs for wallet and trading operations.
    Authentication is performed using API key and secret via HMAC.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.gate.io/docs/broker-api/broker/en/index.html:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, controls maximum number of records
    per request) and offset (query parameter, optional, list offset starting position)
    for offset-based pagination. No response fields indicate pagination state or next
    page information.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, controls maximum number of results)
    and offset (query parameter, optional, starting position for list). Provide limit
    and offset values in subsequent requests to navigate pages.
  - The offset parameter is a query parameter (integer, optional) that specifies the
    list offset starting position for pagination. The response returns a list of BrokerSubAccount
    objects, but no response pagination fields or navigation instructions are documented.
- information_source; https://www.gate.io/tr/api2:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (as shown in the example GET request with
    ?page=1). The response includes a page field indicating the current page number.
    To paginate, increment the page parameter in subsequent requests.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a page parameter (String, optional,
    starting from page 1) submitted as a POST request parameter. The response structure
    for pagination fields is not documented in the provided excerpt.
