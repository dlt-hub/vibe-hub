notes:
- Install the Maker API app. It will allow you to select the devices you want to expose
  to the api and also provide with sample url's (including your tokens).
- If you need a device id in Hubitat, it shows up in the url when you access the device
  on the Devices page.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Device web page hangs regardless of the nature of the device.
- 'Last updated: 03/21/25'
- Requires C8 pro hub for certain features
- Only the C8 and C8 Pro support commissioning the hub via WiFi.
- The mynewhubitat is there to allow the configuration to be modified so the hub might
  then participate in an existing wifi network as a client. Not as a server.
- All Apps and Basic Rules stop working after a few days after a Hub firmware update.
- The Hubitat community is a rich and helpful collection of people.
- There is abundant help here.
- Discover the resources you need to keep your Hubitat Elevation hub running happy.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 500 series z-wave locks have had issues with the 700/800 series hubs.
- Most breakins are because of opportunity.
- Looking for a hard wired CCT led controller compatible with Hubitat.
- Zigbee CCT LED controllers like GLEDOPTO work great with Hubitat.
- Some dashboards may become unresponsive after firmware updates.
- You should be able to add your variables using this option.
- If you want to create new variables it's under *Settings Tab | Hub Variables*.
- Accessing an EZ dashboard from the cloud requires an access token, which is not
  available in the local dashboard mode.
- We can have a toggle to disable it entirely.
- The app should connect to the hub whether you are local or remote without any workarounds
  or messing around with links.
- When using files in a dashboard from Hub Local File Manager, they are setup in a
  full URL format.
- Some objects like Water Valve may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- It may be worth a read about SS bootstrapping issue
- Some users experience save button issues on iPhone app
- Works with Apple Home (iOS 18.4 or above)
- Works with Samsung SmartThings
- This is a known quirk people have run into with repeating notifications on battery
  checks.
- Battery reporting is almost always not a reliable indicator of anything.
- Uses Actuator capability to set pressure value.
- Pressure is reported in hPa.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in Ecobee
- Ensure to handle rate limiting properly.
- For desired color changes, the 'Default Transition Time' should be set to zero.
- This is a bug in HSM. Found and fixed, heading to a release.
- It was the new app that was the problem since I have an older version of the hub
  operating system.
- The app uses an embedded browser that may behave differently based on the system's
  default browser.
- Optional 30-minute auto-disable for logging to reduce clutter.
- The iPhone app does not support token retrieval yet.
- Make sure to use the correct API token for authorization.
- You will have to redo all of your room assignments in the Home App on your phone
- If you're running on a Raspberry Pi, you should have a look at the Wiki
- This requires an Apprise API instance to be set up.
- 'HTTP basic auth. username and password: if you protected your Apprise API behind
  HTTP basic authentication, enter the values here.'
- Some devices may require multiple manual wake ups to sync.
- Facilitates the creation of new devices which have the same information in them.
- Allows cloning of devices with the same capabilities, inputs, states.
- The motor has to be paired to a Tuya hub then configured via their app.
- In the latest version of the product, none of the configuration options can be done
  via motor or remote buttons.
- Uses Tuya gateway for configuration of limits
- Different manufacturers of the same model may behave differently
- MotionAware is available in the API
- Uses Ollama for LLM processing â€” requires setup of Ollama instance with appropriate
  models.
- Context is stored within the chat, and larger conversations may impact performance.
- Expose Ollama to the Network must be turned on
- Ensure to allow access through windows firewall
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in Hubitat
- Uses REST API for file management operations
- Access token is valid for 60 minutes.
- 'New attribute ''mediaType'' added with values: ''photo'' or ''video''.'
- The state.accessToken entry is the OAuth access token for Hubitat (used when Google
  calls us back in the auth process).
- Feedback and feature requests are open for community input.
- Hubitat can only use one or the other -- if using ethernet, wifi is not available
  as fall-back / backup option.
- This is a very simple but important rule.
- Uses impeler-based pumps which depend on exact setup could be leaking
- There is no 'low liquid level' warning
- Hub login security is disabled by default
- To clear old states, switch to the 'Device' driver type and delete all current states.
- Hubitat runs locally for unmatched speed, reliability, and total data privacy.
- Zigbee/z-wave, hubitat compatible and waterproof is a must.
- Child devices of the integration app are not compatible with the swap device tool.
- If anyone is going to do it first, it would be on homeassistant.
- Migration from C7 to C8 Pro may result in missing Z-wave devices.
- Push and hold functionality is not supported in the Hubitat Dashboard.
- openweathermap api 2.5 will be down soon
- 3.0 is already integrated to webcore
- Using a global variable to pass the string is one way.
- Local endpoint trigger allows passing values via URL.
- WHA is 'Whole House Audio' created for synchronized audio on devices.
- Triggers are events, not states. 'Present' and 'Not Present' are States and not
  events. 'Arriving' and 'Departing' are events.
- The Zen32 has LED indicators for the state, so it makes sense to treat them like
  switches.
- Alexa will not see virtual SWITCHES. You need to make them CONTACT SENSORS.
- Be sure you obtained the right model to do power monitoring.
- 3rd Reality fixed it (which I thought was very smart and responsive - I think a
  3rd reality engineer hangs out here) and the firmware update button works.
- I note as well that they are shaped so you don't cover the 2nd plug of an outlet,
  a weakness of many outlets like Cmars, eWelink etc.
- Firmware version 2.4.0.146 has issues with captive Wi-Fi portal requiring Ethernet
  for setup.
- Button events like 'pushed' always have a button number associated with them.
- It's an old z-wave device that doesn't send a status update to the hub to avoid
  infringing on Lutron's (now expired) patent.
- Ensure that you have selected the four required API services especially Device Status
  Notification, Smart Home Scene Linkage, IOT Core, Authorization.
- This step is the most often seen issue for the driver not to work, you may need
  to try other countries if you cannot authenticate.
- In general, the hub only needs a minute or two to shut down.
- Some objects may not transition states correctly.
- Optimised battery performance.
- Stability improvements.
- Hubitat's cloud setup seems to be a bit unreliable.
- Rebooting the hub and updating from .192/.193 to .197 resolved some issues.
- Debug logging is useful for troubleshooting commands being sent to devices.
- The device itself doesn't display the illuminance.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Sending a Refresh Command with a little delay (1sec) after sending Unlock/Lock commands
  updates Status near instantly.
- Confirmed that the lock code info is stored and maintained even after module replacement!
- You can also store your door codes in the Lock Manager App.
- The documentation should have quotes around the handler method name.
- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UPDATED YOUR BULB TO THE LATEST FIRMWARE (via the Hue app using
  Bluetooth if you do not have a Hue hub)
- When updating the driver please run the 'Configure' command or simply update the
  preferences and save as that will also configure the bulb.
- After upgrading the driver you will need to select 'Configure' on each device to
  push the updated settings to the bulb.
- Device firmware may need to be updated for optimal performance.
- Behavior of devices becoming unresponsive after router reboot is unexpected.
- Uses WiFi and Zigbee protocols which may interfere with each other.
- If your smoke detector doesnâ€™t have a UL certification marking on it, you should
  seriously consider replacing it with a smoke detector marketed for sale in North
  America.
- Distance is not the only factor affecting connections. Things like water piping,
  HVAC ductwork, appliances, brick walls, etc. can block the connection.
- Hubitat does publish the code for a Generic Component Switch in their code examples
  on Github.
- Some devices may throw multiple errors in the engineer logs.

- No State for accessToken
- Ensure correct setup for local endpoint triggers.
- '403 Forbidden: Check API key or permissions'
- '408 Request Timeout: Ensure proper URL encoding'
- If things sudden stop working it is probably because your trial subscription has
  expired.
- '404: Page not found'
- cloud service is unavailable
- 'GROUP_NOT_FOUND: Ensure groups are properly set up and re-added if necessary'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency.'
