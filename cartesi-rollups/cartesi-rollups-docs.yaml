notes:
- This is documentation for Cartesi Documentation 0.8, which is no longer actively
  maintained.
- This version is no longer actively maintained.
- Cartesi dApps are implemented as infinite loops that manage their transaction cycles
  through HTTP POST requests to the /finish endpoint.
- The Cartesi machine is self-contained and can't make an external request.
- GraphQL query responses are given in JSON format.
- The payload string should be URL-encoded; the inspect server will decode the string
  to UTF-8.
- This method is synchronous, so it is not advised to perform resource-intensive operations.
errors:
- The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax
