notes:
- THIS FUNCTION/CLASS IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED.
- Will be removed march 2016.
- Interactive Video implements xAPI statements, making it possible to capture responses
  from users.
- Some content types may not be accessible based on user permissions.
- No timetable has been established for when the features will be added.
- The platform is free. It's being developed very quickly and it's stable and being
  used by websites with hundreds of thousands visitors per month.
- H5P is a plugin for existing publishing systems that enables the system to create
  interactive content like Interactive Videos, Presentations, Games, Quizzes and more.
- To make your site supports H5P, you need to install a plugin.
- 'The H5P files aren''t on github. You may find all libraries here: https://h5p.org/update-all-content-types'
- H5P content is publicly available unless specified otherwise.
- This page offers advice to help you in your efforts to become GDPR compliant.
- You may be requested to retrieve, export, rectify or erase personal data.
- The parameters you would like to change are upload_max_filesize and post_max_size.
- post_max_size should always be larger or equal to upload_max_filesize.
- If you set upload_max_filesize to 64M and post_max_size to 128M, this means that
  you can upload two files at max 64M at the same time.
- After saving the changes to php.ini, you will need to restart your web server so
  that it reloads the new php.ini.
- Increasing these limits may make your server more vulnerable to Denial of Service
  attacks.
- As of PHP 5.3.1 there's a setting called max_file_uploads that will limit the number
  of simultaneous uploads for all users.
- Cloning has been removed from H5P.org.
- H5P plugin should be activated after installation to start creating content.
- Ensure URLs are correctly configured in your WordPress setup.
- For Interactive Video at least, the videos can be hosted anywhere, as long as it's
  one of the compatible formats (mp4, webm). The url also needs to end in e.g. .mp4
  (but that can be hacked by adding a query or fragment part to the URL if needed)
- Make sure your web server has write access to wp-content/uploads/h5p.
- If everything went smooth, you should now be ready to start creating H5P activities
  in your courses.
- H5P for Moodle is also implemented as a filter, which means that where there is
  a WYSIWYG editor in Moodle, you and your students can embed H5P files.
- H5P does not have a built-in LRS which captures xAPI statements that H5Ps generate
  in Drupal.
- You must make sure that the user running PHP/Apache has write access to the temporary
  directory, which in your case is /tmp
- You can FTP in and check if you have a tmp directory, if so try changing the permissions
  so everyone can write to it.
- Most hosting companies have different/special kinds of setups, so best to follow
  their instructions or just contact them and get them to fix it.
- Library administration accessible in both Wordpress and Drupal.
- The option to delete libraries currently isn't supported in Moodle. However, it
  will be added to the plugin soon.
- Taking libraries directly from github is only recommended for development purposes
  as there can be unfinished features or bugs on the master branch.
- In Moodle there's no logic implemented for deleting libraries.
- I wouldn't recommend using GitHub as a source for several reasons.
- The evaluation of answers will be moved server side in future versions to avoid
  this.
- A mix of issues that does not fit in the other categories.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Validating h5p package failed.
- The system could not install the component Drag N Bar of the package, requires a
  newer version of the H5P extension. This site is currently running version 1.23,
  while the required version is 1.24 or higher.
- Content types on h5p.org have updates not yet available on H5P.com due to quality
  assurance processes.
- Common issue users run into is that their PHP extensions are not enabled or set
  up correctly.
- You may have to be an administrator to access the settings.
- On H5P.com LaTeX is enabled for all customers.
- Mathematical expressions can be added to all text fields in the H5P authoring tool.
- MathJax may render source LaTeX for up to one second before displaying the HTML.
- H5P provides an ever growing number of content types.
- To provide a best possible experience for new users, H5P.org should only be used
  for trying out H5P.
- To create H5P content on your own site, you must have the H5P plugin installed and
  enabled on your site.
- Plugins that support content authoring currently exist for WordPress, Drupal and
  Moodle.
- H5P is an open source community driven project.
- Currently this is not possible. Only the author can make changes to their content.
  Although they can download/upload your content to edit it.
- H5P generates xAPI statements which are captured by a plugin that sends them to
  an LRS.
- Learning Record Stores are required to store xAPI statements.
- Using H5P with WordPress for educational content.
- The Audio Recorder content type does not send any results. It can only record and
  download the recorded audio.
- To get started with H5P in Blackboard just go to H5P.com and start a 30 days free
  trial.
- Make sure your Blackboard admin is ready to set up the LTI integration.
- H5P.com is a paid service that is offered for 30 days as a trial period.
- To get started with H5P in Canvas just go to H5P.com and start a 30 days free trial.
- If you use the embed feature the scores/data will not be generated.
- H5P.com can be connected to any number of Canvas instances.
- The embed functionality is not yet implemented in Moodle as far as I know.
- Many people have requested the embed feature, so it is definitely still on the roadmap
  of H5P.
- Some H5P content may not display properly when embedded in Moodle labels.
- H5P provides a very tight integration with Moodle through H5P.com.
- To get started with H5P in Moodle just go to H5P.com and start a 30 days free trial.
- You can’t open H5P file on your machine, it has to be uploaded to a site supporting
  H5P
- When creating content, under 'Display options', the 'Download' button needs to be
  enabled.
- H5P.org doesn't support uploading of external H5P's.
- Even if a content type does not have built-in support for a language it is possible
  to create content in that language since all texts are customizable.
- HtML editor is not included to help make creating contents as simple as possible.
- Import and export of content is built in to H5P.
- H5P is platform agnostic.
- H5P has a modular architecture and the building blocks of H5P are called libraries.
- The content structure is optional, so in essence an .h5p file could be used only
  to transfer libraries between different websites.
- The development tool for H5P is in a beta-state.
- The content.json file is part of each downloadable h5p-file.
- H5P can be embedded anywhere you can insert HTML iFrames.
- H5P.org is for testing purposes only. You should not use it to host 'real' content.
- If you want full control of your content types, have a go at using H5P in one of
  the supported plugins.
- There is no time limit for videos on h5p.org; they stay until deleted.
- H5P does not include its own LRS integration. Instead, H5P generates the statements
  and makes them available for the publishing platform.
- The problem is probably that your Moodle installation is missing some php libraries.
  Most likely something relating to zip (H5P content requires zipping, because data
  is transferred zipped).
- H5P is an open source project that aims to be community driven.
- Content can be moved between sites with H5P installed using the .h5p file.
- H5P tries to use the MIT license wherever possible due to the freedom it gives.
- Some third party code used for purifying the user input is GPL licensed.
- H5P’s goal is to enable everyone to create better content faster.
- H5P is breaking down barriers for creating, sharing and reusing interactive content.
