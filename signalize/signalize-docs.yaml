auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.signalize.com/:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send credentials via the ApiKeyAuth scheme,
    which typically involves an API key header (exact header name not specified in
    this excerpt, but standard practice is Authorization: Bearer <api_key> or X-API-Key:
    <api_key>). Consult Signalize documentation for the precise header name and how
    to obtain your API key.'
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization header
    as a bearer token. A 401 response indicates the API key is missing or invalid.
  - Authentication is required via API key, which must be provided (missing or invalid
    API key results in 401 Unauthorized). The documentation does not specify the exact
    header name, parameter name, or method for submitting the API key.
  - Signalize API uses API key authentication. Include your API key via the ApiKeyAuth
    authorization scheme when making requests to protected endpoints like POST /v3/pushmessages.
    The exact header name and format are not specified in this documentation excerpt,
    but authentication is required; requests without valid credentials return a 401
    Unauthorized response.
  - The API uses ApiKeyAuth for authentication. The API key must be provided to access
    this endpoint, and requests without a valid API key will return a 401 Unauthorized
    response.
