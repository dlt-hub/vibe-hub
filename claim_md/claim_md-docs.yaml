auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.claim.md:
  - AccountKey is required in the request body as a string parameter for authentication.
    This key must be obtained from Claim.MD and sent with each API request to authorize
    access to claim appeal operations.
  - Claim.MD API requires an AccountKey parameter sent in the request body (application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    format) for authentication. The AccountKey serves as the API credential needed
    to access the uploadlist endpoint and other services.
  - Receive delayed claim status updates by periodically calling this service. Authentication
    requires an AccountKey (Claim.MD API Key) sent as a required form parameter in
    the request body along with a required ResponseID parameter.
  - The API requires an AccountKey parameter sent in the request body as form-encoded
    data. This AccountKey appears to be associated with an account and is necessary
    for authenticating requests to endpoints like /services/appeal/ and /services/payerlist/.
  - The API requires an AccountKey parameter sent in the request payload (application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    format). This appears to be an API key or account identifier that must be included
    with each request to authenticate.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.claim.md:
  - Pagination uses an optional Page parameter in the request body (string type, up
    to 500 results per page). Response structure for navigation fields is not explicitly
    documented in the provided excerpt.
  - Use ResponseID from the response as the ResponseID parameter in the next request
    to retrieve subsequent updates. The last_responseid attribute in the result indicates
    the most recent response ID. Max 20,000 results per request.
  - Use the Page parameter (request body, optional) to paginate results when more
    than 100 ERA records exist. Store the last_eraid value from responses and pass
    it in the ERAID parameter for subsequent requests to retrieve only new remittances.
- information_source; https://api.claim.md/:
  - Pagination uses an optional Page parameter in the request body to retrieve up
    to 500 results per page. The documentation does not specify response fields indicating
    total pages, next page, or when to stop paginating.
  - The ERA List service uses offset-based pagination with a Page parameter in the
    request body to retrieve results when more than 1000 records exist. Additionally,
    store the "last_eraid" value from responses and pass it as the ERAID parameter
    to fetch only new remittances since the last query.
