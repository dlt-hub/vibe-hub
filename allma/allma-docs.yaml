notes:
- Only GET requests are permitted in the guest sandbox.
- Your application should connect to the API gateways only via HTTPS using TLS 1.2
  or TLS 1.3.
- Users must log out of Rosetta in order to end a Rosetta session (single sign-out
  is not supported).
- Only one SAML profile can be defined as the default authentication preference.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in Voyager
- Credentials must be provided by institutions to access services.
- Ex Libris APIs and API Materials are made available for use and access by Members
  that are customers of the relevant Ex Libris programs and services for their internal
  purposes.
- Requests are sent with a defined timeout of 5 seconds.
- SSL connections must be secured with a certificate issued by a recognized certificate
  authority.
- Alma sends the webhooks asynchronous to the updates in Alma’s DB.
- EDI communication should work with any vendor that uses the EDI message types used
  by Alma, but it has not been tested.
- The file name of EDI files in the input directory is limited to 100 characters,
  including the full path from the FTP root directory, including the directory.
- When using the ListRecords verb to query a set, the deleted records which are not
  in the set anymore, will not be presented as part of the results.
- When using the GetRecord verb with an explicit identifier, if the record was published
  by several profiles, you will get the latest version of the record.
- Nginx isn’t needed for Nedap & Seret – link directly to the RFID driver.
- Nginx can be configured to listen on any port.
- Using an SSL/TLS encryption wrapper is mandatory, as all communications between
  Alma and third-party integrations must be secured with SSL.
- The SIP2 integration is intended for use with self-check machines, laptop lockers,
  scanning wands, sorting machines, payment kiosks, etc. Using the SIP2 protocol for
  other workflows such as bulk actions using automatically run scripts is not supported.
- An institution must turn on the SRU target functionality.
- The query can be limited to only return non-suppressed records by adding 'alma.mms_tagSuppressed=false'
  to the search query.
- The integration is intended for inter-library loan, copy catalog, or selection.
- The Z39.50 integration is intended for integrating Alma search with other automated
  systems for the purposes of inter-library loan, copy catalog, or selection.
- Using the Z39.50 integration for other workflows, such as performing bulk export
  of records, is not supported.
