notes:
- Campaign selection is not available for this integration
- Simplified authorization using standard bearer authorization.
- The Scope3 v1 API will be sunset in early 2025.
- Convert your API client access and client ID keys to the new bearer token format.
- The Google Sheet uses V1 APIs that will be decommissioned in early 2025.
- The existing Snowflake connectors will work until the end of 2024.
- Yesterday's data will be available via API no later than 8 am UTC the following
  day.
- The latest dataset should not be used for any production purposes.
- Scope3 parses ads.txt files to determine which rows apply to which geos and channels.
- As of the ads.txt specification (1.2), there is no standardized way to signal that
  a particular row applies only to a particular geography or channel.
- The API was designed with scale in mind.
- It is not designed to be a real-time system.
- Upload creative delivery data to share with partners
- Data can used directly or Share Data with Clients.
- Hourly data is recommended for accurate emissions calculations.
- Available measurement response fields include total_emissions_grams, compensated_emissions_grams,
  and climate_risk_compliant.
- Response configuration is done in the Integrate UI.
- The Scope3 RTDP provides low latency (sub 10 ms) access to the Inventory Intelligence
  dataset.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The RTDP provides low latency access to Inventory Intelligence dataset.
- Requires an authentication key to use the real-time data provider.
- Scope3 uses global_placement_id as its primary key to identify placements.
- For just artifact IDs, a GET request is sent to an HTTP endpoint.
- For the full Content Schema, a POST request is sent with the JSON in the body.
- The default expiration time for SAS tokens is 8 hours. Set a reasonable expiration
  time that enables you to successfully complete your transfer. We recommend at least
  6 months.
- Basic SAS tokens cannot be revoked. The only way to invalidate a basic SAS token
  is to remove your account's storage access key.
- 'Media delivery supports the following file types: .csv, .ndjson, .jsonl, .parquet,
  and .avro.'
- Your files will not be deleted. The information is copied, so your data remains
  safe and sound.
- There is currently no hard limit, but we suggest keeping files to a maximum of 1GB.
- User providing authorization needs Admin, Standard, or Read-Only access
- Both authorization boxes must be checked to use the integration successfully
- Files will not be deleted from the bucket when pulled into the Scope3 system with
  the Integrate automation.
- Currently no hard limit for uploads into the cloud bucket, but suggested maximum
  is 1GB.
- All changes must be made from a Google Workspace administrator account associated
  with the ad accounts in question
- App is currently unverified due to pending privacy policy review
- User needs Admin, Standard, or Read-Only access to authorize the integration.
- Both authorization boxes must be checked to use the integration successfully.
- If Method 1 doesn’t work, attempt Method 2
- Required fields include utc_datetime, impressions, inventory_id, deal_id, deal_name,
  advertiser_id, advertiser_name, campaign_group_id, campaign_id, insertion_order_id,
  line_item_id, creative_id, creative_group_id, spend, plays.
- Input fields include utc_datetime, activity_type, impressions, deal_id, campaign_id,
  advertiser_id, campaign_group_id, line_item_id, and insertion_order_id as required
  based on other fields.
- Scope3's brand suitability classification is built on full transparency, client
  accessibility, and AI-driven decisioning.
- Scope3 ingests and processes content from multiple sources to provide complete coverage
  across the digital ecosystem.
- Strongly recommend reaching out to Scope3 to set up a publisher account.
- Content classification can take a few seconds or even minutes during high-load periods.
- Publishers may upload one or multiple pieces of content by sending newline-separated
  JSON (aka JSONL) to the File Upload API.
errors:
- '429 Too Many Requests: Retry the request after a small delay.'
- File acceptance is a critical step in the integration setup process. Without file
  acceptance, the process cannot continue.
- 'App is Blocked: Confirm settings for unconfigured apps'
