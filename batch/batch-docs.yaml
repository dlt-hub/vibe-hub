    API key must be sent in the Authorization header prefixed with Bearer (example:
    Authorization: Bearer EC3DBFXPZ67RTCDEF). Additionally, the Project key must be
    included in the X-Batch-Project header (example: X-Batch-Project: project_2bcdf83eubjhfdmk78jf).
    The Content-Type header must be set to application/json. The REST API key is obtained
    from the project settings on the Batch dashboard and is restricted to account
    managers only; it should be kept secret and never used in client applications.'
