auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/api-reference.html:
  - All REST APIs to PrizmDoc Cloud must be authenticated with an API key or OAuth
    token. Refer to the Cloud Authentication section for specific details on how to
    send these credentials in requests.
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/v3-viewing-package-creators.html:
  - Accusoft-Affinity-Token header is required when server clustering is enabled.
    Send this token in the request headers to identify the affinity context for the
    viewing package creation process.
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/getting-started-viewing-part-2.html:
  - Acs-Api-Key header is required for PrizmDoc Cloud. Send your API key in the Acs-Api-Key
    request header when uploading source documents via PUT request to the ViewingSession
    endpoint. If using self-hosted backend, omit this header.
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/getting-started-viewing-part-3.html:
  - API Key authentication is required for PrizmDoc Cloud. The API key must be sent
    in the Acs-Api-Key header with each request to the PAS endpoint at https://api.accusoft.com/prizmdoc/.
    Set the header value to YOUR_API_KEY and replace it with your actual API key.
  - API key authentication is required. The API key must be sent as the `acs-api-key`
    request header. Set the server variable `HTTP_ACS_API_KEY` to your actual API
    key value, which will automatically add this header to all proxied requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/back-end-proxy.html:
  - The GET /v2/viewingSessions/{viewingSessionId}/revisionData endpoint supports
    pagination using limit and continueToken query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls the number of results returned per request, and continueToken is used
    to retrieve subsequent pages by passing the token from the previous response to
    get the next set of results.
  - The GET /v2/viewingSessions/{viewingSessionId}/revisionData endpoint supports
    pagination with limit (query parameter, optional, controls page size) and continueToken
    (query parameter, optional, used to retrieve the next page by passing the token
    from the previous response). Stop paginating when no continueToken is returned
    in the response.
- information_source; https://help.accusoft.com/PrizmDoc/latest/HTML/pas-pii-detectors.html:
  - Pagination uses a continuation token model. The response includes a `continueToken`
    field and a `continueAfter` field (millisecond delay). To fetch the next batch
    of results, pass the `continueToken` value as a query string parameter in a subsequent
    request. Stop paginating when no `continueToken` is returned in the response.
  - Pagination uses limit and continueToken query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls the number of results per request, and continueToken from the response
    is used in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages. Pagination ends when
    continueToken is not returned in the response.
  - The GET endpoint uses a `continueToken` field in the response to paginate through
    PII detection results. When a `continueToken` is present in the response, include
    it as a query parameter in the next GET request to retrieve the next batch of
    entities. When `continueToken` is absent from the response, all results have been
    retrieved and pagination is complete.
