notes:
- If you intend to use our API directly for card payments without Secure Fields then
  you will have to go through your own PCI-DSS level 1 certification.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Allows for direct updates to specific fields on a transaction resource.
- Updating metadata is a replace operation, not a merge.
- You will need a private key to authenticate with the API. You can generate one in
  the Integrations section of your dashboard.
- Please set this to your own production or sandbox URL.
- Set this to the RSA private key you prefer to use.
- The thumbprint, or key ID, for the private key is visible in our dashboard.
- Not all payment services support decoded Google Pay tokens, and they may require
  this feature to be activated.
- Google Pay can be integrated both on the web and in Android applications.
- This endpoint requires the `transactions.read` scope.
- Supports optional locale for label in local language.
- Recommends using Secure Fields for card payments to reduce PCI scope.
- Approval may be needed for cards to facilitate 3-D Secure, and for non-cards to
  get the buyer to grant account payment authentication.
- This endpoint requires the `payment-options.read` or `embed` scope.
- The API handles authentication using a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) which is passed
  in an HTTP header.
- Token generation can only be done server side and we do not recommend doing this
  client side as it will expose your API key to your customers.
- Checkout sessions expire after 1 hour by default.
- Ensure you have internet access added to the permissions in your manifest
- Use JWT for authentication.
- The instance ID is the unique identifier for your deployment of our system and is
  included in every API call.
- Only the security code can be captured when using Secure Fields with a stored payment
  method.
- Attempting to add any fields other than security code will result in an error.
- Ensure your design meets accessibility standards set by the European Accessibility
  Act (EAA).
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Generating a checkout session can only be done server side.
- Do not expose your private key to client-side code.
- Card data stored in a checkout session can be used to create a transaction.
- To optimize 3-D Secure it is highly recommended to provide a buyer with billing
  details attached to Embed.
- Highly recommended to provide a buyer with billing details attached to Embed.
- Not all payment services support external 3-D Secure data.
- Each connector handles sandbox testing and test PANs differently, so it may or may
  not be possible to use these PANs to test end-to-end in sandbox.

- CODE_INVALID - The user entered an incorrect OTP. An error message is also displayed
  on the OTP component.
- INVALID_CARD - The user entered incorrect card details, or the details of a card
  that is not one of the supported schemes.
- ACCT_INACCESSIBLE - The user’s account is temporarily not accessible.
- USER_NOT_RECOGNIZED - The user is not recognized by Click to Pay (typically when
  a user hasn’t signed in yet).
- UNKNOWN - An unknown error occurred. These are usually unrecoverable. For example,
  the Click to Pay library was not initialized due to an invalid parameter.
- RETRIES_EXCEEDED - The user has exceeded the maximum number of retries filling in
  their one-time password (OTP) and their profile is locked. An error message is also
  displayed in the OTP component. It is recommended to hide the Click to Pay component
  for the user at this point.
- SIGN_OUT_FAILED - When attempting to sign out via the “Not you?” link, it is possible
  that Click to Pay is not able to sign out the user. It is recommended to hide the
  Click to Pay component for the user at this point.
