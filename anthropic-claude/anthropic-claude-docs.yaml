notes:
- Streaming input mode is the preferred way to use the Claude Agent SDK.
- 'Single message input mode does not support: Direct image attachments in messages,
  Dynamic message queueing, Real-time interruption, Hook integration, Natural multi-turn
  conversations.'
- Permission modes provide global control over how Claude uses tools.
- Use default mode for controlled execution with normal permission checks.
- The SDK automatically handles loading the conversation history and context when
  you resume a session, allowing Claude to continue exactly where it left off.
- The SDK should run inside a sandboxed container environment for security and isolation.
- 'Recommended: 1GiB RAM, 5GiB of disk, and 1 CPU.'
- 'Recommended: 1GiB RAM, 5GiB of disk, and 1 CPU (vary this based on your task as
  needed)'
- An agent session will not timeout, but we recommend setting a ‘maxTurns’ property
  to prevent Claude from getting stuck in a loop.
- Default behavior is an empty system prompt for maximum flexibility.
- OAuth2 MCP authentication in-client is not currently supported.
- Slash commands provide a way to control Claude Code sessions with special commands
  that start with `/`.
- Understand and track token usage for billing in the Claude Agent SDK
- The Files API is currently in beta.
