auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.nintex.com/docs/nw-api-docs/auth/authentication:
  - 'All Nintex Workflow API calls require a bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header. Three token types are supported: personal access tokens tied to an existing
    user, service apps tied to a generated service user, or client apps authorized
    for specific resources on behalf of a user.


    To authenticate, add the Authorization header with format "Authorization: Bearer
    YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" to each API request. Personal access tokens are tied to an existing
    user, run under that user''s identity, have Developer access to the tenant, are
    valid for one year, and cannot use restricted query parameters.'
