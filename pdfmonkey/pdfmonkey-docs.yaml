notes:
- Including stylesheets based on their URL is only possible on a paid account.
- An exception is made for CSS hosted on our own servers.
- Frameworks like Bootstrap have enforced opinions when it comes to print styles.
- We recommend using libraries with a lighter touch.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You cannot insert data using the {{movieTitle}} syntax.
- If you're concerned about the time it takes to generate your PDF, using smaller
  image is a very good start.
- The smaller the images, the faster they are to load and thus, the faster your Document
  generation will be.
- Our recommendation is to favor formats that provide small images.
- PDFMonkey supports recent image formats like Webp and AVIF.
- Another good idea is using inlined SVG or data-uri images as they will not need
  to load.
- This technique uses JavaScript and is thus only usable on a paid account or during
  your 14-day trial.
- Avoid animations; otherwise the QR Code might not finish its animation before 'printing',
  resulting in an absent or incomplete QR Code.
- Fonts won't apply in header and footer due to CSS tab limitations.
- Fonts must be inlined as data-uri in header/footer content.
- Paid account only
- Documents including external fonts will fail on a free account.
- Channels are case-sensitive!
- Always make sure you paste Template ID in upper-case.
- You can change the size of your Document's pages in the Template Settings tab.
- Sizes are expressed in millimeters, if you need inches, 1 in = 25.4 mm.
- If you're defining header and/or footer in the settings, you will need to give them
  space by adding margin at the top and/or bottom of the Document.
- If you have a very simple document and just want nice margins around it, that's
  fine too.
- If you need to have a full-page background color or image, margin will reduce the
  'printed' content size and prevent the color/image from going border to border.
- If you are make a Powerpoint-like document and need each content page to fill an
  entire actual page using the pixel sizes listed above, don't use margin or it will
  mess it up.
- The current page number can only be displayed inside the header and footer content.
- In Powerpoint-like documents, page numbers can be inserted using CSS counters.
- Generating the Document upon creation can be done by setting the status to 'pending'.
- Attaching meta data can influence the generated filename.
- Always prefer DocumentCard unless you really need access to payload
- Store any data you need later on in meta instead of (or in addition to) payload
- The simplest way to force a page break to happen is using CSS.
- You can use the `page-break-before` property to define a class.
- You can apply this class to any element you want to insert a page break before.
- If you want to avoid a section of your document from being broken between pages,
  you can use the `page-break-inside` CSS property.
- For fixed content, replace accented and special characters with their HTML Entity
  counterpart.
- Header and footer advanced content accepts dynamic data but may require help from
  the entities filter for accented characters.
- Download URL is only valid for 1h, refresh to get new Download URL.
- JSON doesn't support values that include line breaks.
- Use 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' for authorization.
- By default a webp image will be created.
- You can set dimensions and choose background transparency when creating templates.
- Make sur that you're using the same variable name between your Template and the
  payload you send.
- If your Template contains `{{someVariable}}` the Document payload should contain
  this.
- Be careful that the response from the API call will be a DocumentCard and not a
  Document.
- You will not be able to sign in until your account is confirmed.
- The Document’s status can be either pending or generating when you receive the response
  to your creating request.
- You need to fetch the Document again in a loop until its status becomes success
  or failure.
- Don't use preview_url; it is not a download URL.
- All commands accept the -k or --api-key option to specify an API key.
- You can also set the PDFMONKEY_API_KEY environment variable.
- Forgetting to publish your template is a frequent mistake, especially when switching
  back and forth between Make and PDFMonkey.
- Using an external JS library will only work on a paid account.
