auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/fundamentals.html:
  - Token-based API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Token YOUR_API_KEY". File uploads require the same authorization method
    and user that will use the file ID, and file IDs are valid for 24 hours. The X-Idempotency-Key
    header is optional for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests and must not be reused
    after 24 hours; if a duplicate key is sent while pending, you receive a 409 Conflict
    and should retry after five seconds.
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/ratelimit.html:
  - 'All authenticated requests to pretix API are rate limited at 360 requests per
    minute, with the limit scope depending on the authentication method used: per
    device for device authentication, per organizer account for token-based authentication,
    or per organizer and OAuth application combination for OAuth. Rate limit violations
    return HTTP 429 with a Retry-After header indicating seconds to wait before retrying.'
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/tokenauth.html:
  - API token authentication is required for all requests to the pretix API. Include
    the token in the Authorization header with the format "Token {api_token}", where
    the token is a long alphanumeric string generated in the pretix dashboard and
    cannot be retrieved again after creation.
  - 'Token-based authentication uses team-level API tokens obtained from the pretix
    web interface. Send the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with
    each API request.


    To use an API token, include it in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests
    in the format: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN. The token is created at the
    organizer team level in the pretix web interface and inherits the permissions
    of that team.'
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/oauth.html:
  - 'Authorization header using Bearer tokens. Access tokens are obtained via POST
    /api/v1/oauth/token with grant_type and credentials, then sent as "Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token}". Refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens
    at the same endpoint with grant_type=refresh_token. Tokens can be revoked via
    GET /api/v1/oauth/revoke_token endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/resources/checkinlists.html:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters (both optional). The response
    includes count (total results), next (URL to next page or null), previous (URL
    to previous page or null), and results array. Stop paginating when next is null.
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/fundamentals.html:
  - Most lists are paginated with response fields count (total results), next and
    previous (URLs to next/previous pages, or null if unavailable), and results (list
    of objects, default 50 per page). You can specify a lower pagination size via
    query parameter, and navigate by following the next/previous URLs.
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/resources/organizers.html:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a page query parameter (default 1) to
    navigate results. The response includes count, next, previous, and results fields,
    where next and previous are null values or URLs to navigate pages; stop paginating
    when next is null.
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/resources/events.html:
  - This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination with response fields. The response
    includes count, next, previous, and results fields. Use the next field value to
    request the next page; when next is null, there are no more pages.
- information_source; https://docs.pretix.eu/dev/api/resources/subevents.html:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: query parameters `limit` (optional,
    controls page size) and `offset` (optional, controls starting position). Response
    includes `count` (total items), `next` (URL for next page or null), `previous`
    (URL for previous page or null), and `results` (array of items). Stop paginating
    when `next` is null.'
