- information_source; https://docs.agaveapi.com/agave-api/passthrough-requests:
  - API-Version, Client-Id, Client-Secret, and Account-Token headers are required
    for all requests. For multipart passthrough requests specifically, you must also
    include Passthrough-Method (e.g., "POST") and Passthrough-Path (e.g., "rest/v1.0/images?project_id=66738")
    headers to specify the target system's request method and path.
  - 'Authentication uses three required headers: Client-Id (your client identifier),
    Client-Secret (your client secret), and Account-Token (a provider-specific account
    token such as procore_account_token or quickbooks_online_account_token). Send
    all three headers with each request to the passthrough endpoint.'
  - 'Pass credentials via request headers: `API-Version`, `Client-Id`, `Client-Secret`,
    and `Account-Token`. These headers are required for all passthrough API requests
    to authenticate and authorize access to the Agave API.'
  - 'Passthrough requests require the following authentication headers: API-Version,
    Client-Id, Client-Secret, and Account-Token. Additionally, Passthrough-Method
    and Passthrough-Path headers specify the HTTP method and endpoint path for the
    request to the source system. For file uploads, pass form data in the request
    body along with these required headers.'
  - 'The Agave API requires four authentication headers with every request: API-Version,
    Client-Id, Client-Secret, and Account-Token. These credentials must be included
    in the request headers when making calls to the passthrough endpoint.'
