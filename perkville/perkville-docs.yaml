auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.perkville.com/developers/docs/v1/:
  - 'Authentication for Perkville v1 API uses Basic Authentication with registered
    Perkville email and password credentials passed with every request. All requests
    must use HTTPS protocol.


    To authenticate, encode the email and password as base64 in the Authorization
    header using the format "Authorization: Basic base64(email:password)".'
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with email and password credentials. The
    authenticated user must be a staff member of the requested business. Credentials
    are passed via the `-u` flag in curl (e.g., `-u admin@example.org`) which translates
    to an `Authorization: Basic` header with base64-encoded email:password.'
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Credentials are passed using the `-u`
    flag with the format `username:password` (in this case `employee@example.org`),
    which translates to an `Authorization: Basic` header with base64-encoded credentials
    in HTTP requests.'
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Credentials are passed using the -u flag in
    curl, which sends them as an HTTP Basic Auth header (Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)).
    The username appears to be an email address (employee@example.org format) associated
    with an admin of the applicable business.'
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are passed via the `-u` flag in
    curl (or as HTTP Basic Auth header), using the format `username:password` where
    the username is a user email address. The authenticated user must have appropriate
    access permissions relative to the USER_ID being queried.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.perkville.com/developers/docs/v2/:
  - Pagination uses keyset-based pagination with datetime ranges. Request parameters
    include business_id (required), and either (from_datetime, to_datetime) or (last_mod_from_datetime,
    last_mod_to_datetime) with NO offset. Retrieve the next page by using the last_mod_dt
    or transaction_dt value from the previous page's final record as the new from_datetime
    or last_mod_from_datetime in the next request.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters in the query string. The response
    includes a meta object with limit and offset fields. Use the offset value from
    the response to construct the next request; increment offset by the limit value
    to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Requests on resources returning multiple items use offset-based pagination with
    a default page size of 20 items. Use the query parameter limit to set a custom
    page size and offset to skip records, for example GET https://api.perkville.com/v2/businesses/?limit=10&offset=10
    skips 10 records and returns 10 items. Note that offset=0 starts from the first
    record.
  - Requests returning multiple items are paginated to 20 items by default. Use the
    limit query parameter to set a custom page size for returning more or fewer items.
