auth_info:
- information_source; https://webapi.mymarketing.co.il/api/docs/Guides:
  - Authentication uses a bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization" with the value "[API Token]" (your actual API token)
    in all requests to the API at http://webapi.mymarketing.co.il/.
  - 'Authorization token passed in the Authorization header. The header format is
    Authorization: [token], where [token] is your authorization key. API key can also
    be passed as a query parameter named apikey.'
  - Use basic authentication by adding an Authorization header to requests with a
    token value obtained from the web interface (Settings > API apps). Tokens can
    be restricted to specific IPs and given expiry dates, and multiple tokens can
    be created as needed.

    should be included in the request header as ''Authorization: [token]''. Additionally,
