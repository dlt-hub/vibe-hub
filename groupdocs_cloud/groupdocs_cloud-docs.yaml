auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.groupdocs.cloud/conversion/overview/:
  - The GroupDocs.Conversion Cloud API uses OAuth2 with JWT tokens for authentication.
    Developers must register to obtain a Client Id and Client Secret, then exchange
    these credentials for a JWT token. Authenticated requests require a Bearer authorization
    header containing the JWT token.
- information_source; https://docs.groupdocs.cloud/total/authenticating-api-requests/:
  - Access tokens have a default lifetime of 1 day and are obtained from the /connect/token
    endpoint, which returns an expires_in value to indicate expiration. The endpoint
    enforces rate limiting with a maximum of 20 failed requests per minute, after
    which a 10-minute cooldown is imposed and the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests
    status code with a Retry-After header. Clients must implement token refresh logic
    to renew tokens before expiration or handle 401 Unauthorized responses to trigger
    new token requests.
  - 'JWT authentication using OAuth 2.0 client_credentials workflow. Obtain a JWT
    access token by sending client_id and client_secret to the authentication server,
    then include the token in the Authorization header for all subsequent API requests.


    Key details: Use client_id and client_secret to request a JWT token from the authentication
    server. Send the JWT token in the Authorization header of API requests to access
    restricted resources. The server validates the token signature using HMAC SHA-256
    before granting access.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain an access_token using
    application credentials, then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    ACCESS_TOKEN" for all API requests. The token has a 24-hour expiration (expires_in:
    86400). You can access files from all storages in your account by specifying query
    parameters like storage or storageName.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 with JWT Bearer Token is the only authentication method. The JWT token
    must be included in the Authorization request header. The token is a base64url
    encoded JSON object with three parts separated by periods: header.payload.signature,
    where the header contains signature type and encryption algorithm metadata, the
    payload contains claims about the entity and token metadata, and the signature
    provides cryptographic verification of authenticity.'
