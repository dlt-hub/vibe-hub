auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.expediagroup.com/docs/fraud-prevention/api/authentication:
  - Expedia Group travel platform APIs use OAuth2.0 token-based authentication. To
    acquire a token, make a request to a special endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth with
    your client ID as username and client secret as password. Then include the acquired
    token with each API request for authorization. Tokens are opaque and include client
    identity, assigned scopes, creation time, and expiration.
  - Use HTTP Basic Authentication with client ID and secret as username and password
    to POST to https://api.expediagroup.com/identity/oauth2/v3/token with grant_type=client_credentials.
    This returns a token valid for 30 minutes that must be supplied in subsequent
    API requests; missing, invalid, or expired tokens result in HTTP 403 errors.
- information_source; https://developers.expediagroup.com/docs/products/rapid/lodging/content/content-pagination:
  - The API uses a custom HMAC-based authentication scheme. Credentials are passed
    in the Authorization header with the format "EAN APIKey={apiKey},Signature={signature},timestamp={timestamp}",
    where the signature is computed using a shared secret and the apiKey and sharedSecret
    are provided during client initialization.
- information_source; https://developers.expediagroup.com/rapid/lodging/content/content-pagination:
  - The API uses a custom signature-based authentication scheme. Credentials must
    be sent in the Authorization header with the format "EAN APIKey={apiKey},Signature={signature},timestamp={timestamp}",
    where the apiKey and sharedSecret are provided to construct the signature, and
    the timestamp is included in the request. The sharedSecret is used to generate
    the signature value.

  : - 'Access tokens obtained through a prior OAuth2 or token acquisition flow must
      be included in the Authorization header of every API request using the Bearer
      scheme: Authorization: Bearer {token}. Tokens should be stored securely in-memory,
      never exposed to users, and transmitted only over TLS via server-to-server communication;
      the token contents must not be parsed as they are subject to change.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.expediagroup.com/docs/products/rapid/lodging/content/content-pagination:
  - Pagination uses Link headers with rel="next" containing the URL for the next page.
    Continue following each returned Link header until no further Link header is returned,
    which signals the end of the dataset. The Link header includes an expiration time
    and must be followed before that time expires.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination via HTTP Link headers. The response contains
    the first page of results with a Link header pointing to the next page URL. Follow
    the Link header URL to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Use the `Link` response header to paginate through property data. The header contains
    a link to the next page of results; follow this link to retrieve subsequent pages
    until no `Link` header is present in the response.
- information_source; https://developers.expediagroup.com/rapid/lodging/content/content-pagination:
  - Pagination uses Link headers with rel="next" containing the URL for the next page.
    Follow each returned Link header until no further Link header is returned, which
    signals the end of the dataset. The Link header expires at a specified time and
    must be followed before expiration.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination via the Link response header. The initial
    request returns the first page of results, and the Link header contains a URL
    with a token parameter that should be followed to retrieve the next page.
