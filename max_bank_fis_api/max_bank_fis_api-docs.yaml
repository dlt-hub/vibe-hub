auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc.maxbanka.eu/fis-rest-docs-psd2/:
  - API key authentication is required, sent via the API-key header. Additional headers
    include TPP-Name (application name) and TPP-Identification (TPP legal identity).
    The API also uses JWT tokens with client_id and scopes (aisp, pisp) for authorization,
    with token expiration managed via iat and exp claims.
  - 'API key authentication is required, sent via the API-key header. The API-key
    header must contain the authentication token (example: gHB1rYARCiWI69exnTCL3uHVOhxY2w5mmuamjQHJfmpqrI9JmxPP9AWskgnnvchW).
    Additionally, TPP-Name header is required to identify the Third Party Provider.'
  - API key authentication is required. Credentials are obtained via POST to /oauth2/register
    with a client certificate in the X-ClientCert header, and the response returns
    a client_id and api_key that must be used for subsequent requests.
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `API-key` header with
    each request. Additional headers include `TPP-Name` for the third-party provider
    name and `TPP-Identification` for identification, along with standard headers
    like `X-Request-ID`, `User-Involved`, `Accept-Language`, and `Date`.
  - API-key authentication is required, passed as the API-key header with the value
    gHB1rYARCiWI69exnTCL3uHVOhxY2w5mmuamjQHJfmpqrI9JmxPP9AWskgnnvchW. Additionally,
    TPP-Name and TPP-Identification headers must be included in requests, where TPP-Name
    is the third-party provider name (e.g., "Aplikace - PSD2API DOKUMENTACE") and
    TPP-Identification is the TPP legal identity.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://doc.maxbanka.eu/fis-rest-docs-psd2/:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (defines page number), size (defines
    page size), sort (defines sort field), and order (defines sort direction). Response
    structure includes paginated account data, though specific response fields for
    navigation are not detailed in the provided excerpt.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0) and size (number of results
    per page). The request example shows page=0&size=10, indicating offset-based pagination
    where page is the page number and size is the page size.
  - The standing orders endpoint supports query parameter pagination with page and
    size as optional parameters to control which page and how many results per page
    are returned. Sorting is available via the sort parameter with order parameter
    accepting asc or desc values.
