notes:
- Pinwheel makes it easy for your customers to securely connect both payroll and billing
  accounts through your application.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Automated Direct Deposit Switches may not be possible due to an error with the connection
  or when the user's employer has disabled the action.
- Link SDK version must be upgraded to 2.0 or later.
- If multi-factor authentication is enabled on the user's account, user action is
  required to complete the login step.
- Webhook events must be subscribed to for updates on direct deposit settings.
- Link SDK must be version 3.0 or later to enable the credential-less platform matching
  feature.
- Webhook events must be subscribed to in order to receive updates on direct deposit
  switches.
- The `action` field of Link event `input_allocation` is optional in the new SDK version.
- Link tokens are single-use and expire after 15 minutes.
- Parsed data is currently only available for W-2 documents.
- Link SDK must be upgraded to version 2.0 or later.
- To use the latest functionality, upgrade to API version v2025-07-08.
- It is not necessary to pass end_user_id when creating Link tokens for on-demand
  updates, as the information persists from the initial connection.
- Ensure to use API Key for authentication in the x-api-secret header.
- Webhook events provide updates on employment and income data.
- API and Webhook Version v2025-07-08 is required.
- In the cases where Automated Bill Switching is not available, Pinwheel provides
  users with instructions on how to complete the switch.
- The use of Bill Navigator requires version v2025-07-08 or higher.
- Enable Product transactions
- Request 730 days of data for proper recurring transaction analysis
- The `onSuccess` callback handler is executed on success of both direct deposit switches
  and bill switches.
- Multiple switches can be executed within a single Pinwheel link flow.
- Requires upgrading to version v2025-07-08 or higher.
- The `solution` field must be set to 'Switch Kit'.

- Requires setup of API secret for authentication
- Requires API secret for authentication
- Link tokens are single-use and expire after one hour.
- All requests must be sent via HTTPS.
- API keys are only valid for the mode they were created in.
- Pinwheel will occasionally sunset old API versions, which means they will no longer
  be available for use.
- Making a request to a sunsetted version will result in a 400 Bad Request error.
- There is a limit of ten active keys.
- Scheduled key rotation is a security best-practice.
- Pinwheel uses cursor-based pagination
- Any account data you receive from us includes the user ID you provide.
- The download_url is only active for 15 minutes.
- Document uploads require Link SDK version 2.3 or later.
- Webhook events notify when data is available.
- Pending outcomes indicate a job will retry up to 24 hours.
- Link tokens are intended to be single-use and expire after one hour.
- Some platform integrations may require camera access for verification purposes.
- The Web SDK is appropriate for implementing Pinwheel in your web app.
- The React SDK is appropriate for implementing Pinwheel in your web app.
- If the user has multi-factor authentication enabled on their account, user action
  may be required to complete the login step.
- Currently we ignore changes to whitespacing and character casing.
- In Sandbox mode, jobs with a pending outcome will transition to an error outcome
  60 seconds after the Link flow is completed.
- In Production, jobs may remain in pending for up to 24 hours.
- Contact sales@pinwheelapi.com for access to our Dashboard.
- Webhook endpoints must be https:// so that the event payloads can be transmitted
  securely.
- There is a quota of 10 registered webhooks per API key.
- Pinwheel signs all webhook events that it sends to your endpoints.
- This guide is for banking platforms that wish to add Pinwheel's Deposit Switch solution.
- The SDK implementation is recommended for the best user experience.
- The 'customer_id' must be sent in the 'tags' object when creating a Link token.
- Webhook endpoints must be https:// to transmit event payloads securely.
- Recommended to use SDK implementation for better user experience.
- SSO/SAML implementation can limit usability due to isolation.
- Customer ID must be immutable and used for billing and customization.
- Do not use PII for end_user_id.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Pinwheel
- Test users use sandbox mode
- Required customization involves specifying the name of the customer's organization
  or app for display in the Link modal.
- SSO/SAML implementation may be less work but has limitations in user experience.
- SDK implementation is recommended for better user experience and real-time feedback.
- Requires configuration of customer ID in tags for link token requests.
- Sandbox PreMatch flows currently only simulate successful flows.
- Some sandbox credentials reference Pinwheel products that do not apply to Direct
  Deposit Switch and can be ignored in your testing.
- The easiest way to implement Smart Branch is through a Pinwheel-hosted domain.
- This is a paginated endpoint
- Pinwheel is also happy to work with customers to host the experience on their chosen
  domain.
- API keys are valid only for the mode they were created in.
- Direct deposit webhook events will notify you when new direct deposit allocation
  data is available.
- Use account_id as the main identifier.
- List all completed jobs which were initiated by Link (i.e., excluding refresh jobs
  for monitoring). This is a paginated endpoint.
- Tax forms webhook events will notify you when new tax forms data is available for
  a payroll account or a tax forms job completed.
- Income and Employment webhook events will notify you when the data for a given product
  is ready to be retrieved.
- If `pending` outcome, another webhook will follow with `outcome` as `success` or
  `error` within 24 hours.
