auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.tempo.io/financialmanager/latest/integrating-cost-tracker:
  - All Tempo REST APIs use OAuth authentication. Machine-to-machine access tokens
    are required for REST endpoints and expire after 60 days, requiring renewal. Refer
    to the OAuth 2.0 authentication documentation for token acquisition and usage
    details.
- information_source; https://help.tempo.io/timetracker/latest/rest-api-integrations:
  - 'Authorization header with API key. Send the header `Authorization: Apikey <API_KEY>`
    where the API key is a long alphanumeric string like `T/6r47/KrnOPGqrtyI3aP/KAxnUsJBj7PzdkAqpvl6ijegFscT3pPqWf2pVRWSmL`.'
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods for accessing export endpoints: sending
    an HTTP header "Authorization: Apikey KEY" or including a query parameter "Apikey=KEY".
    Basic authentication is also supported using Apikey:KEY as username:password.
    The KEY credential is obtained from General Configuration Settings.'
  - 'The Time Tracker REST API requires an API key for authentication. The API key
    is passed via the Authorization header with the scheme "Apikey" followed by your
    key value (format: Authorization: Apikey YOUR_APIKEY). The Apikey is obtained
    from General Configuration Settings and is derived from your Jira URL and encoded
    user information.'
- information_source; https://help.tempo.io/timetracker/latest/jira-worklog-api-migration:
  - 'Jira REST API v3 supports two authentication methods: Basic authentication using
    a username and API token, or OAuth 2.0. For Basic auth, send credentials as base64-encoded
    "username:api_token" in the Authorization header. For OAuth 2.0, obtain an access
    token and send it as "Bearer <access_token>" in the Authorization header.'

- information_source; https://help.tempo.io/timetracker/latest/jira-worklog-api-migration:
  - Use startAt and maxResults query parameters to paginate through worklogs. The
    fields.worklog object returns maximum 20 worklogs per issue; for all worklogs,
    use the dedicated worklog endpoint with startAt and maxResults parameters.
