notes:
- Failure handling strategy lets you decide what happens if your HTTP Request runs
  into a problem.
- The only limitation is your imagination.
- Once a flow is deleted, it cannot be restored.
- Just apply with 'Apps' and 'AI Agents & Chatbots'
- When unpublish, this will deactivate it and stop all automated actions and access.
- Vector cannot properly embed images, tables, or graphs within these documents.
- Some pages/URLs may block the crawl function and may return a status of “rejected.”
- Allows you to monitor all your flows and have informations on it.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Absolutely.
- We host our AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) on our own cloud servers in the US
  (AWS and Azure), so your data isn’t sent to external LLM providers. This ensures
  privacy for tasks like extracting data from emails or documents.
- We comply with GDPR and CCPA by default, with SOC2 Type II and HIPAA available for
  Enterprise plans.
- Input components enable you to gather data from the user of your flow and integrate
  various types of media, including text, images, videos, and audio.
- With the Cronjob component, you can schedule timed execution of the flow.
- Supports various events such as new email received, new attachment, etc.
- This Branch component has no advanced configurations.
- It converts data from multiple sources into a unified JSON format.
- The Web scraper component allows you to collect and extract information from a web
  address using a URL.
- This component provides a convenient way to convert your document files into plain
  text.
- Enable caching option determines whether the results of the component are cached.
- Converts structured JSON data into spreadsheet formats like CSV or Excel.
- Loop node supports up to 100 runs per session. If the data exceeds 100, it stops
  at the 100th run.
- The File Creator node lets you quickly generate a new file in your chosen format.
- Supported formats include .docx, .pdf, .txt, xlsx, csv, .json, .html, .md.
- The generated QR code can be exported in different file formats (PNG, JPG, SVG)
  and output as either an image or a file.
- Calls a sub-flow synchronously during the parent flow’s execution.
- Passes selected inputs from the parent to the sub-flow.
- User can view the history of the subflow
- Last updated 21 days ago
errors:
- If something goes wrong, the workflow stops right here.
- If this request fails, just move on and keep the workflow going.
- Give it another shot! You can set how many times to retry and how long to wait between
  each try.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- This node is not available in sub-flow
- This flow cannot be marked as a sub-flow if nodes 'Run another flow', 'Branch',
  'Delay', 'Loop' are being used
