notes:
- This will give you all projects with all their configurations, all catalog items
  and the applied DQ checks.
- The REST endpoints follow a pattern using a fixed base path (/api/rest) on the default
  port (8051) and use basic HTTP authentication.
- DQ&C does not hold data; only metadata.
- GraphQL is not an appropriate tool for tabular data access.
- The latest version of RDM (14.3) includes a new feature called RDM REST APIs which
  enables reading data from RDM without requiring any additional configuration.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Ataccama
- Performance may degrade with large datasets
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- AI-powered data lineage with automated discovery and visualization.
- Secure edge processing capabilities to protect data.
