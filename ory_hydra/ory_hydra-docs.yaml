auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs-omega-six.vercel.app/docs/hydra/reference/api:
  - OAuth 2.0 Client configuration uses the `client_secret_basic` authentication method.
    Send the OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the URL path parameter `id`, and include the `client_secret`
    in the request body when setting or updating a client; the secret is returned
    in the response but cannot be retrieved later.
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Use basic auth (client_id and client_secret
    as credentials) or OAuth 2.0 bearer token. For token revocation, send client_id,
    client_secret, and token in the request body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    data. A token may only be revoked by the client that generated it.
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is used with Dynamic Client Registration. The registration_access_token
    string is sent when creating a client and can be used to update, get, or delete
    the OAuth2 Client. Token lifespans are configurable via refresh_token_grant_access_token_lifespan,
    refresh_token_grant_id_token_lifespan, and refresh_token_grant_refresh_token_lifespan
    parameters using time duration format (e.g., "1h", "30m"). Request Objects must
    be signed using the algorithm specified in request_object_signing_alg. Redirect
    URIs and post-logout redirect URIs are required for the OAuth 2.0 flow.
  - OAuth 2.0 client configuration with token endpoint authentication. The token_endpoint_auth_method
    field specifies the authentication method used when the client exchanges credentials
    at the token endpoint, with "client_secret_basic" indicating HTTP Basic Authentication
    using client credentials. The scope field defines space-separated OAuth scopes
    (e.g. "scope1 scope-2 scope.3 scope:4") that the client can request. The client_secret
    is generated or provided during creation and returned in the response but cannot
    be retrieved later.
  - OAuth2 JWT Bearer Grant Type authentication is supported. Clients authenticate
    using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) signed by a trusted issuer. The JWT must include
    required claims such as scope (e.g., "openid", "offline") and subject (e.g., "mike@example.com"),
    with the issuer's public key specified via kid and set URL for verification.
