notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Feast provides a python SDK as well as an optional hosted service for reading and
  writing feature data.
- Requires setup of connected app in Feast
- Some features may not be available for all entities at all times
- Feast provides a python SDK as well as an optional hosted service for reading and
  writing feature data to the online and offline data stores.
- Uses materialize_incremental to serialize new features since the last materialize
  call.
- Supports vector databases integration
- Allows for document processing and transformation into structured data
- Feast currently does not support any access control other than the access control
  required for the Provider's environment.
- Feast uses Great Expectations as a validation engine
- Uses Google Cloud BigQuery for data storage and retrieval
- Requires Feast Python SDK and Great Expectations for data validation
- Verify that all expectations that we coded in our profiler are present here.
- Validation successfully passed as no exception were raised.
- Validation failed since several expectations didn't pass
- Trip count (mean) decreased more than 10% (which is expected when comparing Dec
  2020 vs June 2019)
- Average Fare increased - all quantiles are higher than expected
- Earn per hour (mean) increased more than 10% (most probably due to increased fare)
- Simplifying vector database configuration and management
- Providing a consistent API for both writing and reading embeddings
- Ensure your Milvus instance is properly configured and running
- Vector dimensions and similarity metrics can be adjusted in the feature store configuration
- MCP support has been enabled for the Feast feature server
- Tests are organized by which Feast component(s) they test.
- Integration tests require external resources, while unit tests run locally.
- If you would like to run your own Redis cluster, you can run the above commands
  with your own specified ports and connect to the newly configured cluster.
- In development mode a self-signed certificate can be generated for testing.
- In production, it is recommended to obtain a certificate from a trusted TLS provider.
- Feast uses an internal type system to provide guarantees on training and serving
  data.
- 'Currently supports eight primitive types: INT32, INT64, FLOAT32, FLOAT64, STRING,
  BYTES, BOOL, and UNIX_TIMESTAMP.'
- Modular, backend-agnostic DAG execution framework
- Supports point-in-time joins and large-scale materialization
- Feast reads all Python files recursively when 'feast apply' is ran, including subdirectories.
- This is an experimental feature.
- This is an experimental feature. While it is stable to our knowledge, there may
  still be rough edges in the experience.
- This is an experimental feature. To our knowledge, this is stable, but there are
  still rough edges in the experience.
- SQLite is in limited access and only working on Python 3.10.
- The `retrieve_online_documents` method will be deprecated in the future.
- Experimental feature with rough edges.
- Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a Feast module aimed to help users to validate
  their data with the user-curated set of rules.
- Currently, Feast supports only Great Expectation's ExpectationSuite as dataset's
  profile.
- Python 3.12+ required
- Kafka cluster (local or remote) OR docker installed
- Local integration tests require Docker setup.
- Full integration tests require cloud environment setups.
- Your GCS_STAGING_LOCATION should be in the form gs://<bucket name> where the bucket
  name is from step 2.
- Make sure you have a Personal Access Token or retrieve your saved personal access
  token.
- 'Feast 0.10 introduces local mode: Local mode allows users to try out Feast in a
  completely local environment (without using any cloud technologies).'
- 'Feast comes with opinionated defaults: As much as possible we are attempting to
  make Feast a batteries-included feature store that removes the need for users to
  configure infinite configuration options.'
- Only a single offline store can be used at a time.
- Offline stores are not compatible with all data sources; for example, the BigQuery
  offline store cannot be used to query a file-based data source.
- The Feature Server is a REST API server that serves feature values for a given entity
  key and feature reference.
- Features can be loaded from data sources into the online store through materialization.
- The materialization is now constructed via unified compute engine interface.
- A Compute Engine in Feast is a component that handles materialization and historical
  retrieval tasks.
- Providers orchestrate various components (offline store, online store, infrastructure,
  compute) inside an environment.
- Feast has three built-in providers (local, gcp, and aws) with default configurations
  that make it easy for users to start a feature store in a specific environment.
- Feast does not provide authentication capabilities; it is the client's responsibility
  to manage the authentication token.
- Authorization configuration must be consistent between Feast servers and clients.
- Deploy Feast with metrics enabled
- The registry is a file but can be turned into a more scalable SQL-backed registry.
- Uses current timestamp for batch scoring
- Materializing feature views into the online store requires an active connection
  to the online store.
- Experimental Web UI for browsing features, data sources, entities, and feature services
- Feast supports primarily time-stamped tabular data as data sources.
- Ingesting from batch sources is only necessary to power real-time models.
- Ingestion from stream sources happens via a Push API or via a contrib processor
  that leverages an existing Spark context.
- Push sources allow feature values to be pushed to the online store and offline store
  in real time.
- Push sources can optionally have a batch_source specified.
- Online features can be sourced from batch, streaming, or request data sources.
- This approach can lead to quick impact for different business use cases, but it
  suffers from stale data.
- RBAC ensures that only authorized users or groups/namespaces can access or modify
  specific resources.
- Add On-demand transformations support
- Add Data quality monitoring
- Add Snowflake offline store support
- Add Bigtable support
- Add Push/Ingestion API support
- Ensure Feast Serving is compatible with the new Feast
- Decouple Feast Serving from Feast Core
- Add FeatureView support to Feast Serving
- Update Helm Charts (remove Core, Postgres, Job Service, Spark)
- Add Redis support for Feast
- Add direct deployment support to AWS and GCP
- Add Dynamo support
- Add Redshift support
- The Feast online store is used for low-latency online feature value lookups.
- Feature values are loaded into the online store from data sources in feature views
  using the materialize command.
- The storage schema of features within the online store mirrors that of the data
  source used to populate the online store.
- Only the latest feature values are stored per entity key. No historical values are
  stored.
- Feast uses offline stores as storage and compute systems.
- Offline stores store historic time-series feature values.
- Feast does not generate these features, but instead uses the offline store as the
  interface for querying existing features in your organization.
- Providers are built to orchestrate various components (offline store, online store,
  infrastructure, compute) inside an environment.
- The Feast Python SDK is used as a library to interact with a Feast deployment.
- The Feast CLI is a command line implementation of the Feast Python SDK.
- Default prefix to Feast environmental variables is 'FEAST_'
- Default directory to Feast configuration file is '.feast'
- Default Feast configuration file name is 'config'
- Default section in Feast configuration file to specify options is 'general'
- Some operations are idempotent and will not create new entries if the specifications
  do not change.
