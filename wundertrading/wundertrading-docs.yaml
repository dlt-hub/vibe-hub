auth_info:
- information_source; https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/bitget-api:
  - Bitget API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Include your API key
    in the request header, create an HMAC-SHA256 signature using your API secret,
    and provide a passphrase. The code example shows the authentication setup requires
    api_key, api_secret, and passphrase credentials, with signature generation using
    hmac and hashlib libraries.
- information_source; https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/bybit-api:
  - 'Bybit API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Requests require four
    custom headers: X-BAPI-API-KEY (your API key), X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP (current millisecond
    timestamp), X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW (request validity window in milliseconds, e.g.
    5000), and X-BAPI-SIGN (HMAC-SHA256 hex digest of the concatenated string timestamp+API_KEY+recvWindow+params).
    The signature is computed using your API secret as the HMAC key. API keys are
    generated in account settings with configurable permissions (read-only or trading)
    and IP restrictions. The API secret is displayed only once during creation and
    must be stored securely.'
- information_source; https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/crypto-trading-api:
  - 'The API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Send requests with three
    headers: X-API-KEY containing your API key, X-API-SIGNATURE containing an HMAC-SHA256
    hex digest of a message formatted as ''timestamp={milliseconds}'' signed with
    your API secret, and X-API-TIMESTAMP containing the current Unix timestamp in
    milliseconds. Store API_KEY and API_SECRET as environment variables rather than
    hardcoding them.'
- information_source; https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/okx-api:
  - 'All private endpoints require three authentication parameters sent as headers:
    OK-ACCESS-KEY (your API key), OK-ACCESS-SIGN (a signature created using your secret
    key), and OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE (your passphrase). API keys are generated in the
    API Management section of account settings and come with granular permissions
    (Read for account/market data access, Trade for order management, Withdraw for
    fund transfers). Public endpoints and WebSocket channels do not require authentication,
    while private WebSocket channels require the same API credentials.'
