auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sas.com/docs/rest-apis/getting-started/usage-notes:
  - SAS Viya REST APIs require OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Pass the access
    token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>" on all API
    requests; requests without a valid token will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
    Authorization is also enforced per operation, so a token may grant read access
    via GET but not write access via PUT or DELETE.

  - OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required for all API calls. Pass a valid
    OAuth2 token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>". Without a valid
    token, requests return a 401 Unauthorized response. The API uses OAuth2 tokens
    to authorize specific operations, such as read access via GET or write/delete
    access via PUT/DELETE methods.

  - OAuth2 bearer tokens are required for all API requests. Pass the token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <token>". Without a valid OAuth2 token, requests
    fail with a 401 Unauthorized response. Authorization is enforced per operation,
    so a user may have permission for GET requests but not PUT or DELETE requests
    on the same resource.
