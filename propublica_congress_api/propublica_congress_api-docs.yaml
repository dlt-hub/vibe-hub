    per day.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/campaign-finance/:
  - The Campaign Finance API uses offset-based pagination. The offset query string
    parameter controls pagination, with a default of 20 results per request; set offset
    to multiples of 20 to page through results. Date-based responses and aggregate
    totals return all results without pagination.
- information_source; https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/bills/:
  - Pagination uses offset and num_results fields. The response includes num_results
    (number of results returned) and offset (starting position), allowing clients
    to construct subsequent requests by incrementing the offset parameter to retrieve
    additional pages of bill search results.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with num_results and offset fields in the
    response. Request the next page by incrementing the offset parameter in subsequent
    calls; stop when the number of returned bills is less than num_results.
  - This endpoint returns the 20 most recent results and supports paginated requests
    using offset parameter. The response includes num_results and offset fields to
    track pagination state, where offset indicates the starting position of results
    returned.
  - Use offset and limit query parameters for pagination. The response includes num_results
    (total count), offset (current position), and results array. To get the next page,
    increment offset by the desired limit value.
