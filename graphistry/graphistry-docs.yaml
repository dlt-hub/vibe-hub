auth_info:
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/api/2/rest/curl-tutorial/:
  - Authentication uses username and password credentials sent as JSON in the request
    body to the /api-token-auth/ endpoint. The response returns a token value that
    must be extracted and subsequently used as the GRAPHISTRY_TOKEN environment variable
    for authenticated requests. Send credentials as JSON fields "username" and "password"
    in the POST request body to obtain the token.
  - Authorization uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Set the Authorization
    header to "Bearer ${GRAPHISTRY_TOKEN}" where GRAPHISTRY_TOKEN is an environment
    variable containing your authentication token. This token is required for POST
    requests to /api/v2/files/ and /api/v2/upload/files/{FILE_ID} endpoints.
  - Graphistry uses JWT tokens for API authentication. To obtain a token, send a POST
    request to /api-token-auth/ with a JSON body containing username and password
    fields. The returned JWT token should then be included in subsequent API calls
    for authentication and authorization. The token grants access to the corresponding
    user account, so token transmission should be carefully controlled depending on
    whether it is used by a server or client application.
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/api/1/rest/auth/:
  - Use your account credentials to obtain a short-lived JWT token (approximately
    1 hour validity). Include the token in HTTP requests as an Authorization header.
    Tokens can be refreshed by exchanging for a new one, but full credential re-login
    is required daily as tokens are valid for exchange only up to 24 hours.
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/api/2/rest/sso/:
  - Admin-restricted single-use token authentication for external dataset access.
    Admins call GET /api/v2/generate/single-use-url/?username=any_username&dataset_id=DATASET_ID
    with Bearer token authorization header to receive a magic login URL containing
    a one-time sesame token passed as query parameter sst. External users access the
    URL to gain temporary dataset-scoped access. Token configuration uses SESAME_TOKEN_NAME
    (default sst), SESAME_MAX_AGE (default 3600 seconds), and SESAME_ONE_TIME (default
    True for single-use enforcement). Admins revoke access via GET /api/v2/logout-user/username/.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/UDF/gfql-udf-api/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit (optional) controls the
    number of results per page, and offset (required) specifies which page to view.
    The response includes a count field for total UDF endpoints and a next field containing
    a link to the next page (or null when no more pages exist).
  - Use limit (optional, integer) and offset (required, integer) query parameters
    to paginate results. Response includes count (total number of endpoints), next
    (string or null with link to next page), previous (string or null with link to
    previous page), and results array containing UDF endpoint objects. Construct subsequent
    requests using the next/previous links or by adjusting offset and limit parameters.
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/UDF/py-udf-api/:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter `limit` (integer, controls results per
    page) and required query parameter `offset` (integer, specifies page to view).
    Response includes `count` (total UDF endpoints) and `next` (string or null, likely
    indicates next page URL).
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter `limit` to specify results per page and
    required query parameter `offset` to specify the page number. Response includes
    `next` and `previous` fields containing links to navigate pages, and `count` field
    with total number of results.
- information_source; https://hub.graphistry.com/docs/api/2/rest/upload/:
  - Offset-based pagination is used for listing datasets. The request accepts optional
    query parameters limit (integer) and offset (integer). The response includes count
    (total number of datasets), next (URL to next page or null), previous (URL to
    previous page or null), and results array containing dataset objects. Use the
    next/previous URLs or construct new requests with updated offset values to navigate
    pages.
