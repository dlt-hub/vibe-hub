notes:
- Uses Nebius AI Cloud CLI for resource management.
- Open WebUI must be started manually unless configured to start automatically.
- Nebius uses binary units. For example, a gibibyte (GiB) is 230 (10243) bytes.
- You do not need to create a user data configuration in advance if you create a VM
  in the web console.
- InfiniBand in the cluster allows you to accelerate tasks that require high-performance
  computing (HPC) power.
- Preemptible VMs only support the FAIL value that stops the VM.
- Removing the public_ip_address parameter creates a VM without a public IP address.
- Uses binary units, e.g., gibibyte (GiB) is 230 (10243) bytes.
- 'Warning: After creating the VM, mount additional disks or filesystems; otherwise,
  they will not be recognized.'
- Preemptible VMs do not provide guaranteed availability.
- Dynamic IP addresses are released when a preemptible VM stops.
- By default, a VM with a dynamic public IPv4 address is created.
- If you do not assign a public address to your VM, the access to the container is
  restricted.
- Boot disks are unavailable for containers over VMs. Only additional disks are available
  in advanced settings.
- If you do not stop VMs on time, the service will stop them compulsorily after the
  due date. This may cause the VMs to become unstable.
- Do not stop your VM by using Linux commands, such as `shutdown` or `halt`. Compute
  considers this as a failure, reboots the VM automatically and continues charging
  for this VM.
- When a VM assumes the Error status, delete this VM and create a new one.
- Stopping a VM does not release quotas.
- Unattended upgrades are disabled by default.
- Private addresses are allocated from subnets with the 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16
  IPv4 CIDR blocks.
- Dynamic public IP addresses are not persistent and will return to the IPv4 public
  range after one hour if the VM is stopped.
- The tutorial includes chargeable resources like Compute virtual machines and Compute
  disks.
- Each GPU cluster is created in one of physical InfiniBand fabrics.
- All virtual machines added to the GPU cluster must be in the same project.
- Nebius AI Cloud provides object storage through a separate service.
- A VM and its volumes must be located in the same project.
- For GPU VMs, only recommended images are available when you create a VM with a new
  boot disk in the web console.
- If you add a disk, you always need to mount it manually.
- You can detach a secondary disk or a shared filesystem from a VM. You cannot detach
  a boot disk.
- One disk can be used on one VM at a time.
- Data for the dashboard is collected automatically.
- The VM usage data becomes available 5–10 minutes after the VM is created.
- By default, the data is refreshed every 15 seconds.
- Serial logs are kept for 14 days.
- Logs for deleted instances are also kept for 14 days, but cannot be seen in the
  web console.
- The volume usage data becomes available 5–10 minutes after the volume is mounted.
- By default, the data is refreshed every 15 seconds. You can configure this interval
  to the right of the time filters.
- Sometimes, demand for virtual machines and GPUs in certain Nebius AI Cloud regions
  might be higher than the available supply.
- Availability of platforms and presets differs by region and project.
- For new VMs, use the recommended boot disk image 'ubuntu22.04-cuda12' to prevent
  CUDA initialization issues.
- If you connect to your virtual machine (VM) and shut it down by using Linux commands,
  the VM is not stopped properly.
- All prices are shown without any applicable taxes, including VAT. Due to rounding
  errors, usage costs shown in the web console and final charges may slightly differ
  from calculations based on the prices in this article.
- Soperator clusters are provisioned with all necessary software pre-installed and
  ready to use.
- The configuration of the Slurm cluster is also fine-tuned and does not require additional
  setup on your side.
- Managed Service for Soperator is available in 'eu-north1' and 'us-central1' regions.
- You can create a maximum of one Soperator cluster in each of your projects in 'eu-north1'
  and 'us-central1'.
- Each cluster supports up to 4 worker nodes with a total of 32 GPUs.
- You can create a maximum of one Soperator cluster in each of your projects in the
  eu-north1 and us-central1 regions.
- While the cluster is stopped, charges apply for the cluster's storage resources.
- The restart takes around 15 minutes.
- By default, if a cluster has several login nodes, you connect to a random login
  node.
- If you use the tmux terminal multiplexer, make sure to connect to the same node
  each time.
- Batch jobs are limited in time and non-interactive.
- Files and dependencies that you set up on the login node automatically appear on
  other nodes.
- All nodes share a root filesystem, so files and dependencies that you set up on
  the login node automatically appear on other nodes.
- The job runs on three nodes with 8 GPUs each.
- Loads all environment variables into the job.
- Slurm clusters share a root filesystem.
- Job runs on three nodes with 8 GPUs each
- You can run containerized jobs with batch scripts by using special srun options.
- The squeue command doesn't list completed or failed jobs.
- Rsync is not intended for transferring large files.
- Rclone is a versatile tool for downloading large amounts of data (10-100 TiB) fast.
- AWS CLI can be used for downloading smaller amounts of data (no more than 10 TiB).
- Only users with administrator privileges can create and delete other users.
- This method of viewing metrics applies to Pro Solution for Soperator and to Soperator
  clusters that you self-deployed in Nebius AI Cloud.
- Do not modify Managed Service for Kubernetes nodes in Compute. Use the Managed Service
  for Kubernetes® section instead.
- New clusters use Kubernetes version 1.31.
- Kubernetes version 1.30 is not recommended (it is reaching end of life).
- It is not currently possible to set a Kubernetes version for a node group in the
  web console.
- The Kubernetes version for a node group must not be higher than for the control
  plane.
- High availability is enabled by default for clusters.
- The public endpoint is allocated by default for clusters.
- Maximum number of nodes per node group is 100.
- 'The deployment strategy field, .spec.strategy, includes the following fields: .spec.strategy.max_unavailable,
  .spec.strategy.max_surge, .spec.strategy.drain_timeout.'
- The maximum amount of time it can take to drain a node during the update is specified
  by .spec.strategy.drain_timeout.
- To ensure connectivity, the control plane subnet and the node group subnet must
  belong to the same network. Their CIDR blocks can be different.
- Reserve at least one more public IP address than the total number of nodes in the
  group.
- To retain the allocated public IP address and reuse it in future, convert the system-managed
  allocation into a persistent one and manually link it to your service by using an
  annotation.
- The configuration of these add-ons is not exposed via API and there are only limited
  options to customize them.
- Do not use helm upgrade to customize, as the changes it makes may be rolled back
  immediately.
- Uses NodeLocal DNSCache for improved DNS performance in Kubernetes clusters.
- If the tests don't show the expected metrics increase, there may be an error in
  your configuration.
- Check that the local redirect policy is enabled in the Cilium configuration.
- Check that the node-local-dns local redirect policy is properly applied.
- Check the local redirect policy rules on any of the Cilium pods.
- Check the contents of the resolv.conf file in the dnsutils pod.
- Check DNS logs.
- To enable logs for pods running DNS services, create a custom ConfigMap.
- To enable logs for the node-local-dns service, edit the ConfigMap.
- Pods can pull images from Container Registry without additional authentication if
  a service account is added to the node group.
- You cannot change the VM platform and preset or the GPU cluster of an existing node
  group. Create a new node group instead.
- If you need to modify the NVIDIA device plug-in, omit the --template-gpu-settings-drivers-preset
  parameter.
- Select a platform and a preset compatible with GPU clusters.
- In `--template-gpu-cluster-id`, specify the GPU cluster ID.
- The average bus bandwidth is not equal to the InfiniBand one as some of the NCCL
  operations it measures use NVLink.
- Persistent volumes keep files for the lifetime of the pod.
- A disk can be used on one node at a time. Use shared filesystems for data sharing.
- The filesystem that you are adding to a node group must be located in the same project
  as the node group's parent cluster.
- Do not omit `nofail`. If it is not specified and a node cannot find the filesystem
  on restart, the node will not boot.
- Each application requires at least one node group in a cluster.
- Node groups created with an application remain in the cluster after deletion and
  are subject to charges and quotas.
- If you have a GPU node group with autoscaling, add a CPU node group with at least
  two nodes.
- Quota for IP addresses is exceeded
- Selected subnet is too small
- CIDR block is too large
- The bucket name must be unique across the region.
- If the bucket has versioning enabled, it may appear empty but still contain old
  versions of some objects.
- When an object is deleted from a bucket in Object Storage, it becomes immediately
  inaccessible and cannot be restored. The actual object data is then physically deleted
  from Nebius AI Cloud servers within 4 days.
- You can only add lifecycle rules to existing buckets.
- When you update the settings of a bucket, make sure to list all lifecycle rules,
  even the ones that you do not change.
- 'The commands support moving data in the following directions: From other storage
  providers to Nebius AI Cloud, and between buckets in Nebius AI Cloud.'
- AWS CLI does not support uploading objects to a storage class that differs from
  the bucket's default.
- The bucket usage data becomes available 5–10 minutes after the bucket is created.
- Object Storage has quotas on buckets and storage size for your tenant.
- Ensure you have postgresql package installed to connect to your cluster.
- Do not use spaces in cluster names.
- To manage clusters, install the Nebius AI Cloud CLI.
- The service currently supports only version 16.
- The transaction mode offers a limited support of PostgreSQL features; not all PostgreSQL
  clients are compatible with this mode.
- The session mode does not limit the number of PostgreSQL features that you can use.
- You don't automatically switch to a new database after creation.
- Do not delete the default database, as this may cause the service to malfunction.
- To connect from the internet, use the public cluster endpoint. You can connect from
  the internet only if you enabled public access to the cluster when you created it.
- To connect from other Nebius AI Cloud resources, use the private cluster endpoint.
- Do not routinely work with the cluster as the bootstrap user. Create other users
  with the necessary privileges and leave the bootstrap user as a fallback in case
  of emergency.
- Change the password for the bootstrap user only via Nebius AI Cloud interfaces (web
  console, CLI and provider for Terraform).
- The migration is only possible if the PostgreSQL version in the source cluster is
  the same as in the target cluster.
- The pg_dump and pg_restore utilities have the same version.
- The major version of the utilities must be greater than or equal to the PostgreSQL
  version in the target cluster.
- The external PostgreSQL cluster should be running version 10 or higher.
- Ensure that incoming connections are allowed for the external PostgreSQL cluster
  from the internet.
- You cannot change the backup settings after you create a cluster.
- Managed PostgreSQL supports the Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) technology.
- Public access to clusters is free of charge.
- 'Service is available in all regions: eu-north1, eu-west1 and us-central1.'
- Run the Nebius AI Cloud Docker credential helper to use Nebius AI Cloud registries
  without running the `docker login`.
- Access tokens have a lifetime of 12 hours.
- By default, the static key lifetime is 6 months.
- Set up authentication in Container Registry on your machine.
- Together with the cluster, Managed Service for MLflow creates a bucket in Object
  Storage to store the experiment logs and metrics. This bucket is not deleted automatically
  after you delete the cluster.
- Each Managed MLflow cluster uses 6 vCPUs, 24 GiB of RAM and a 200 GiB Network SSD
  disk.
- Managed MLflow cluster and its resources count towards the quotas throughout the
  cluster's lifecycle, from its creation to deletion.
- Applications in the Standalone Applications service in Nebius AI Cloud deploy their
  own infrastructure.
- Availability depends on the region of the selected project.
- Deleting your data is a permanent action.
- To keep the data and save costs, you can stop the application instead.
