notes:
- Epoch is validated and must not be older than 5 mins.
- Header secrets must be encrypted using AES256 each time the API is consumed.
- Same key used for both payload and header secrets encryption.
- Responses are encrypted only if successful.
- Keys are client-specific.
- The Data Provided is for visualization purpose only.
- This supports JSON and array of JSON for decryption.
- Any file in the payload should be passed as-is without encryption.
- API User Name and key will be provided by the ISU team.
- Any missing or invalid mandatory field will generate a Failed response.
- The date and time stamp present across all endpoints in the document is in UTC timestamp
  format.
- The system will automatically send callbacks with updated transaction data to the
  registered endpoint.
- Agent have total three attempts (one OTP verification and two OTP resend requests),
  the agent will be restricted from further attempts for the next 24 hours.
- During Staging Integration, client will receive the OTP through API response (backend),
  not in mobile number.
- bcagentid,mobilenumber ,aadhar_no and pancard are unique.
- Special character should be allowed for address, area, Shop address, Shop area,
  Shopname, and companyname.
- Middle space should be allowed for address, area, Shop address, Shop city, Shop
  district, Shop state, Shop area, Shopname, and companyname.
- As per the guidelines of NPCI on 'FIR-FMR single PID block implementation in Aadhar-based
  biometric authentication, we need to capture the fingerprint data of our end-user
  with an updated PID fType value.
- In order to capture finger data, you needs to pass value of fType = 2 rather than
  0; this will return PID XML with the updated fingerprint data format and same can
  be passed over in the API.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- header_secrets and pass_key are to be shared during integration by ISU Team.
- Uses AES-256 encryption for secure data transmission.
- Critical to implement the exact encryption and decryption logic provided by iServeU.
