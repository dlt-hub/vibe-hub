  - 'FoxyCart API uses OAuth 2.0 with refresh token flow. To obtain a new access token,
    POST www-form-url-encoded data to https://api.foxycart.com/token with parameters:
    grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token={refresh_token}, client_id={client_id},
    and client_secret={client_secret}. An OAuth Client must be created first to obtain
    the client_id and client_secret credentials.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication with Bearer tokens. Pass the `access_token` in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>". Store the `client_full_access`
    scoped `refresh_token` and OAuth Client ID/Secret securely to enable token refresh
    and future OAuth requests.'
  - OAuth2 Bearer token authentication is required. After client creation, use the
    access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". The access_token
    expires in 7200 seconds; use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token. Store
    client_id and client_secret securely as they are master credentials for OAuth
    requests. The scope provided is "client_full_access".
