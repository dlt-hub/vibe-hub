auth_info:
- information_source; https://coinlib.io/apidocs:
  - API key authentication is required via the `key` query parameter. Include your
    API key as a query parameter in every request to any endpoint (e.g., `?key=YOUR_API_KEY`).
    Do not use multiple API keys simultaneously, and issue requests sequentially to
    avoid 429 rate limit responses.
  - 'API key authentication is required. Pass the API key as the `key` query parameter
    in the request URL. For example: `https://coinlib.io/api/v1/coin?key=YOUR_API_KEY&symbol=BTC`.
    The `key` parameter must be included in all requests to the endpoint.'
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as the `key` query parameter
    in requests, for example `https://coinlib.io/api/v1/coin?key=XXX&pref=EUR&symbol=BTC`.
    Each API call consumes quota against your account, with remaining quota returned
    in the response as `remaining`.
  - 'API key authentication is required. Pass your API key via the `key` query parameter
    in requests to endpoints like `/coinlist`. Example: `https://coinlib.io/api/v1/coinlist?key=XXX&pref=BTC&page=1&order=volume_desc`.'
  - You need an API key for all API calls. Get your API key from your profile page
    at https://coinlib.io/profile after creating an account and logging in. The API
    key should be sent with each request to endpoints under https://coinlib.io/api/v1.
    All API endpoints use GET requests. Rate limits are enforced per endpoint per
    hour, and each response includes a remaining field indicating how many requests
    you can make until the next hour begins. The rate limit is 120 requests per hour
    to the endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://coinlib.io/apidocs:
  - The `/coinlist` endpoint uses query parameter `page` (integer, starting from 1)
    for pagination, returning 100 results per page by default, though this may change
    without warning.
