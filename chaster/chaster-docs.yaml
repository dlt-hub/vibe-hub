auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.chaster.app/api/basics/getting-started:
  - OAuth 2 authentication is required. Obtain credentials via developer token (generated
    from developer interface, linked to your Chaster account) or OAuth 2 access token
    (for any user). Client ID and client secret are provided when you create an application
    on the developer interface. Use the obtained token to authenticate requests to
    the Public API.
- information_source; https://docs.chaster.app/api/extensions-api/authentication:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Generate a token from the developer
    interface under "Tokens" section, then include it in the Authorization header
    as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for all API requests. Keep the token secret
    as it grants full API access on your behalf.'
  - To authenticate with the Chaster Extensions API, use a bearer token in the Authorization
    header. Generate a developer token from your Developer interface by navigating
    to your application and selecting "Tokens" in the left sidebar. Include the token
    as a bearer token in requests to endpoints starting with /api/extensions.
- information_source; https://docs.chaster.app/api/extensions-api/changelog:
  - Basic HTTP authentication is available for webhooks. When configuring a webhook,
    provide a username and password to enable Basic HTTP authentication for webhook
    requests.
- information_source; https://docs.chaster.app/api/extensions-api/create-your-extension/main-page:
  - 'The extension uses a token-based authentication scheme where a main page token
    is passed in URL hash parameters to your web application, which must then pass
    this token to your backend to make authenticated requests to the Extensions API
    endpoints.


    To implement: extract the mainToken from the hash parameter using JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.substring(1))),
    then include this token in requests to the Extensions API (specifically in requests
    to GET /api/extensions/auth/sessions/:mainToken as documented in the authentication
    documentation). The token is only retrievable by your web application and must
    be used server-side for all API requests.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.chaster.app/api/extensions-api/sessions:
  - Pagination uses a `paginationId` field from each result to navigate through extension
    sessions. Include the last `paginationId` from the previous response in subsequent
    requests to fetch the next set of sessions.
  - The endpoint POST /api/extensions/sessions/search uses cursor-based pagination
    with limit parameter. Request body includes limit (default 15, controls batch
    size) and paginationLastId (optional, pass the paginationId from previous results
    to fetch next batch). Response contains hasMore boolean indicating more results
    exist, count for total matching sessions, and results array where each item has
    paginationId to use in next request's paginationLastId field.
