notes:
- Automates API security testing with real-world attack simulations
- Integrates seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous protection
- Pynt's API Security Testing is fully available for Business plan users, and limited
  for Starter plan users (up to 10 API endpoints)
- Before running Pynt scans, ensure your environment is correctly set up with the
  required system configurations, permissions, and tools for a smooth and successful
  API security scan.
- If you're running Pynt locally, ensure Docker is installed and running.
- 'If using Pynt locally, make sure Python is installed on your machine. minimum Python
  version: 3.9'
- Verify that app.pynt.io is reachable from the machine running Pynt.
- Pynt requires Docker access and doesn’t support the Postman web interface.
- Ensure your functional test collection is available, your environment variables
  are set, and the target application is running.
- 'If you''re integrating Pynt with Postman, ensure you''re using the Postman app
  (note: Pynt requires Docker access and doesn’t support the Postman web interface).'
- For several integrations, Pynt uses your existing functional tests (Postman, Newman,
  CLI) to drive its security scans.
- Pynt's container allows you to run Pynt from any location, supporting deployment
  in local or on-premises.
- Pynt authentication is not implemented yet
- PYNT_ID must be exported as an environment variable as Pynt authentication is not
  implemented yet
- Ensure you run the install.sh script as a non-root user
- Pynt offers comprehensive API security testing by leveraging real-world attack simulations
  and homegrown tests.
- These tests align with OWASP Top 10 for APIs.
- Ensure that the API endpoint is accessible and properly configured.
- Verify API authentication credentials.
- Check server logs for details.
- Verify that all functional tests are set up correctly and integrated.
- Check the error code explanations below for quick diagnosis.
- Detect and prevent sensitive data exposure with Pynt’s AI-powered analysis.
- Identify PII and data leaks across API environments with automated security testing
  and flow tracking.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Pynt integrates with API testing tools like Postman and ReadyAPI through their CLIs.
- Pynt integrates seamlessly into popular testing frameworks.
- Pynt integrates seamlessly into any CI/CD pipeline, enabling automated API security
  testing at every stage of the development process.
- Run pynt listen and set it to capture the domains of the traffic that you want Pynt
  to scan.
- Pynt allows DevSecOps teams to implement automated PenTests within the CI/CD pipeline
  in just a few clicks.
- To configure Burp Suite to use an upstream proxy, enter the IP address of Pynt listen
  127.0.0.1 and port number 6666.
- Pynt's API Catalog is available for Pynt's Business Plan users only.
- Pynt's Applications View is part of Pynt's enterprise plan.
- Easily navigate your scan history in Pynt to review past security assessments and
  track the progress of your API security over time.
- Effortlessly browse for a specific API security scan with Pynt!
- Explore our guide on navigating through scan history to find and review particular
  scan.
- Pynt allows seamless integration with JIRA for API vulnerability reporting.
- Single Sign-On is only available for customers with a paid plan.
- Pynt supports most SAML 2.0-based identity providers.
- Make sure Python installed on the agent.
- Pynt's API Catalog is part of Pynt's enterprise plan.
- Add Pynt to your workflow.
- The Code Repository source category will be officially supported.
- Effortlessly enhance your API catalog with Pynt!
- Effortlessly view source information in Pynt to gain detailed insights into your
  API security setup.
- Security is a key focus of Azure API Gateway, offering features such as OAuth 2.0,
  Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration, and built-in threat protection to ensure
  that your APIs are secure from unauthorized access and threats.
- GCP API Gateway offers robust features such as OAuth 2.0, JWT authentication, and
  IAM integration
- Security is a cornerstone of Gravitee, with built-in features such as OAuth2, OpenID
  Connect, JWT authentication, and IP filtering.
- The applications view serves as a central hub for managing your applications to
  meet your API security needs.
- Access the applications view conveniently from the left menu pane.
- Pynt supports live traffic integrations to continuously discover and assess APIs
  in real-time.
- By connecting to traffic sources like eBPF and AWS Traffic Monitor, Pynt detects
  active API endpoints and security risks without requiring manual input.
- Integrating Pynt with GCP API Gateway enhances the discovery, security, and management
  of your APIs within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
