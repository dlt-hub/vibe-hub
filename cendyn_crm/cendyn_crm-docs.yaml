auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.pushtech.com/api/authentication:
  - The API uses token-based authentication via HTTP header. All requests require
    the Authorization header with format 'Token token={{account_master_secret}}' for
    account requests or 'Token token={{app_token}}' for app requests, where the token
    value is base64-encoded credentials or a secret token depending on the request
    type.
  - Token-based authentication is required for protected resources. Pass the account
    secret or account master secret in the Authorization HTTP header with the format
    "Token token=<secret>", where the secret is a base64-encoded string combining
    account credentials. Each HTTP request to a protected resource must include this
    Authorization header.
