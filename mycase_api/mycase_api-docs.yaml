  - 'All API endpoints require HTTP bearer authentication using an access token in
    the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Access tokens
    are valid for 24 hours and can be refreshed using a refresh token (valid for 2
    weeks) by sending a POST request to `https://auth.mycase.com/tokens` with client_id,
    client_secret, refresh_token, and grant_type set to `refresh_token` in the request
    body. The response provides a new access_token. A 401 Unauthorized response indicates
    the access token has expired.'
  - MyCase API uses OAuth 2.0 with the Authorization Code grant type. Applications
    must obtain client credentials from MyCase support, then redirect users to the
    authorization server with their client ID and redirect URI. After the user grants
    access, an authorization code is returned to the specified redirect URI. The application
    exchanges this code along with client credentials for an access token, which is
    then used to make authenticated API requests.
  - 'MyCase uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Step 1: GET request to https://auth.mycase.com/login_sessions/new
    with query parameters client_id (your OAuth Client ID), redirect_uri (pre-registered
    redirect URI), response_type set to "code", and optional state parameter for CSRF
    protection. Step 2: Exchange the authorization code for an access token via POST
    request to https://auth.mycase.com/tokens with client_id and client credentials
    in the request body. The authorization code is returned in the redirect URL as
    the code parameter after user grants access.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code grant flow is used. In the token exchange POST request,
    send client_id, client_secret, code, grant_type set to "authorization_code", and
    redirect_uri in the JSON request body. The response provides an access_token with
    token_type "Bearer" used for subsequent API requests, a refresh_token valid for
    2 weeks, and access_token expires_in 86400 seconds (24 hours).
