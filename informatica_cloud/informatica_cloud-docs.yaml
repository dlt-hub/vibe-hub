    body to the login endpoint, then extract serverUrl and icSessionId from the response
    to use in subsequent API calls.

- information_source; https://thinketl.com/introduction-to-snowflake-sql-rest-api-using-postman/:
  - JWT key pair authentication is required for SQL REST API requests. Generate a
    public-private key pair using OpenSSL, assign the public key to your Snowflake
    user account, and store the private key locally. The private key is used to sign
    JWT tokens that authenticate API requests. OAuth is also supported as an alternative
    authentication method.
  - 'Snowflake SQL REST API uses Bearer token authentication with JWT. Send the JWT
    token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" and include
    the header "X-Snowflake-Authorization-Token-Type: KEYPAIR_JWT" to specify the
    token type.'
  - 'Snowflake SQL REST API uses JWT bearer token authentication. Send the JWT token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <jwt_token>" and include the header "X-Snowflake-Authorization-Token-Type:
    KEYPAIR_JWT" to specify the token type. The Content-Type and Accept headers should
    both be set to "application/json".'
  - Snowflake SQL REST API uses Key Pair Authentication with JWT tokens. Generate
    a public-private key pair using OpenSSL, assign the public key to your Snowflake
    user, and store the private key locally. Generate a time-limited JWT token using
    the SnowSQL command with account identifier, username, and private key path. Send
    the JWT token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <jwt_token>" with each API
    request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://thinketl.com/snowflake-snowpipe-rest-api/:
  - The insertReport endpoint uses marker-based pagination. The beginMark query parameter
    (optional, returned from previous calls) is used to reduce repeated events. The
    response includes a nextBeginMark field that should be passed as beginMark in
    the next request to continue pagination. The completeResult boolean indicates
    when all results have been retrieved.
