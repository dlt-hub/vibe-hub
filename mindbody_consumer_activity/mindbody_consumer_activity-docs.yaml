pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.mindbodyonline.com/AffiliateDocumentation:
  - Pagination uses `maxResults` and `offset` query parameters. `maxResults` specifies
    maximum records to return (endpoint-specific values), and `offset` specifies records
    to skip (defaults to 0 if omitted). Responses include `offset`, `maxResults`,
    `totalResults`, and `items` fields to indicate pagination state and construct
    subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses offset and maxResults query parameters to control results. The
    response includes offset, maxResults, totalResults, and an items array containing
    records.
- information_source; https://developers.mindbodyonline.com/ConsumerDocumentation:
  - Use query parameter pageNumber (number type) to request specific pages. Response
    includes pageCount field indicating total number of pages. Continue paginating
    by incrementing pageNumber until reaching pageCount.
