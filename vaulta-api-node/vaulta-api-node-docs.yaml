notes:
- API nodes must enable the chain_api_plugin to expose the API endpoints.
- Push API nodes do not accept incoming p2p transactions.
- Chain API nodes maintain blocks log and accept both API and p2p transactions.
- Uses Vaulta Web IDE for building and deploying smart contracts
- Please make sure to never commit your .env file to a public repository, or use private
  keys in plain text in the config file.
- Creating an account requires RAM, which must be paid for by someone with an existing
  account.
- Current costs for opening an account is based on 2996 bytes of RAM.
- RAM is a limited resource and must be purchased or reclaimed.
- CPU and NET are consumed based on transaction execution.
- The PowerUp resource model allows renting CPU and NET for a specified period.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- It is preferable to use read-only actions to read data so that it can be returned
  in a structured way.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Vaulta
- Some actions may have rate limits
- NFTs are unique tokens that cannot be interchanged with another token.
- Uses ERC721 standard for NFTs.
- Account names also have the same limitations as table names, so they can only contain
  the characters a-z, 1-5, and .
- Performance considerations regarding string manipulation in smart contracts
- Warning about security checks in token event receivers
- Learn about Hyperion, a full history solution for Antelope chains.
- Transactions are created within an application by instantiating a transaction object
  and pushing the related action instances into a list within the transaction instance.
- The transaction must be signed by a set of keys sufficient to satisfy the accumulated
  set of explicit actor:permission pairs specified in all the actions enclosed within
  the transaction.
- Finality is a separate role tied to the authority of the top 21 block producers.
- Voting is continuous, try to keep your producer active between rounds.
- There is a voting history file.
- It is always safe to activate new, never used BLS keys.
- Be aware of vote routing topology and activate vote threads to relay votes.
- It is always safe to activate a new BLS finalizer key.
- Do not reuse BLS finalizer keys between hosts.
- Generate unique BLS finalizer keys for each nodeos instance.
- Keys are activated with an on-chain action, *keys must be pre-generated and registered*.
- '`safety.dat` must contain the full voting history for the BLS finalizer key in
  use.'
- No you should switch to a new BLS finalizer key, that is a much easier and safer
  way to continue voting.
- It is best to switch over to a new BLS key assuming that results in less voting
  downtime.
- The new token is denoted as 'A' with a precision of 4.
- The token swap contract is a drop-in replacement for the old system contract.
- Make sure you have set up your MetaMask wallet and connected it to the Vaulta EVM.
- Common issues are that you do not have enough balance in your wallet to pay for
  the transaction.
- Vaulta EVM's gas price is fixed. It is currently set at 150000000000.
- Currently the Vaulta EVM does not support the PUSH0 opcode. This means you must
  use a version less than 0.8.20 for your Solidity compiler.
- Inscriptions are only useful for indexing and other off-chain purposes until the
  data is written into state.
- The gas fee is fixed on Vaulta EVM.
- Your miner account does not deplete RAM resources as it relays transactions. It
  only consumes CPU and NET resources.
- All EVM transactions require a native token to cover the transaction fee.
- Due to a limitation in the Vaulta EVM Contract, Vaulta EVM currently supports a
  maximum of five (5) nested calls.
- EVM addresses that begin with twelve `0xbb` bytes are reserved for bridging EOS
  between native Vaulta and EOS within EVM.
- The `exponent` bit size cannot exceed either the `base` bit size or the `modulus`
  bit size.
- This opcode currently does not return the hash of the specified block contents,
  but the hash of the specified block height and the chain ID instead.
- This opcode currently returns 1 (one) by default since there is no hash difficulty
  in the underlying Vaulta consensus protocol.
- This opcode currently returns `0x7FFFFFFFFFF` (2^43-1) as the maximum gas limit
  in Vaulta EVM.
- The Vaulta EVM does not currently support `PUSH0`, so you need to use solidity version
  `0.8.19` or below.
- Some methods are deprecated or discontinued.
- Some methods are designed for the local node scenario. They are not exposed to the
  public API, however you can access them when you deploy your own Vaulta EVM node.
- Some methods involve complex logic, therefore more tests need to be performed before
  they will be exposed.
- Sending an array of request objects as the body to the JSON-RPC API is not currently
  supported. The server will return a 400 error in this case.
- 'The minimum, starting point, for an API node, without maintaining blocks log, is
  the following: CPU: 2 cores >= 3.7 Ghz, RAM: 16 GB RAM and 16 GB swap, HDD: 1024
  GB, Internet network link: 100Mb/s'
- Be aware, the above configuration will face problems if suddenly RAM usage on the
  network increases over that 32GB mark. Also, this setup is 50/50 RAM/swap and occasionally
  will respond slow on some requests due to swapping.
- 'The optimal configuration at the time of writing this document, June 12th 2023,
  for an API node without blocks log is: CPU: 4 cores >= 3.8 Ghz, RAM: 64 GB, HDD:
  1024 GB, Internet network link: >= 100Mb/s'
- For API nodes, in general, you do not want too high CPU speeds (>= 5 Ghz), since
  it will skew subjective billing lower and run into edge cases where the API thinks
  a transaction is fine, accepts it, tells the user success, and then the transaction
  ends up getting rejected upstream by a slower CPU.
- 'For state history node you need even more HDD space than the API node with blocks
  log: CPU: 4 cores >= 3.8 Ghz, RAM: 64 GB, HDD: 5120 GB, Internet network link: >=
  100Mb/s'
- One common, and most efficient strategy that applies to all nodes, is the use of
  the tmpfs files system. This strategy suggests to mount the node state folder into
  a tmpfs partition. This normally requires a large swap partition in addition to
  at least 32GB RAM.
- Plugins are essential for extending and modifying the functionality of a node.
- nodeos uses plugins to add incremental functionality to a node.
- Certain plugins are essential to the modular operation of nodeos.
- Peering allows Vaulta nodes to propagate and synchronize the distributed blockchain
  state.
- Peering allows Vaulta nodes to propagate and synchronize the distributed blockchain
  state by receiving and relaying blocks and/or transactions to other nodes.
- Peering is enabled through the Vaulta peer-to-peer (p2p) network protocol.
- A snapshot is a capture of the blockchain state at a specific point in time.
- It includes the sum of all changes that have occurred up until that point from transaction
  executions.
- The snapshot will be saved in the data/snapshots directory.
- 'Database dirty flag set (likely due to unclean shutdown): replay required'
- 'Could not grow database file to requested size: start nodeos with --shared-memory-size-mb
  1024 option'
- The chain_plugin is necessary for processing and consolidation of chain data.
- Retrieves analytics related to the blockchain, including free_bytes, used_bytes,
  size, and indices.
- The http_plugin is essential for enabling the RPC API functionality.
- This plugin exposes endpoints that allow management of p2p connections.
- Running this plugin on a publicly accessible node is not recommended as it can be
  exploited.
- To enable block production, a particular nodeos configuration is necessary.
- Refer to the Configuring Block Producing Node guide for detailed instructions.
- The local IP and port to listen for incoming prometheus metrics http request is
  set to 127.0.0.1:9101
- Limits the maximum time (in milliseconds) that is allowed for sending requests to
  a keosd provider for signing
- Establishes a socket connection to listen for incoming connections from applications.
- The plugin stores serialized block trace data on the filesystem.
