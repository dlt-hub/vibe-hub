Based on the provided information about the Invoicing API, here is the generated YAML configuration for the REST API source:

client:
  base_url: "https://api.invoicing.co/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"

resources:
  - name: "clients"
    endpoint: "/clients"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.clients"  # Assuming the response contains a "clients" array

  - name: "products"
    endpoint: "/products"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.products"  # Assuming the response contains a "products" array

  - name: "invoices"
    endpoint: "/invoices"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.invoices"  # Assuming the response contains an "invoices" array

  - name: "recurring_invoices"
    endpoint: "/recurring_invoices"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.recurring_invoices"  # Assuming the response contains a "recurring_invoices" array

  - name: "payments"
    endpoint: "/payments"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.payments"  # Assuming the response contains a "payments" array

### Explanation of the YAML structure:
1. **client**: Contains the base URL for the API and the type of authentication used (API key).
2. **resources**: Lists five main resources (endpoints) with their respective details, including HTTP method, endpoint path, and a JSONPath selector for parsing the response.
3. **notes**: Provides helpful annotations regarding authentication, rate limits, and pagination.
4. **errors**: Details common HTTP error codes that users might encounter.
5. **auth_info**: Mentions the requirement for an API key and its importance.
6. **source_metadata**: Offers a brief description of the API's functionality.

This YAML configuration is structured to facilitate easy integration and understanding of how to interact with the Invoicing API.
