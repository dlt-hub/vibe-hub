notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 11:11 requires that versions do not exceed the specified thresholds based on environment
  and solutions.
- Customer version must be at least Veeam Backup & Replication 12 P20230412 (build
  12.0.0.1420 P20230412).
- Veeam Backup & Replication v11 is out of support as of February 1, 2024.
- If Backup for M365 and DRaaS with Veeam are not the same version, M365 data is still
  backed up, but cannot be recovered through Veeam Explorer if the Explorer versions
  are different.
- Bandwidth up to 1g will be handed off via a 1g optic, bandwidth >1g will be handed
  off via a 10g optic.
- QoS is supported but with some limitations.
- 11:11 Cloud is a self-service cloud infrastructure, built on VMware vCloud and HPE
  powered technology and accessed through the 11:11 Cloud Console.
- Microsoft 365 data is automatically backed up daily.
- Customer is responsible for access and control of the data.
- If you have not yet purchased our Disaster Recovery Option, you will instead be
  shown a screen with more information about the offering, and how to purchase it
  if you are interested.
- Access LabEngine Classroom or Lab requires login credentials and access code.
- Users can switch between Guide view and Architecture view.
- 11:11 Systems is updating the billing system. Some details of the invoice and billing
  process may differ from this article.
- 11:11 Systems services are comprised of various products that can reach the end
  of their Product Life Cycle for a variety of reasons, such as innovation, development,
  and market demands.
- peering your Veeam Backup & Replication server with 11:11 to receive licensing requires
  a compatible version of Veeam
- Customers using the 11:11 rental licensing cannot contact Veeam directly for support
- Certain OVA files are unable to get uploaded using the 1111 Console. As a workaround
  you can extract the OVA contents into OVF files and upload them that way.
- When a VM is provisioned a default storage profile is associated with the VM.
- The deployment of your 11:11 Cloud typically takes 4-5 business days on average.
- Ensure the vApp containing the VMs is uploaded to a private catalog before exporting.
- Requires an IPsec capable device at both ends of the tunnel.
- Creates a tunnel that allows communication to and from any device on either side
  of the tunnel.
- Allows for the configuration of multiple tunnels to multiple locations.
- Backups occur daily (once a day)
- Users have unlimited storage quota
- Users have an unlimited retention policy
- Modern App Authentication Overview
- MSFT Basic Authentication going End of Life
- A Company Administrator is the only user type who can manage users.
- User passwords expire every 90 days.
- Users must be removed from backup jobs before purging the user.
- Currently only 2000 users can be uploaded per .csv file.
- Uses Modern App as the default authentication type.
- port 6180 needs to be allowed outbound for both TCP and UDP connections
- ports 80 and 443 need to be allowed outbound for TCP connections
- Peering your Veeam Backup & Replication server with 11:11 to receive licensing requires
  a compatible version of Veeam.
- The expiration date displayed is not the end date of your 11:11 Systems contract
  but the expiration date of the 11:11 license file used for your licensing services.
- MSP Identity Access Management (IAM) roles must be mapped into the platform for
  proper functionality.
- Ensure the port 6180 is open for outbound access on your firewall.
- You will need to ensure you have received the SSL Certificate from the Service Provider.
- Right now there is a limitation with Veeam Cloud Connect that will only allow one
  Tenant Console to Cloud Repository session.
- Most customers keep 7 days worth of backups with 1 full backup file and 6 incremental
  files.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with Direct Grant Authentication
- Burst environments are unmatched in simplicity and speed of deployment.
- You only pay for the resources you actually use.
- In a Burst environment, provided you understand and follow the import concepts already
  covered, there really isn't much else to managing your virtual infrastructure.
- Security is always a top priority, no matter the environment type. But, in a Burst
  environment, it is (if possible) even more important.
- You need to leave replicated data when removing a VM from a VPG.
- Select Yes when prompted to leave replicated data for later use.
- Enables data polling for monitoring in the 11:11 Console.
- 'Access Token Lifespan: 15 minutes'
- 'SSO Session Max: 10 hours'
- 'SSO Session Idle: 30 minutes'
- Log in to the 11:11 Cloud Console and create a user dedicated for the API calls.
- When creating your first VM, use one of the templates provided.
- Default setting denies all traffic not explicitly allowed by a rule on the Edge
  Gateway.
- All templates are configured to have remote access turned off at the time of deployment.
- A Company Administrator, or role with company level access to manage IAM, is the
  only user type who can manage users.
- You must add 11:11 as a service provider first to enable this option.
- Updated the UI and added new Microsoft API support for continued backup service
  of Microsoft Teams.
- Only MS Teams channel data is backed up, not direct messages.
- Utilizing the Microsoft Graph Export API for Teams comes at an additional cost from
  Microsoft.
- The Microsoft Graph Export API for Teams is currently not supported in Microsoft
  365 US Government, Germany, and China regions.
- Only public channel posts can be backed up and is only supported for Microsoft 365
  organizations with modern app-only authentication.
- Zerto Replicated Storage and Journal Storage are each a sum of hourly averages over
  a month.
- This estimate is only a tool to predict costs, the actual cost is as described in
  Billing.
- Ensure you have a Microsoft with appropriate permissions set up before creating
  backup jobs.
- When restoring a mailbox, you must first recreate the Microsoft Exchange account
  (if deleted), then restore the mailbox.
- Administrator access to S3 is provided with your Access Key ID and Secret Access
  Key pair from 11:11.
- Veeam 10 adds archival GFS retention to your local on premises backups.
- Veeam 10 introduces the Immediate Copy mode to backup jobs.
- Veeam can now hook into a SMB, NFS, Windows or Linux file share to back up the shared
  data.
- Purchasing additional AWS storage is not available in the Console. Contact support
  to purchase additional storage or to create or delete tenants.
- Creation of Recovery Groups (Failover Plans) is currently handled through the local
  (on-premises) Veeam Backup & Replication server.
- Use the old legacy link when making these changes at http://console.ilandcloud.com
- 11:11 Object Storage is 100% S3 API compatible.
- Access Credentials are tied to your Secure Cloud Console account.
- It is against best practices to write VM backups directly to cloud in any form,
  including object storage.
- If the object-lock box was checked during bucket creation then you must enable make
  recent backups immutable.
- While it is up to the customer due to the minimum retention requirement of S3 Standard-IA
  this should be set to a minimum of 30 days.
- EC2 checks are not permitted on the tenant AWS account, and it will result in failure.
- To continue getting updates you must confirm your access to Account app
- There are several ways of achieving connection to the DR environment, but some methods
  will fit business needs more than others.
- Templates built can be thought of as a vApp Template in VMware Cloud Director.
- Each template corresponds to a catalog in the 11:11 Console and both are synched.
- Only one Template can be used to deploy Labs in a Classroom.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Templates can be deployed in Classrooms or independent Labs.
- You can continually grow and scale out your environment.
- The Lab will also deploy with an auto-generated user that can be changed in the
  Lab page.
- You may need to refresh the page to view the latest status.
- Costs are static in Reservation style vDC.
- Billing totals are based directly on the amounts agreed to in the contract.
- Existing Microsoft Teams chat backups are disabled starting February, 2023 without
  the following change.
- Modern App Authentication overview is required.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in 11:11 Cloud.
- Each identity must have a strong, private, alphanumeric password to be able to access
  any service. Passwords must be between 14 and 25 characters and must contain one
  capitalized character, one lowercase character, one special character, and one number.
- Important! To improve support for Console service accounts dedicated to using the
  11:11 Cloud API, if you enforce the policy for all users, assign all Console API
  users these roles in order to avoid any service disruptions.
- Admin can provide users only Read permissions at the location level
- Admin can provide users only Read or Write permissions for Backup Jobs
