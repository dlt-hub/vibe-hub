notes:
- BAML-over-REST is currently a preview feature.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- HTTPResponses have a HTTPBody object. You must now call `.json()` or `.text()` to
  access the http response message.
- The BAML compiler generates a python client that imports and calls the function.
- BAML does have some limitations we are continuously working on.
- Developing requires VSCode.
- Environment Variables are stored in VSCode’s local storage! We don’t save any additional
  data to disk, or send them across the network.
- Requires setup of connected app in Boundary
- Be mindful of rate limits when querying data
- This auto-reload approach works best if you’re only making changes to the prompts.
- BAML integrates seamlessly with Go modules.
- Elixir support is unstable. Please see the note in the repository.
- To send logs and traces to Boundary Studio, you need to set the BOUNDARY_API_KEY
  environment variable.
- To enable logging, set the BAML_LOG environment variable.
- To truncate each log entry to a certain length, set the BOUNDARY_MAX_LOG_CHUNK_CHARS
  environment variable.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in boundary
- Some endpoints may return rate limit errors
- Committing a lot of audio files into your repository can make it slow to clone and
  pull your repository.
- If you expect to commit >500MiB of audio, please read GitHub’s size limit documentation
  and consider setting up large file storage.
- Committing a lot of Pdf files into your repository can make it slow to clone and
  pull your repository.
- If you expect to commit >500MiB of Pdfs, please read GitHub’s size limit documentation
  and consider setting up large file storage.
- Committing large video files into your repository can make it slow to clone and
  pull your repository.
- If you expect to commit >500MiB of videos, please read GitHub’s size limit documentation
  and consider setting up large file storage.
- BAML lets you stream in structured JSON output from LLMs as it comes in.
- Number fields are always streamed in only when the LLM completes them.
- Pdf inputs must be provided as Base64 data
- URL-based Pdf inputs are not currently supported
- Pdf inputs are only supported by models that explicitly allow document modalities
- Uses AbortControllers for cancelling operations
- Abort controllers allow you to cancel ongoing LLM operations, which is essential
  for user-initiated cancellations, implementing timeouts for long-running operations,
  cleaning up resources when components unmount, and managing multiple parallel requests.
- 'BAML provides two types of validations: @assert for strict validations and @check
  for non-exception-raising validations.'
- If you created your project using baml-cli init, then one has already been generated
  for you!
