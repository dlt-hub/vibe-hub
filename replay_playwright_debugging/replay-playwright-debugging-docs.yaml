notes:
- Prompts you to log in to your Replay account with Google (if not already logged
  in)
- Installs the Replay browser (if not already installed)
- API key required for authentication
- Automatically uploads recordings to DevTools
- To use your API key, you can either use dotenv package and save it to a .env file
  or add the API key to your environment directly.
- What happens on CI no longer stays on CI. Replay Browser captures your test runs
  exactly as they happened and brings them to Replay DevTools where you can inspect
  them.
- PR comment bot currently only listens to pull_request event.
- It’s possible to host your Replay data in the S3 Bucket or storage of your choice.
- It’s possible to specify a set of URLs which can be included or excluded from a
  Replay.
- Replay supports SSO integrations such as Okta and SAML 2.0.
- 'Make sure to set if: ${{ always() }} so that this step is always executed, even
  when the previous step fails.'
- Replay Chrome supports Linux x86, Mac x86, and Mac ARM.
- An experimental windows browser is in the works, but currently paused.
- Replay Firefox was our first runtime, so it’ll always have a special place in our
  hearts.
- Replay Firefox Windows has a 40% replay crash rate, so we only recommend trying
  it if you’re okay putting up with reliability issues.
- Replay Node is currently in an alpha state
- Be sure to add the `REPLAY_API_KEY` for the workspace to the build and deployment
  settings for your project
- We anonymize production data before using it for testing.
- Advanced Settings let you try experimental features, enabled diagnostics, and troubleshoot
  issues.
- Replay is just a browser, can use Playwright API to launch Replay browser.
- Uses API key for authentication — requires setup in GitHub secrets
- You can set REPLAY_API_KEY as an environment variable instead of passing to the
  upload-all command.
- This page includes common issues that you may encounter when using Playwright and
  Replay and some tips on how to troubleshoot them.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Recording an issue will help you capture the root cause.
- Replays are very effective when facing intermittent issues, race conditions, router
  problems, or any issue that either happens too quickly or is hard to identify.
- Replay records the entire browser session
- Replay is a debugger
- Replay records runtimes and automated tests
