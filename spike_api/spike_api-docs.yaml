  - Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signing with a shared secret key obtained from
    the administrative console. Generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the user ID using
    the secret key, then exchange it at the endpoint https://app-api.spikeapi.com/v3/auth/hmac
    to receive an access token. The secret key is stored as HMAC_KEY_FROM_ADMIN_CONSOLE
    and the user ID is signed using hmac.new(hmac_key, user_id.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest().
  - Spike API uses HMAC-based authentication. To obtain an access token, POST to https://app-api.spikeapi.com/v3/auth/hmac
    with a JSON body containing application_id, application_user_id, and signature
    (an HMAC signature generated to verify user authenticity). The response returns
    an access_token string for subsequent API requests.
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. After successful authentication, store
    the returned access_token (a JWT) and include it in the Authorization header as
    "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" for all subsequent API requests.'
  - The Spike API uses a three-step HMAC-based authentication flow. Step 1 involves
    generating an HMAC signature using a shared secret key obtained from the administrative
    console. Step 2 exchanges this signature for an access token via a dedicated endpoint.
    Step 3 requires storing and using the access token for subsequent API requests.

  - 'You''ll need to add a Bearer token into the Authorization header for all API
    requests. Include the token as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where {token} is
    your API credential.'
