auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/api/suse-manager/api/scripts.html:
  - Authentication uses a session cookie named `pxt-session-cookie` with a token hash
    value that must be passed in the `--cookie` header of requests. The session token
    is obtained through prior login and included as `pxt-session-cookie<tokenhash>;`
    in the cookie parameter of curl or requests calls.
  - The API uses cookie-based session authentication. After successful login to the
    auth/login endpoint, a session cookie named pxt-session-cookie containing a token
    hash is returned via Set-Cookie header. This cookie must be included in the Cookie
    header of all subsequent API requests for authenticated access.
  - The JSON over HTTP API uses authentication tokens sent as cookies. To authenticate,
    make a POST request to the auth.login endpoint with a JSON body containing login
    and password properties. The server responds with a pxt-session-cookie cookie
    that must be included in subsequent requests for authentication.
