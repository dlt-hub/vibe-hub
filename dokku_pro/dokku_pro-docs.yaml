auth_info:
- information_source; https://pro.dokku.com/docs/features/api/:
  - 'Token-based authentication using JWT. First, exchange username and password via
    HTTP Basic Auth (curl -u flag) with a POST request to the token endpoint, extracting
    the JWT from the response. Then use the JWT token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" for subsequent API requests.


    Key details: Initial authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with username and password
    credentials sent to the token endpoint. The response contains a JWT token in the
    data.id field. Subsequent requests require the Authorization header with format
    "Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}". Content-Type header should be set to application/json
    for requests.'
- information_source; https://pro.dokku.com/docs/features/api/openapi.yml:
  - Authentication is performed by exchanging basic auth credentials for an expiring
    JSON Web Token (JWT). Basic auth credentials are exchanged via the authentication
    endpoint to obtain a JWT token, which is then used for subsequent API requests.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}".
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.'
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header for requests to protected endpoints, as indicated by the security scheme
    "bearer_auth" applied to operations like updating HTTP auth settings and maintenance
    mode settings.
