  - 'API requests use Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header. The
    token is a JWT that includes user identity, environment, login, scopes (like "espf.api:write"
    and "espf.handlers:write"), expiration time, and realm information. Send the token
    as "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_token>" in the request headers.'
  - The PortaBilling API uses login-based authentication via the session/login method.
    Authentication is provided in the request body as a JSON object containing auth_info
    with login and password or login and API token. Upon successful authentication,
    the response includes access_token, expires_at, and session ID as both response
    body fields and cookies, which are then used in subsequent API requests.
  - To access the PortaBilling web server, send a POST request to /rest/Session/login
    with a JSON body containing login and password (or API token) in the params field.
    The response includes a session_id, access_token (JWT), refresh_token, and expires_at
    timestamp. Use the access_token in subsequent requests for authentication.
