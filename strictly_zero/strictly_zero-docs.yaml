auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.strictlyzero.com/:
  - API requests require two headers for authentication. The key-hash header must
    contain your API key (e.g., BL2H6LGNEUGSXTBARA59), and the Authorization header
    must contain a Basic auth value generated from your username and password encoded
    in base64 format (e.g., Basic base64(username:password)). All requests must be
    made over HTTPS. API keys should be kept secure and not shared publicly. View
    and manage keys in the Security Keys Dashboard at https://merchant.paywithzero.net/client/apps/merchant/key/list.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials should be sent in the Authorization
    header as a base64-encoded string in the format "username:password". The example
    shows "Integration@strictlyzero.com:Demo123" encoded as the auth credential. A
    401 Unauthorized response indicates missing or invalid API key or username/password.
  - To use the Strictly API, you must obtain an API key from the merchant platform.
    The API key is used to authenticate requests and determines whether the request
    operates in sandbox or production mode. The documentation does not specify the
    exact header name, parameter name, or method for sending the API key in requests.
