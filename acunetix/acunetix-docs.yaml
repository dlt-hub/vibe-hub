notes:
- Scanning production APIs should be conducted with care.
- Some scanning methods may result in data deletion.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Manual testing and detection of web vulnerabilities can be very time consuming.
- Automated Web Vulnerability Scanners (WVS) help with the detection of vulnerabilities
  in web applications.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in acunetix
- Some scans may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Flexible Packages, Transparent Pricing
- Web security solutions for small businesses, enterprise customers, pentesters, and
  web professionals.
- Joining the partner program is free and there is no upfront commitment.
- Requires setup of connected app in Acunetix
- Starting from Acunetix Version 12 (build 12.0.190325161), Acunetix marks some vulnerabilities
  as verified.
- Acunetix has proven itself and is worth the cost.
- AcuSensor works best in specific environments and is not recommended for some of
  the others.
- You should install AcuSensor on your staging servers.
- We do not recommend installing AcuSensor on production servers.
- AcuMonitor is a publicly accessible service.
- AcuMonitor payloads use TLS whenever possible.
- Requests made to AcuMonitor are stored for a limited amount of time (maximum 7 days)
  and then securely deleted.
- Acunetix integrates with API management systems and container management tools like
  Kubernetes.
- Acunetix vulnerability scanner offers its own API that you can use to connect to
  other security controls and software developed by third parties or in-house.
- Standard Support includes expert-level support for product functionality.
- Premium Support offers industry-leading response times and escalation for high severity
  tickets.
- Premium Support + Guided Success includes a named application security manager for
  guidance.
- Acunetix is renowned for its high performance and a low rate of false positives.
- Acunetix does not test WiFi security.
- Regular website security checks are crucial to ensure your web application does
  not expose sensitive data.
- Code reviews and manual tests aren’t exhaustive enough to find all security vulnerabilities.
- Web applications and APIs are treated as the external attack surface.
- Acunetix can scan hundreds of web applications and APIs.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Acunetix allows users to export vulnerability data to Issue Trackers such as Atlassian
  Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS), Bugzilla, and Mantis.
- The only sure way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is input validation and parametrized
  queries including prepared statements.
- It is a good idea to turn off the visibility of database errors on your production
  sites.
- CSRF attacks are only possible because cookies are automatically sent with each
  request.
- CSRF only applies to situations where a victim is able to perform actions that are
  not accessible to everyone.
- Ensure you have installed the latest version of your web server software.
- Effectively filter any user input to remove everything but known good data.
- Unlimited coverage. Pay for security, not arbitrary limits.
- Uses OAuth2 with access token required
- 404 – This is not the page you are looking for.
- Always align to the practices outlined in the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
  with the goal being to exceed minimum requirements at every turn
- Continue to provide transparency into how we proactively integrate accessibility
  principles into the design and engineering of our products
- This Policy does not apply when you purchase our solutions or when we process personal
  data on behalf of a customer.
- We do not use personal information for making any automated decisions affecting
  or creating profiles other than as described herein.
- Access to API Discovery in Acunetix requires either an Account or System Administrator
  role, or a custom role with the API Discovery permission.
- When linking an API to a target, the API base URL must be a subset of the target
  URL.
- Adding a new target will use one of your available licenses.
- Risk Scores are displayed on the Discovery page for each of your discovered web
  assets.
- You can only filter by one risk score at a time.
- Targets are added to Acunetix either from the Discovery page or the Targets page.
- You can import a number of Targets into Acunetix using a .csv file.
- Acunetix supports the OAuth2 authentication mechanism, enabling you to configure
  scans for websites that require it.
- Added support for JAVA IAST Sensor running on WebLogic
- Added an option to disable the DAST scanner from exposing secrets
- With the 24.12.0 release, Acunetix 360 upgraded from .NET 6 to .NET 8. This upgrade
  may affect customers using agents on certain Linux distributions due to changes
  in operating system dependencies.
- Microsoft has deprecated .NET 6, and upgrading to .NET 8 is mandatory for Acunetix
  360 to maintain compatibility and support.
- Verifying the Hash Value for Package Integrity in Acunetix 360 On-Premises
- 'IMPORTANT: When adding authentication credentials for the scanner to use, ensure
  you provide an appropriate level of permissions/access for the environment you are
  testing (production, staging, development, dedicated security operations environment,
  etc.) and consider whether the access provided can cause damage to your application.'
- We strongly recommend scanning APIs only in a non-production environment.
- Scanning production APIs should be conducted with care. Some scanning methods may
  result in data deletion.
- If you want to scan only the imported WSDL and not all the other paths belonging
  to the target, enable the checkbox next to Restrict scans to import files and click
  Save before starting the scan.
- Only the latest scan result for a specific target is displayed upon opening the
  scan.
- AcuSensor shows the exact location of the issue and simplifies remediation efforts.
- If you want to scan only the imported GraphQL schema and not all the other paths
  belonging to the target, enable the checkbox next to Restrict scans to import files.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '404 Not Found: Check the URL and try again'
- Fixed Sqlite exception in verifier
- 'Authorization issues: Implementing authorization can be confusing and tedious.'
- 'Denial of service: Via stacking queries, you force the server to repeatedly issue
  requests.'
- 'Secondary contexts path traversals: It can be dangerous to talk to microservices
  via your API.'
