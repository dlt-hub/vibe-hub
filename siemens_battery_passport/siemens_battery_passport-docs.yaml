auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.siemens.com/battery-passport/getting-started.html:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Pass the JWT token in the `Authorization`
    header as `Bearer {jwtHeader}.{jwtPayload}.{jwtSignature}`. The token is obtained
    from a prior authentication request and expires after the duration specified in
    the `expires_in` property (typically 24 hours). The scope `application.bp_portal.data_viewer`
    must be included when requesting the token.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is required. Obtain a JWT from SiemensID using
    CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET via POST to the provided tenant URL with grant_type
    "client_credentials" and audience "https://api.battery-passport.siemens.com".
    Include the returned access_token value in the Authorization header as a Bearer
    token for all API requests. The token expires after the seconds specified in expires_in
    (typically 86400).
  - The Battery Passport API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication.
    To authenticate, exchange your Client ID and Client Secret with the SiemensID
    identity provider to obtain a JWT token, then include the JWT in subsequent API
    requests to the Battery Passport APIs.
