notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- For multimodal support, use config/default_mm_with_images.yaml which includes image
  processing capabilities.
- In both files, there's a missing colon (`:`) at the end of the function definition
  on line 4.
- The error message in the PR description points to this exact issue.
- Great! The syntax error is fixed. Now we're getting a different error, which is
  expected because we're trying to divide by zero.
- Test with valid inputs
- Test with zero division (edge case)
- Test with non-numeric inputs (edge case)
- Ensure to test the implementation of the function thoroughly before submission.
- The implementation of the `firstMissingPositive` function has been successfully
  added to the `main.py` file.
- The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it.
- Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit.
- If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed.
- Indentation really matters when editing a file.
- Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what
  you wanted to accomplish.
- The main.py file is present in the current directory.
- Uses YAML configuration files to define agent behavior and tools.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'ZeroDivisionError: division by zero'
- 'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: ''str'' and ''int'''
