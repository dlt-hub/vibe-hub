- The UAT already has all required permissions by default.
- The STACKIT service account needs the editor role to create STACKIT LoadBalancers.
- Use edgelessdb-sgx-1gb primarily to test EdgelessDB on machines with limited resources.
- Prefer edgelessdb-sgx-4gb for production deployments.
- This guide requires an SGX machine.
