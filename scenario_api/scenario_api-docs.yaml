    your API key and secret confidential to prevent unauthorized access.'

  - Basic HTTP authentication using API key and secret. Credentials are base64-encoded
    as "apiKey:apiSecret" and sent in the Authorization header with the "Basic" scheme.
  - Basic authentication is required. Send credentials as a Base64-encoded string
    in the Authorization header using the format "Basic {credentials}", where credentials
    is the Base64-encoded username:password pair. The same Authorization header must
    be included in all requests, including polling requests to check job status.
