auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.apostrophecms.org/reference/api/authentication.html:
  - 'API key authentication is configured via an `apiKeys` object in the `@apostrophecms/express`
    module options, where each key maps to a user role. API keys can be sent either
    as an `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` HTTP header or as an `apikey` or `apiKey`
    query parameter. Bearer tokens are obtained by making a POST request to `/api/v1/@apostrophecms/login/login`
    with `username` and `password` in the request body, and are intended for browser
    and headless application use tied to a single user account.'
  - API key authentication is supported via either the Authorization header with format
    "ApiKey your-api-key-here" or via the apikey query parameter. The endpoint /api/v1/@apostrophecms/login/whoami
    is used to retrieve current user information after authentication.
  - Authentication uses username and password credentials sent in the POST request
    body to the login endpoint. The server returns a token in the response, which
    must then be included in all subsequent API requests via the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}". The Authorization header is required for POST, PUT, PATCH,
    and DELETE operations, and recommended for GET operations to access loginRequired
    documents.
  - 'Session-based authentication using HTTP cookies. The API returns a session cookie
    via the Set-Cookie header after login, which should be automatically included
    in subsequent requests. To end a session, send a POST request to /api/v1/@apostrophecms/login/logout
    with credentials: ''include'' to include the session cookie.'
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: bearer tokens and session cookies.
    For bearer tokens, send a POST request to `/api/v1/@apostrophecms/login/login`
    with username and password, then include the returned token in the `Authorization`
    header as `Bearer <token>`. For session cookies, include `session: true` in the
    login request body and use `credentials: ''include''` to automatically persist
    the cookie across requests. To log out, send a POST request to `/api/v1/login/logout`
    with the same authorization header.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.apostrophecms.org/reference/api/pieces.html:
  - Use query parameters page (for page number) and perPage (for results per page)
    to paginate results from GET /api/v1/:piece-name. The documentation does not specify
    response fields indicating pagination state or how to determine when to stop paginating.
