  : - 'Basic authentication is required in the Authorization header during token acquisition,
      formatted as "Authorization: Basic {credentials}". After obtaining an access
      token, use it in the Authorization header as "Authorization: {Access Token}"
      for all subsequent API requests. Role-based access control is enforced, requiring
      specific REST API permissions assigned to the OAuth Client''s role to authorize
      different types of API calls.'
    - OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow is used for API authentication. Create an
      OAuth client in the console to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. Generate
      an access token by making a POST request to the region-specific Token URL with
      grant_type=client_credentials in the body, the Content-Type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
      and an Authorization header containing Basic authentication with base64-encoded
      Client ID and Client Secret credentials.
    - Workspace ONE UEM supports OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization
      of REST API calls. The Workspace ONE Token Service is the token issuer for OAuth
      authentication, available only in SaaS environments, with region-specific token
      URLs. Developers must use the appropriate regional token endpoint to obtain
      OAuth 2.0 tokens for authenticating REST API requests.
    - You can authenticate API calls to Workspace ONE UEM using OAuth tokens, and
      you should select an OAuth token URL closest to your data center. The documentation
      indicates OAuth token-based authentication is supported, but specific details
      about token acquisition flow, required headers, parameter names, scopes, client
      credentials, or endpoint URLs are not provided in this excerpt.
