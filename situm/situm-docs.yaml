auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.situm.com/pages/rest/openapi/:
  - 'API Key authentication is required. Send the API key via the Authorization header
    using the Bearer scheme (format: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY) or as an
    API_KEY query parameter. Refer to the AuthorizationAPIKEY documentation section
    for complete details on credential submission and scopes.'
  - Authentication requires either a Bearer JWT token or an API key. Send the Bearer
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}", or send the API key via
    the AuthorizationAPIKEY method (exact header/parameter name not specified in this
    excerpt).
  - 'Authorization is via Bearer JWT token or API key. Send the Bearer JWT token in
    the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" or send the API key
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: {api_key}". Both methods are supported
    for authentication.'
  - 'Authorization requires either a Bearer JWT token or an API key. Send the Bearer
    JWT in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" or send the

  - 'Authorization requires either a Bearer JWT token or an API key. Send the Bearer
    JWT token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" or send

    also accepts API key authentication via the AuthorizationAPIKEY method.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.situm.com/pages/rest/openapi/:
  - Pagination uses a query parameter page (1-indexed) with response fields first,
    last, totalPages, totalElements, numberOfElements, size, number, and links containing
    first, last, self, and next URLs to navigate pages.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-limit parameters within the request body: size (page size,
    default 0) and number (page index, default 0). Response metadata includes total_pages,
    total_elements, number_of_elements, size, number, first, and last flags to indicate
    pagination state.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters size (integer, default 10) and page (integer,
    default 1). The response includes paginated geofence results filtered by organization_id,
    building_id, name, and deleted status.
  - The API uses query parameters `page` (integer) and `size` (integer) to control
    pagination. The response includes a `data` array containing the paginated results.
    The documentation does not specify response fields indicating how to navigate
    to the next page, such as `next`, `has_more`, `total_count`, or `page_count`.
  - The endpoint uses query parameters page (integer, required) and size (integer,
    required) to paginate results. The response returns a data array containing device
    objects. No explicit next/previous fields or has_more indicators are documented
    in the provided response structure.
