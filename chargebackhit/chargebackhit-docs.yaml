auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.chargebackhit.com/:
  - Public key and signature-based request authentication. The public_key header uniquely
    identifies the client (shared during registration), and the signature header contains
    a signature that verifies request genuineness. Both are required as header parameters
    with a maximum length of 255 characters each.
  - 'Request authentication uses a signature-based scheme with two required headers:
    public_key (unique identifier shared at registration) and signature (request signature
    for verification). Both are strings up to 255 characters and must be included
    in the request headers.'

    characters) for verifying request genuineness, and public_key (string, max 255
    characters) which is a unique identifier shared during registration alongside
    a Private Key. The signature appears to be computed from the request and sent
    as a header to authenticate the API call.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.chargebackhit.com/:
  - Pagination is handled via a pagination object in the request body and response.
    The request body includes a pagination object for controlling result limits, and
    the response includes a pagination object providing navigation details. Exact
    pagination parameters and response fields are not specified in the documentation.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters in the request body. The limit parameter
    specifies the maximum number of results (example value 100), and offset specifies
    the starting position (example value 0). The response includes a pagination object
    to help manage result limits and network traffic.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters in the request body. The limit parameter
    specifies the maximum number of results to return, and offset specifies the starting
    position. The response includes a pagination object but specific fields for navigation
    are not detailed in this documentation.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of results per page (default or max 100), offset specifies the starting position
    for results. The response includes total_count indicating total available results
    and current offset, allowing clients to calculate remaining pages and construct
    subsequent requests.
