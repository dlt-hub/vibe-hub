  - 'Bitrix24 REST API supports two authentication approaches: incoming webhooks for
    simple tasks, and OAuth 2.0 with temporary secure authorization tokens for complex
    scenarios involving multiple users or marketplace solutions. OAuth 2.0 is the
    recommended method for production implementations.'
- information_source; https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/settings/how-to-call-rest-api/authorization.html:
  - 'Authorization can be provided in two ways: either by including a permanent incoming
    local webhook code in the URL path (format: `/rest/{userId}/{webhookCode}/`),
    or by passing a temporary OAuth 2.0 access token in the request body as an `auth`
    field. The webhook code approach embeds credentials directly in the URL, while
    the OAuth token approach sends it as `"auth": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` in the JSON
    request body.'
  - Bitrix24 REST API uses a temporary authorization token passed as the `auth` parameter
    in the request body (JSON). The token is a string containing user ID and system
    values; local applications use OAuth 2.0 protocol for token acquisition. Pass
    the token in the JSON request body field named `auth` with the format shown in
    the example.
  - Webhook-based authorization uses a user ID and secret webhook code passed in the
    URL path (e.g., `your-domain.bitrix24.com/rest/1/8g9l071eismy9q2l/crm.deal.add`),
    where the user ID and secret code serve as the authorization credentials. For
    OAuth 2.0 applications, a temporary authorization token is used (details incomplete
    in provided text).
