  - B2B Digital requires OAuth 2.0 for most endpoints and network authentication via
    IP whitelisting. The checkout endpoint additionally requires RSA encryption. Access
    tokens have a validity period returned in the login response; it is recommended
    to generate a new access_token 10 minutes before expiration while the old token
    remains active until its stated expiry time.
  - OAuth and Digital Signature authentication methods are used. OAuth requires token-based
    authorization for API access. Digital Signature involves signing requests cryptographically
    to verify authenticity and integrity of API calls.
- information_source; https://developer.tokopedia.com/openapi/b2b/api-reference/web-service-security/:
  - Authorization header uses Bearer token with base64-encoded client credentials
    in format "client_id:client_secret". Signature header contains RSA-PSS signature
    over the request message, base64-encoded. Both headers are required for POST requests
    to /v2/order endpoint.
  - Bearer token authentication is required in the Authorization header. Obtain the
    access token by first acquiring client_id and client_secret from the Developer
    Console, then use those credentials to request an access token via the token generation
    flow. Include the Bearer token in every API request. Additionally, a digital signature
    (PSS or PKCS mode) in the Signature header and current RFC1123-formatted timestamp
    in the Date header are mandatory for checkout requests.
  - Client ID and Client Secret credentials are obtained from the Developer Console's
    Authentication Management section. To get an access token, base64-encode your
    client_id:client_secret pair and send it in a POST request to https://accounts.tokopedia.com/token?grant_type=client_credentials
    using the Authorization header with the base64-encoded string. Use credentials
    from the Testing App for sandbox (https://b2b-playground.tokopedia.com/api) or
    Live App for production (https://b2b.tokopedia.com/api), and ensure your production
    server IP is whitelisted.
