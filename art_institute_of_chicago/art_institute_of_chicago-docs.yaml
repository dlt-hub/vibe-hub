pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.artic.edu/:
  - Listing and search endpoints use query parameter pagination with page (1-based,
    default 1) to request specific pages and limit (default 12) to set records per
    page. The API returns 12 records per page by default.
  - Paginated endpoints use query parameters page and limit to control pagination.
    Responses include a pagination block with total, limit, offset, current_page,
    total_pages, prev_url, and next_url fields. Use the prev_url and next_url values
    to navigate to previous and next pages, or construct requests with page and limit
    parameters.
  - Pagination is supported via the `from` parameter, which specifies the starting
    point of results using Elasticsearch conventions. This indicates offset-based
    pagination where `from` controls the result offset in the response.
  - Pagination uses Elasticsearch conventions with `from` (starting point) and `size`
    (number of results to return) as query parameters. The response includes a `pagination`
    object containing `total` (total results) and `limit` (results per request).
  - Pagination uses Elasticsearch conventions with `from` (starting point, default
    0) and `size` (number of results, default 10) as query parameters. Response includes
    a `pagination` object containing `total` (total results), `limit` (results per
    page), `offset` (current offset), `total_pages` (number of pages), and `current_page`
    (current page number).
