  - 'Calls to the ttid service require two headers: x-api-key header with your application
    key value, and Authorization header with Bearer token format. Obtain your application
    key and token by following the Before you begin and Authentication and request
    IDs articles in the TT REST API documentation.'
- information_source; https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/tt-rest/v2_uat/gs-token.html:
  - 'All requests to the TT REST API require an Application Key passed as the x-api-key
    header. Most requests additionally require a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header (format: Authorization=Bearer <token>) and a request ID passed as a query
    string parameter (requestId=<app_name>-<company_name>--<new_guid>). Application
    Keys are created in the Setup application, are associated with a specific login,
    inherit that login''s permissions, and are environment-specific (separate keys
    needed for UAT and Live).'
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. To authorize requests, obtain a token
    by sending your TT REST API Application Key and Application Secret in a POST request
    to the /token endpoint. Then enter the Application Key and "Bearer " followed
    by the token (with a space) in the Authorize dialog to authenticate all subsequent
    calls. Each request from your application must include a unique GUID for the requestId
    parameter.

    as Bearer <token>.'

    "Bearer " with your token value). Obtain both the application key and token from
