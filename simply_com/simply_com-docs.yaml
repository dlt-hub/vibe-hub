    Account-number (format Sxxxxxx) and the password is the API-Key for that account.
    Both credentials are found in the Simply.com Control Panel and should be sent
    in the standard HTTP Authorization header with Basic scheme.
  - Basic authentication is required. Send credentials as HTTP Basic Auth using the
    format username:password, where username is your ACCOUNTNAME and password is your
    APIKEY. The credentials are passed in the Authorization header using the standard
    Basic Auth scheme (base64-encoded "ACCOUNTNAME:APIKEY").
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Use the ACCOUNTNAME as the username and
    APIKEY as the password in the Authorization header, or pass them as query parameters
    username and password to the Simply.com DDNS API endpoint at https://api.simply.com/2/ddns/.
