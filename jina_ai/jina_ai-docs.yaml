    endpoint: "/reader"
    method: "GET"

    endpoint: "/search"
    method: "POST"
    params:

### Explanation of the YAML Structure:
1. **Client Configuration**: Specifies the base URL and the authentication method (Bearer token).
2. **Resources**: Lists two main API endpoints (`reader` and `search`), including their HTTP methods, parameters, and data selectors.
3. **Notes**: Provides crucial information about authentication, rate limits, and other operational details.
4. **Errors**: Lists common HTTP error codes that can be encountered.
5. **Auth Info**: Mentions details about the required authentication method.
6. **Source Metadata**: Offers a brief description of what the API provides.

This YAML configuration is structured to be easily understood and directly usable for setting up the API source in a data pipeline.
