  - 'Authentication is performed via the "Authorization" header with a Bearer token.
    Include the header "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" in all requests to the
    TSD REST API endpoints. A 401 status code indicates unauthorized access.'
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Send the access token in the "Authorization"
    header with format "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN". A 401 status code indicates unauthorized
    access.
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header with format "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN". The base URL is https://tsd.proficloud.io/query
    and the request method is GET. Include the query parameter q with InfluxDB-style
    query syntax. A 401 status code indicates unauthorized access.
  - OAuth2 authentication is mandatory for the TSD REST API. Initial token retrieval
    requires a POST request to https://tsd.proficloud.io/epts/token with a JSON payload
    containing username and password fields, returning an access_token and refresh_token
    with expiration times. The access_token must be included in subsequent API requests
    and should be reused until expiration; the refresh_token can be used to obtain
    new tokens without resupplying credentials. The Content-Type header must be set
    to application/json.
  - To access the Time Series Data Service REST API, authentication via OAuth is mandatory.
    A token can be requested either via username and password for initial authentication
    or via a refresh token provided by the service. You will need a user account and
    the UUID of at least one device sending data to obtain TSD data from proficloud.io.
