notes:
- Canvases are designed to load fast, so avoid embedding a lot of external resources.
- Avoid compiling UI kit with your app (using webpack or any other package manager).
  They are cached at the browser side, and this cache is shared between all canvases
  when loaded from our servers.
- Canvas resources are usually cached on the client, and the only way to clean the
  cache is by setting a short expiration time HTTP header on your server or changing
  the name of the file.
- Keep it simple; don’t create external .JS files if you are not planning to reuse
  those files.
- Feel free to use arrow functions or anything else from ES2015 (ES6). We do not support
  IE 11.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Personal tokens can change at any moment, so you should never store them in your
  app.
- Tokens are authentication keys and are always associated with an app.
- All tokens will expire from time to time. You should subscribe to the webhook 'organization_token_updated'
  and update the token when you receive that webhook.
- Our API throttling is based on tokens. A single token can make no more than 60 requests
  per minute.
- The GraphQL API supports batch queries, but be aware that the request may be rejected
  based on the complexity (any request that could affect the performance of the server
  could be rejected).
- Every request will be replied to with request counters (remaining count, time for
  count reset) via HTTP response headers.
- Will be returned only if the token is valid and not expired
- Will be returned only if the user is an admin or if its an organization token
- Will be returned only if the token has permissions to handle bookings
- Will be returned only if the token has permissions to handle check-ins
- Will be returned only if the token has permissions to handle invoices
- 'Making a new booking or modifying the existing one is a two-step process: first
  draft, then commit.'
- The API requires the booking session ID in all subsequent requests related to that
  booking set.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- We strongly recommend supplementing the use of webhooks with a query to the public
  API to retrieve the complete and most up-to-date dataset.
- Learn more about subscribing to webhooks
- This tool only shows webhooks triggered at the Optix Organization where the app
  was created.
- Always use HTTPS in your services. The usage of HTTP is insecure and can lead to
  identity spoofing.
- The maximum height is 400 (the unit is ‘dp,’ you can consider them to be pixels
  relative to a 1x resolution screen).
- You must specify at least one (and a maximum of six) MOBILE_HOME_SECTION_ITEM for
  a MOBILE_HOME_SECTION.
- Optix may alter, suspend, or discontinue the Developer Platform at any time and
  for any reason or no reason, without prior notice.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '400 Bad Request: Check your input parameters or query syntax.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Ensure you have valid authentication tokens.'
- 410 response will force the webhook subscription to be removed
- Any request that takes more time will be considered failed
