    Construct the Authorization header by base64-encoding the string "user:{apikey}"
    and send it as "Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_value>".'
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are constructed by base64-encoding
    the string "user:{apikey}" and passed in the Authorization header with the "Basic"
    scheme. The apikey value must be obtained separately and used as the password
    component in the Basic auth credentials.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent via the Authorization
    header as "Basic" followed by a Base64-encoded string of "user:<api_key>". The
