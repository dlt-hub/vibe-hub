In this guide, we'll set up a complete Klaviyo data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def klaviyo_marketing_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
,
        },
        "resources": [
            "campaigns",
            "templates",
            "events"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='klaviyo_marketing_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='klaviyo_marketing_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(klaviyo_marketing_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from klaviyo_marketing‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Campaigns: Retrieve information about marketing campaigns.
- Email Templates: Access and manage email templates used for campaigns.
- Events: Fetch and manage event-driven data related to user interactions.
- Flows: Handle sequences of automated actions based on customer behavior.
- Global Exclusions: Manage lists of email addresses excluded from all communications.
- Lists: Operate on contact lists, including detailed list information.
- Metrics: Gather metrics related to various marketing efforts.
- Profiles: Manage user profiles, which may experience transient errors under heavy API load.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Klaviyo workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@klaviyo_marketing-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Klaviyo support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:klaviyo_marketing duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Klaviyo API, as specified in @klaviyo_marketing-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "campaigns" and "templates" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in klaviyo_marketing_pipeline.py and name the pipeline klaviyo_marketing_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python klaviyo_marketing_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed through an API key included in the header of the requests.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.klaviyo.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python klaviyo_marketing_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline klaviyo_marketing load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset klaviyo_marketing_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/klaviyo_marketing.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline klaviyo_marketing_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("klaviyo_marketing_pipeline").dataset()
   # get campaigns table as Pandas frame
   data.campaigns.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Users should monitor API usage to avoid exceeding request limits, handle potential transient errors in the Profiles endpoint, and implement retries for 500 Internal Server Errors. Authorization must be correctly set to avoid Unauthorized errors.
