auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.paessler.com/support/prtg/api/v2/overview/index.html:
  - 'Most endpoints require authentication via one of three methods: credentials (username/password
    sent to POST /session), API key (created in Account Settings | My Account), or
    single sign-on if configured. After authentication, protected endpoints (marked
    with lock symbols) become accessible.'
  - PRTG API v2 uses bearer token authentication. Obtain a token by sending a POST
    request to the /session endpoint with a JSON body containing username and password
    fields. The returned token must be included in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    <token>" for all subsequent API requests. Single sign-on (SSO) is available in
    the Swagger UI but is not suitable for scripting or automation.
  - The PRTG API v2 uses bearer token authentication. Obtain a bearer token by sending
    a POST request to the `/session` endpoint with a JSON body containing username
    and password fields. Include the token in the Authorization header with the format
    "Bearer <token>" for subsequent API requests. API keys can also be created through
    the PRTG UI or the API key endpoint and used as bearer tokens with the same Authorization
    header format.
- information_source; https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/add_an_auto-discovery_group:
  - 'PRTG REST API supports four authentication methods: None (default), Basic authentication
    (username and password), Bearer authentication (OAuth2 bearer token), or Session-based
    authentication (login path with optional basic auth header). For Basic auth, send
    credentials via username and password fields. For Bearer auth, include the bearer
    token in the Authorization header. For Session-based auth, configure a login endpoint
    (GET or POST to a specified path), optionally with basic authentication header
    using placeholders %restusername and %restpassword, and the resulting session
    token is used for subsequent requests.'
  - The API supports OAuth2 bearer token authorization, transmitted either via HTTP
    header or cookie. For header-based auth, specify a custom header name (case-sensitive,
    e.g., X-Authenticate); for cookie-based auth, specify a custom cookie name (case-sensitive).
    Placeholders %restplaceholder1 through %restplaceholder4 can be used to inject
    credential values into request URLs, POST bodies, and custom headers.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.paessler.com/support/prtg/api/v2/overview/index.html:
  - Pagination uses `limit` (max objects per request, default/omit returns up to 3,000)
    and `offset` (zero-based starting position) query parameters. Response headers
    include `Link` (RFC5988 format with rel="previous" and rel="next" URLs), `X-Result-Count`
    (items in current response), and `X-Total-Count` (total available items). Construct
    next request using the next URL from Link header or increment offset by limit
    value.
  - Pagination uses the `limit` query parameter to control page size, with response
    headers `X-Result-Count` indicating returned items and `X-Total-Count` indicating
    total available items. The `Link` HTTP header with rel values enables automatic
    pagination following in clients like PowerShell's `-FollowRelLink` option.
