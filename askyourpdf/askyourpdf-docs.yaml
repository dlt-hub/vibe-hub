pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.askyourpdf.com/api:
  - The API uses query parameters page (default 1) and page_size (default 10) to paginate
    results. The response structure for paginated endpoints is not explicitly detailed
    in the provided documentation, so specific fields indicating pagination state
    (such as total_count, has_more, or next_page) cannot be confirmed from this excerpt.
  - The GET /api/knowledge endpoint supports pagination via optional query parameters
    page (integer) and page_size (integer). The response includes total_pages (integer)
    indicating the total number of pages available, and a knowledge_bases array containing
    the paginated results. To paginate, increment the page parameter in subsequent
    requests until reaching total_pages.
  - The endpoint uses query parameters `page` (integer, optional, defaults to 1) and
    `page_size` (integer, optional, defaults to 10) to control pagination. The response
    includes `total_pages` indicating the total number of pages available, and documents
    are returned in the `documents` array.
  - Use query parameter `page` (optional, integer) to retrieve paginated document
    lists. Response includes pagination metadata to determine if more pages exist
    and how to construct subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://docs.askyourpdf.com/askyourpdf-docs:
  - Pagination is used for the documents list endpoint with query parameters page
    (starting at 1) and page_size (default 10) to control which results are returned,
    though the response structure and how to determine when pagination ends is not
    documented in the provided excerpt.
