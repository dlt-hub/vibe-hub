pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.carrierx.com/voice/quick-starts/sip-trunk:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes a pagination
    object with a next field containing the full URL for the next page, an offset
    field indicating the current position, a limit field showing items per page, and
    a total field for total count. To paginate, use the next URL or increment the
    offset parameter by the limit value.
  - The available DIDs endpoint uses a limit query parameter to control pagination.
    The response includes a count field indicating the number of returned items, a
    has_more boolean field to indicate if additional results exist, and an items array
    containing the paginated results. Continue requesting with the same limit parameter
    while has_more is true to retrieve all available DIDs.
- information_source; https://docs.carrierx.com/voice/core-api/using-the-rest-api:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    page size (default 2 in example), offset specifies the starting position. Response
    includes total count, next and previous URLs for navigation, and stops when no
    next URL is provided. Alternatively, after and before query parameters accept
    secure IDs to return results following or preceding that ID, useful when total
    count is unavailable.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    the number of results per page (default and maximum values not specified in provided
    text), and offset specifies the starting position. Response includes total count
    and data array; construct next request by incrementing offset by limit value until
    offset exceeds total count.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter controls
    page size (default 1 in this example), offset specifies the starting position,
    and the response includes a pagination object with a previous field containing
    the URL for the previous page.
