pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/:
  - Pagination for listing conversations uses a page query parameter (page=2 in the
    example). No explicit response fields for pagination navigation are shown in the
    provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses a query parameter page (e.g., page=2) to request specific pages.
    The documentation shows an example with page=2 but does not specify response fields
    indicating pagination state, total pages, or when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 1) and per_page (default 30,
    max 100). The response link header contains the next page URL with rel="next"
    if more pages exist; absence of the link header indicates the last page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page_size and tokens. Request page_size as an
    optional query parameter to set records per page. Use next_token from response
    links to fetch the next page by including it in the next request's query parameters.
    Use prev_token similarly for previous pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters per_page (optional, controls number of results
    per page) and page (optional, specifies page number starting from 1). The API
    returns paginated results where you increment the page parameter value to retrieve
    subsequent pages.
