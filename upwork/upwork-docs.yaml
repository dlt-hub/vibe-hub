auth_info:
- information_source; http://www.upwork.com/developer/explorer/:
  - The GraphQL API requires the X-Upwork-API-TenantId header to specify an Organization
    context. The Authorization header is automatically provided by the system and
    will be removed from the Request Headers section. If no Organization is selected,
    the context defaults to the currently logged-in user.
- information_source; https://www.upwork.com/developer/documentation/graphql/api/docs/index.html:
  - Client Credentials OAuth2 grant type is used to obtain access tokens. Send a POST
    request to https://www.upwork.com/api/v3/oauth2/token with parameters grant_type
    set to "client_credentials", client_id, and client_secret. The response includes
    an access_token field with token_type "Bearer" and expires_in value of 86400 seconds.
    Use the returned access_token as a Bearer token in subsequent API requests. Refresh
    Token Grant Type can be used to exchange an expired access token for a new one
    without user interaction.
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Include Authorization header with bearer
    token format (Authorization: bearer oauth2v2_...). Each request also requires
    X-Upwork-API-TenantId header to specify organization context; obtain the organizationId
    value via company selector GraphQL query. Client credentials (client_id and client_secret)
    are provided for each client identifier.'
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. After user authorization, exchange the
    authorization code for an access token by POST to https://www.upwork.com/api/v3/oauth2/token
    with required parameters: grant_type set to "authorization_code", client_id, client_secret,
    code (authorization code from redirect), and redirect_uri. The endpoint returns
    an access token with TTL.'
  - 'To refresh an access token using the Refresh Token Grant Type, send a POST request
    to https://www.upwork.com/api/v3/oauth2/token with the following required parameters
    in the request body: grant_type set to "refresh_token", client_id with your application''s
    Client ID, client_secret with your application''s Client Secret, and refresh_token
    with a valid refresh token. The response returns a new access_token and refresh_token
    along with the access token''s TTL.'
