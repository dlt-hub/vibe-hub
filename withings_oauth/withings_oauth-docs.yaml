auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.withings.com/api-reference:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with two authentication methods for token exchange.
    Use either client secret or HMAC signature to request access_token and refresh_token
    from an authorization_code, or to refresh an existing access_token. Required parameters
    include grant_type, client_id, and either client_secret or a signature. The response
    includes userid which must be stored in your database.
  - Use a valid access_token in the Authorization header for Health Data APIs, or
    use signature, nonce, and client_id query parameters for Logistics APIs and Cellular
    Solutions integrations. The signature and nonce parameters must not be used together
    with access_token.
