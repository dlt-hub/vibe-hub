pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.boomi.com/docs/APIs/PlatformAPI/Introduction/Query_paging:
  - Query paging uses a token-based approach where QUERY requests return maximum 100
    results. When more results exist, the response includes a queryToken field that
    must be passed in a subsequent queryMore request to retrieve additional results.
    Continue paginating until no queryToken is returned in the response.
  - Use the queryToken returned in the initial query response to request subsequent
    pages via POST to /queryMore endpoint, passing only the token value in the request
    body. Continue paginating by using the queryToken from each response until no
    further token is returned.
- information_source; https://developer.boomi.com/docs/APIs/PlatformSOAPAPI/Introduction/API-connectors:
  - Handle query paging automatically using the queryMore token.
