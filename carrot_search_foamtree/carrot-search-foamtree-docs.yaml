notes:
- FoamTree requires a HTML5-compliant browser to run.
- The element HTML needs to have non-zero dimensions at the time FoamTree initializes.
- Uses lazy loading for lower levels of hierarchy.
- Loading of data for the visualization but also computation of the diagram can take
  a while for larger data sets.
- You can use the carrotsearch.foamtree.util.hints.js utility to show contextual suggestions
  on how to browse the data.
- Most modern browsers meet the requirements and can run FoamTree.
- Since 3.2.0 Use rectangular layout by setting layout to ordered or squarified.
- Increase relaxationQualityThreshold. Try values from 0.5 through 1.0 up to 10.
- Set relaxationInitializer to ordered or squarified.
- Show relaxation to the user by setting relaxationVisible to true.
- Cap total relaxation time using relaxationMaxDuration.
- For the changes of visual options to take effect, you will need to explicitly call
  the redraw method.
- applicable only when `stacking` is set to `flattened` and `descriptionGroupType`
  is `floating`
- applicable only when `layout` is set to `ordered` or `squarified`
- applicable only when `layout` is set to `relaxed`
- 'Determines the initial layout of groups'' polygons. The following values are supported:
  fisheye, blackhole, ordered, squarified, random.'
- Setting `groupBorderWidth` to a value smaller than `groupStrokeWidth` / 2 + 0.5
  will prevent FoamTree from using incremental drawing routines and therefore slow
  down visualization updates during hover, opening and selection changes.
- On slower devices and/or larger data sets, FoamTree may automatically disable rendering
  of gradients to improve the rendering performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- When visualizing hierarchical models, setting a positive rolloutScalingStrength
  may create unpleasant effects because child groups will be drawn on top of their
  parents during the animation.
- Note that when wireframeLabelDrawing is set to never, group labels will not be drawn
  at all during rollout. When wireframeLabelDrawing is set to auto, labels may or
  may not be drawn during the rollout, depending on the performance of the device
  and the size of the data set.
- The limited demo version of FoamTree does not allow to disable or change the attribution
  group.
- Some properties may return undefined based on the interaction state.
- Disappearing exposed groups fixed in version 3.5.2.
- JavaScript errors on high zoom levels fixed in version 3.5.2.
- Support for touch-based interaction requires some extra embedding steps.
- Since 3.2.0 Use rectangular layout by setting `layout` to `ordered` or `squarified`.
- Increase `relaxationQualityThreshold`. If you'd like to keep the polygonal layout
  with large data sets, lowering layout quality may help performance.
- Set `relaxationInitializer` to `ordered` or `squarified`.
- Show relaxation to the user by setting `relaxationVisible` to `true`.
- applicable only when `stacking` is set to `flattened` and `descriptionGroupType`
  is `floating`.
- If `true`, groups whose weight is zero will be visible, with their weight slightly
  smaller than the smallest non-zero weight of the sibling groups.
- The hard limit on the number of groups FoamTree will attempt to include in a single
  visualization.
- applicable only when `layout` is set to `ordered` or `squarified`.
- Since 3.4.0
- Setting groupBorderWidth to a value smaller than groupStrokeWidth / 2 + 0.5 will
  prevent FoamTree from using incremental drawing routines and therefore slow down
  visualization updates during hover, opening and selection changes.
- The limited demo version of FoamTree does not allow to disable or change the attribution
  group. Please contact Carrot Search for licensing of a fully customizable distribution.
- FoamTree exposes a number of geometry utilities that may be useful when implementing
  the shape decorator code.
- FoamTree does not restrict the drawing area to the area of the polygon being filled.
- The polygon must be convex, vertex coordinates must be enumerated in clockwise or
  anti-clockwise order.
- Disappearing exposed groups fixed in version 3.5.2
- JavaScript errors on high zoom levels fixed in version 3.5.2
- FoamTree is available as an NPM dependency for use in modern application build systems.
- The core implementation and API of the visualization is contained in the carrotsearch.foamtree.js
  file.
- 'FoamTree is officially supported on the following browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla
  Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mac OS Safari, iOS Safari.'
- Uses rectangular layout by setting `layout` to `ordered` or `squarified`.
- For the changes of visual options to take effect, you will need to explicitly call
  the `redraw` method.
- when selection is changed using this method, the event listeners will not be called.
- when exposure is changed using this method, the event listeners will not be called.
- when open state is changed using this method, the event listeners will not be called.
- Setting groupStrokeWidth to a value larger than (groupBorderWidth - 0.5) * 2 will
  prevent FoamTree from using incremental drawing routines and therefore slow down
  visualization updates during hover, opening and selection changes.
- Setting groupSelectionOutlineWidth to a value larger than (groupBorderWidth-groupSelectionOutlineShadowSize-
  0.5) * 2 will prevent FoamTree from using incremental drawing routines and therefore
  slow down visualization updates during hover, opening and selection changes when
  one ore more groups are selected.
- Setting groupSelectionOutlineShadowSize to a value larger than (groupBorderWidth-groupSelectionOutlineWidth-
  0.5) * 2 will prevent FoamTree from using incremental drawing routines and therefore
  slow down visualization updates during hover, opening and selection changes when
  one ore more groups are selected.
- Setting groupLabelMinFontSize to a large value may result in many labels being replaced
  with an ellipsis ("dots").
- Setting groupLabelUpdateThreshold to 0 will cause FoamTree to re-layout the label
  on every group polygon change. Depending on the size of the data set, it may significantly
  slow down visualization rendering when relaxationVisible is true.
- The label color to use on dark groups.
- The magnification scale at which exposed groups will be drawn.
- The color of drop shadow to apply to exposed groups.
- The size of drop shadow to apply to exposed groups, in pixels.
- The margin size to apply when zooming to the exposed group.
- The amount of lightness to add or subtract from the groups base color's lightness
  when the group is unexposed.
- The amount of saturation to add or subtract from the groups base color's saturation
  when the group is unexposed.
- The `labelColorThreshold` value to use for unexposed groups.
- The duration of the group exposure and unexposure animation.
- The easing function to use during group exposure and unexposure animations.
- The duration of the group opening or closing animation.
- The opacity to use when filling groups that have child groups.
- The opacity to use when drawing strokes of groups that have child groups.
- The opacity to use when drawing labels of groups that have child groups.
- When set to `true`, FoamTree will try to equalize the opacity of groups' polygons.
- Start color to use if rainbow color model is used for coloring groups.
- End color to use if rainbow color model is used for coloring groups.
- Determines how the rainbow colors will be distributed.
- When `rainbowColorDistribution` is `radial`, determines the angle at which the rainbow
  color will start.
- Determines the angle of the linear gradient formed by the color lightness variations.
- When `rainbowColorDistribution` is `radial`, FoamTree can desaturate colors of the
  polygons lying close to the center of the visualization area.
- When `rainbowColorDistribution` is `radial`, FoamTree can adjust the lightness of
  colors of the polygons lying close to the center of the visualization area.
- Determines the strength of the color lightness variations applied to lower-level
  groups.
- Determines the central lightness value around which the lightness variations will
  be applied for the lower-level groups.
- A callback function you can use to customize or completely replace the default rainbow
  color model for groups.
- The point in the visualization container at which the rollout will start.
- FoamTree will start the rollout animation from the group determined using the `rolloutStartPoint`
  option.
- The duration of the rollout animation at one level of the hierarchy, in milliseconds.
- The animation easing function to use during rollout animation.
- The limited demo version of FoamTree will not call this decorator for the attribution
  group.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Disappearing exposed groups
- JavaScript errors on high zoom levels
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Opening a group by double click would change the selection state of the group being
  open. Release 2.0.1 fixes this issue.
- Adding a CSS border to the FoamTree container element might create a blurry visualization
  image. Release 2.0.1 fixes this issue.
- FoamTree optimized rendering routines would produce incorrect results on certain
  mobile devices. Version 2.0.1 defaults to slower but correct rendering routines.
