auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/:
  - 'GOV.UK Pay uses OAuth2 HTTP bearer token authentication. Include your API key
    in the Authorization header with Bearer prefix: Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}.
    The API key must be provided with every request.'
  - The API requires an API key for authentication. A 401 Unauthorised response indicates
    a missing or invalid API key. The documentation does not explicitly specify the
    header name, parameter name, or transmission method for the API key.
- information_source; https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/search_payments_reference/:
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token scheme. Send credentials as "Authorization:
    Bearer {api_token}" where the token is provided by the service (e.g., api_test_123abc456def).'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the API key as a Bearer token in
    the Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Bearer api_test_123abc456def".'
- information_source; https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/send_card_details_moto_reference/:
  - The `one_time_token` is a single-use token obtained when creating a MOTO payment
    and must be sent in the request body along with card details to the `/v1/auth`
    endpoint. The token is used to authorize the payment and is sent as the `one_time_token`
    field in a JSON POST request with Content-Type application/json.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/:
  - Responses from search endpoints are paginated with a default of 500 results per
    page. Use query parameters page (specific page number) and display_size (results
    per page) to control pagination. The response includes a _links object with self,
    first_page, last_page, prev_page, and next_page fields containing href and method
    to navigate between pages.
  - 'The documentation mentions pagination navigation options: `first_page`, `last_page`,
    `prev_page`, and `next_page` are available as links in responses to navigate between
    pages of results, though the specific request mechanism and response structure
    details are not fully described in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/search_payments_reference/:
  - The API uses query parameters page (specific page number) and display_size (number
    of payments per page) for pagination. The response structure for indicating total
    pages or next page information is not described in the provided documentation.
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: total (total number of results), count
    (results per page), and page (current page number). To paginate, use a page query
    parameter in subsequent requests to the /payments endpoint.'
