auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mindbowser.com/aidbox-fhir-server/:
  - SMART on FHIR implements OAuth 2.0 with healthcare-specific extensions. The authorization
    flow uses a Discovery Endpoint at /.well-known/smart-configuration, an Authorization
    Endpoint for scope requests, a Token Endpoint that issues JWT tokens with SMART
    claims, and a Userinfo Endpoint for practitioner context. Access control is enforced
    via a Policy Decision Point (PDP) architecture supporting attribute-based access
    control at resource, instance, attribute, and operation levels.
  - This documentation describes a SMART app OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. The
    client obtains an authorization code via a GET request to /auth/authorize with
    client_id, redirect_uri, scope, state, and aud parameters. The code is then exchanged
    for an access token via POST to /auth/token with grant_type=authorization_code,
    code, redirect_uri, and client_id. API requests are authenticated by including
    the access token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
- information_source; https://www.mindbowser.com/fitbit-subscription-create-and-remove-using-java-code/:
  - Authorization requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    " + FitbitAccessToken, and a custom header X-Fitbit-Subscriber-Id containing the
    fitBitSubscriberId value. Both are required for subscription management operations.
  - Fitbit API uses Bearer token authentication. The access token must be passed in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer " followed by the FitbitAccessToken value.
    Additionally, a custom header "X-Fitbit-Subscriber-Id" containing the fitBitSubscriberId
    is required. Both values are obtained from the user account and must be included
    in HTTP requests to Fitbit API endpoints.
- information_source; https://www.mindbowser.com/node-js-role-based-api-authorization/:
  - JWT authentication using HS256 algorithm with secret stored in process.env.secret
    environment variable. Authorization is role-based, checking if the user's role
    from req.user.role matches allowed roles; if not, a 401 Unauthorized response
    is returned.
