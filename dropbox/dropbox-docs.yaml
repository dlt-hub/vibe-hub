auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started:
  - Access tokens are required to call endpoints. Tokens can be obtained via the "get
    access token" link in the API documentation by selecting an App. Tokens should
    be stored securely, never shared, and can be revoked using the /token/revoke endpoint.
    The documentation indicates tokens are used to authenticate requests, though the
    specific header name or parameter format for sending the token is not detailed
    in this excerpt.
  - The API Explorer uses OAuth2 authentication. To authorize requests, you must click
    the 'Get Token' button in the API Explorer to obtain an access token for your
    Dropbox account, which is then used to authenticate subsequent API calls to endpoints.
- information_source; https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams:
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header with format "Bearer <access_token>". The required scope for this endpoint
    is groups.read.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Required scope
    is members.write. The token is obtained by signing in to pick apps and is sent
    as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" in the HTTP request header.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>". The access token must be obtained by signing
    in to pick apps through Dropbox's authentication flow.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used. The optional cursor parameter is passed in the
    request body; on the first call, omit cursor or pass null. Use the cursor value
    from the response to request the next page.
  - Cursor-based pagination. Request parameter cursor (String, required, in request
    body) indicates the starting point for the next set of users. Response includes
    cursor field for subsequent requests; use its value in the next request's cursor
    parameter to continue listing.
  - 'Cursor-based pagination. Request parameter: cursor (String, required, obtained
    from previous call). Response fields: cursor (for next request), has_more (Boolean,
    indicates if more results exist). Stop paginating when has_more is false.'
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. Call get_events to retrieve an initial
    cursor, then use get_events/continue endpoint with the cursor parameter in the
    request body to paginate through subsequent events. The response includes a cursor
    field for fetching the next page.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. Request parameter limit (UInt32, min=1,
    max=1000, default=1000) specifies results per call. Response includes cursor field
    for fetching next page and groups array containing results; use the returned cursor
    in subsequent requests to continue pagination.
