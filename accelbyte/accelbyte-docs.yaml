- 次の手順に従って、スタックフレームの欠落問題を解決できます。
- Doing this creates a new API Key.
- You can no longer access the game using the previous API Key.
- Files added to a game build are called 'metadata' files.
- The Search field works with the Date filter on the header, enabling searches for
  keywords over a period of time.
- Be aware that wildcard queries use an enormous amount of memory and perform badly.
- Keywords are case sensitive; you need to input the field name exactly.
- Only Admin users have access to the multiple API Key feature.
- Ensure the path for Unreal Engine is configured correctly for build registration.
- Under certain error conditions, the Smart Builds CLI may fail to terminate properly.
  This may cause users to encounter an "In queue" blocker when downloading another
  smart build.
- Microsoft Windows has a well-known file path length limitation of 260 characters
  (MAX_PATH). In some cases, specific operations may start failing when file paths
  exceed approximately 173 characters.
- Hardware information from Xbox One and Xbox Series X is not sent to ADT. This is
  likely due to platform restrictions that prevent Xbox devices from sharing system-level
  hardware data with third-party applications.
- ADT Web and Jira server integration is currently disabled. When attempting to establish
  a connection, a “This Jira page can’t be found” error is displayed, preventing a
  successful integration.
- Under certain error conditions, the Smart Builds CLI may fail to terminate properly.

- With the AccelByte Development Toolkit (ADT) Local Cache Server, studios can add
  a download cache to ADT Hub, which greatly reduces their download needs during development
  build distribution.
- The local cache server starts automatically after the installation process is successful.
- 'Minimum requirements for ADT Hub Local Cache Server setup: Memory: 4 GB, CPU: 2
  cores, Fast SSD for cache storage (NVMe M.2), Fast ethernet network.'
- Local Cache is an add-on you can request from AccelByte.

  it at the scheduled time.
- The steps in this article are applicable to creating DevKits for PS4, PS5, and Xbox
  consoles.
- You must already be subscribed to the channel with the build you want to download
  and deploy.
- You must have already created and connected the designated DevKit for the build.
- You can also run games without launch arguments.
- Smart Build is a new feature that will replace the legacy build distribution system,
  which will improve the speed of uploading and downloading a game binary.
- Smart Build uses a special technique that will improve upload and download bandwidth
  and time.
- Default setting is No limit on bandwidth
- Only an admin or dev can upload and download test results.
- You can upload one file per build with a maximum size of 20 MB.
- These instructions are for Nintendo Switch and are similar to those for other consoles
  like PS4, PS5, and Xbox.
- This feature is in alpha, so stability and coverage may be limited compared to Unreal
  Engine.
- Keep the Deleted Build in Local Storage option allows greater flexibility and control
  over how deleted builds are handled on user devices.
- Admins can now monitor which users are actively using ADT.
- Users with extended inactivity will be flagged in the Account Management menu.
- For the updated list of known issues in ADT components, along with their status
  and workarounds, refer to the ADT known issues list.
- Your first download following this update will require a short one-time migration
  for optimization purposes.
- ADT can send the minidump and parse the call stack in CallstackContext.runtime-xml
  using an Unreal Engine mechanism.
- To enable crash handling in Unreal Editor, you must get the Unreal Editor PDB file
  locally.
- Game Version ID is a unique ID the system generates for each game in a namespace.
- Game Version ID is a unique ID the system generates for each game in a namespace.
  It isn't related to versions shown under the Versions page.
- Automated tests include Sniff and Smoke tests.
- Performance tests include Frame time, GPU time, and Draw time.
- 'Automated tests produce two kinds of output: Unreal Log and ADT Log files.'
- Automated tests always generate the files in the same place; it's easy to use directory
  upload.
- Performance tests always generate the files in the same place, so it's easy to use
  the directory upload.
- Metadata files must follow the specified schema for performance or sniff tests.
- Wildcard queries use an enormous amount of memory and perform badly.
