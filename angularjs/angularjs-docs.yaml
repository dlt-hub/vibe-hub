notes:
- AngularJS support has officially ended as of January 2022.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Directives and scopes interact but do not create new instances of scope
- Isolate scope is useful for component directives
- Avoid dynamically changing the content of an interpolated string to prevent it from
  being overwritten.
- It is considered bad practice to embed interpolation markup inside an expression.
- Avoid dynamically changing the content of an interpolated string.
- Mixing interpolation and expressions increases complexity and impacts performance.
- Best practice to create isolate scopes when making components that you want to reuse.
- Isolated scopes prevent directives from affecting outer scope models except for
  explicitly passed models.
- Each Component has its own Router.
- $routerCanDeactivate hook is called to determine if navigation can occur.
- Uses HTML5 mode for clean URLs
- Keep the filtering function as lean as possible, because it will be called for each
  DOM action (e.g. insertion, removal, class change) performed by "animation-aware"
  directives.
- 'By setting transition: 0s, ngAnimate will ignore the existing transition styles,
  and not try to animate them (Javascript animations will still execute, though).'
- Double compilation occurs when an already compiled part of the DOM gets compiled
  again.
- The underscore rule applies only if the name starts and ends with exactly one underscore.
- Protractor does not work out-of-the-box with apps that bootstrap manually using
  angular.bootstrap. You must use the ng-app directive.
- Default configuration is suitable for many applications, for others customizing
  the configuration can enable new features.
- Requires URL rewriting on server side
- Base href must be set in the HTML head for proper functioning
- Using this mode requires URL rewriting on server side.
- Whitespace is generally insignificant except as part of the actual message text
  that occurs in curly braces.
- AngularJS 1.3 has dropped support for IE8.
- A subset of the AngularJS functionality may work on these browsers, but it is up
  to you to test and decide whether it works for your particular app.
- The project currently supports and will attempt to fix bugs for IE9 and above.
- Updating to 1.8.0 from 1.7.x should be a straightforward process and is highly recommended.
- AngularJS 1.8 is a breaking change release from 1.7 to mitigate a security issue.
- Pre-assigning bindings on component/directive controller instances is disabled by
  default.
- Consecutive text nodes will always get merged on IE11.
- The default hash-prefix used for $location hash-bang URLs has changed from the empty
  string to the bang.
- Aligning jqLite with the latest version of jQuery (3.x)
- Disabling (by default) the pre-assignment of bindings on controller instances
- Whitespace in attributes is no longer trimmed automatically.
- Using interpolation in any `on*` event attribute will now throw the `nodomevents`
  error at compile time.
- All JSONP requests now require the URL to be trusted as a resource URL.
- Getting/setting boolean attributes will no longer take the corresponding properties
  into account.
- You can no longer use the JSON_CALLBACK placeholder in your JSONP requests.
- The ngAria-enhanced directives will not apply ARIA attributes to native inputs,
  unless necessary.
- jqLite will camelCase the keys passed to the .data() method
- jqLite will camelCase the keys passed to .css()
- Getting/setting boolean attributes will no longer take the corresponding properties
  into account
- Calling .attr(attrName, '') will no longer remove the attribute
- Calling .attr(attrName, null) will remove the attribute
- Calling the .val() getter on a jqLite element representing a <select multiple> element
  with no options chosen will return an empty array
- IE8 is no longer supported.
- FormController now defines its methods on its prototype.
- The checked status of radio inputs is now determined by strict comparison.
- AngularJS versions 1.1.x are considered 'experimental' with breaking changes between
  minor releases.
- Version 1.2 is the result of several versions on the 1.1 branch, and has a stable
  API.
- If you relied on aria-multiline="true" being automatically added by ngAria, you
  need to apply it yourself.
- The ngAnimate module provides support for CSS-based animations as well as JavaScript-based
  animations via callback hooks.
- Be aware that this change also uses a feature that is not compatible with IE8.
- The ngTouch module provides helpers for touch-enabled devices.
- The implementation is based on jQuery Mobile touch event handling.
- The `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly
  since ngAnimate will always remove the CSS class once an animation has completed.
- The ngTouch module with the $swipe service and the ngSwipeLeft and ngSwipeRight
  directives are deprecated. Instead, stand-alone libraries for touch handling and
  gesture interaction should be used.
- Uses CSS classes to drive animations.
- Animations occur when .selected class is added or removed.
- The ng module is loaded by default when an AngularJS application is started.
- The ngAria module provides support for common ARIA attributes that convey state
  or semantic information about the application for users of assistive technologies,
  such as screen readers.
- Provides a convenient wrapper for reading and writing browser cookies.
- Includes the `angular-mocks.js` file automatically adds the `ngMock` module.
- Includes the angular-mocks.js file automatically adds the ngMock module, so your
  tests are ready to go!
- this is not an injectable instance, just a globally available mock class of `Date`.
- Scope type decorated with helper methods useful for testing.
- This function is also published on window for easy access.
- This function is declared ONLY WHEN running tests with jasmine or mocha.
- The ngResource module provides interaction support with RESTful services via the
  $resource service.
- The ngSanitize module provides functionality to sanitize HTML.
