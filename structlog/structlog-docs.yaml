notes:
- Since sys.exc_clear() has been dropped in Python 3, there is currently no way to
  avoid multiple tracebacks in your log files if using structlog together with Twisted
  on Python 3
- structlog currently only supports the legacy – but still perfectly working – Twisted
  logging system found in twisted.python.log
- The drawback of EventAdapter approach is that Twisted will format your exceptions
  as multi-line log entries which is painful to parse
- Should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for standard library's logging
- Requires configuration of both structlog and the logging system
- Uses logging.basicConfig with format='%(message)s' for basic setup
