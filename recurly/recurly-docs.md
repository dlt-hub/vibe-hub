In this guide, we'll set up a complete Recurly data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def recurly_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.recurly.com/v2/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "apikey",
                "api_key": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "accounts",
            "coupons",
            "subscriptions"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='recurly_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='recurly_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(recurly_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from recurly‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Accounts: Manage and retrieve account details.
- Billing: Access and manage billing information and coupon redemptions.
- Subscriptions: Manage and retrieve subscription details, including changes to subscriptions.
- Invoices: Retrieve invoices, line items, and associated credit payments.
- Plans and Add-Ons: Manage and retrieve plans and their add-ons.
- Coupons: Manage and retrieve coupons, including bulk unique coupons.
- Transactions: Retrieve transaction information.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Recurly workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@recurly-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Recurly support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:recurly duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Recurly API, as specified in @recurly-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "accounts" and "coupons" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in recurly_pipeline.py and name the pipeline recurly_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python recurly_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done via API Key. The key needs to be included in the request header. It is important to ensure the API Key is valid and active, and appropriately restricted for security.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://recurly.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python recurly_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline recurly load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset recurly_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/recurly.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline recurly_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("recurly_pipeline").dataset()
   # get accounts table as Pandas frame
   data.accounts.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Requires a Recurly Account and an API Key for access, and it's advised to create a restricted, read-only key for secure access. It's also important to handle potential API errors like 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, and 429 Too Many Requests by verifying API key validity, endpoint paths, and implementing rate limiting or backoff strategies respectively.
