auth_info:
- information_source; https://c4k3.github.io/wiki.vg/Authentication.html:
  - Minecraft API uses token-based authentication with accessToken and optional clientToken
    sent in the request payload. The accessToken must be obtained through prior authentication
    and is validated via the /validate endpoint; a clientToken may be provided to
    match the token used during initial authentication.
  - The API uses a token-based authentication system where clients must provide an
    accessToken in the request payload, and the server responds with a new accessToken
    (invalidating the previous one) along with a clientToken that must match the one
    sent in the request. The accessToken is a hexadecimal string used to authenticate
    subsequent API calls.

  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the format "Authorization: Bearer <access token>" for endpoints that require authentication,
    such as uploading and resetting skins. The access token must be obtained separately
    and is passed as a bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Authorization: Bearer <access token>" where <access token> is your
    valid access token. This applies to all skin-related endpoints (POST and PUT requests
    to /user/profile/<uuid>/skin).'
  - 'The Mojang API requires bearer token authentication. Include the access token
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <access token>" when making
    requests to change skins or access protected endpoints.'
