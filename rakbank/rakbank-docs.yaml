auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.rakbank.ae/sb/api/customer-signin-oauth-api:
  - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow is used for bank linkage. Customers authenticate
    on the Digital Banking site, receive an auth code at the redirect URL, then exchange
    it for a short-lived access token and long-lived refresh token. The access token
    is passed in the Authorization header for subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://developer.rakbank.ae/sb/api/basics:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Pass the access token in the Authorization
    header using the format "Bearer <token>" when invoking the API.
  - RAKBANK Open APIs use OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication depending on the endpoint.
    For OAuth, register an application to obtain a client ID and client secret, then
    call the OAuth API endpoint with the appropriate grant type and scope to generate
    an access token. Pass the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    <access_token>". For APIs where OAuth does not apply, pass both client ID and
    client secret in HTTP headers. Refer to the Security section of each API's documentation
    for specific security definitions, OAuth endpoints, grant types, and scopes applicable
    to that API.
  - RAKBANK Open APIs use OAuth2 bearer tokens for authentication. Invalid or expired
    OAuth tokens result in 401 Unauthorized responses, and tokens lacking required
    scopes result in 403 Forbidden responses. Send the OAuth token in the request
    headers; exact header name and token acquisition details are not specified in
    this excerpt.
- information_source; https://developer.rakbank.ae/sb/api/environments:
  - OAuth2 authentication is used for this API. The OAuth2 Authorize call is made
    to https://tpa.rakbank.ae/rb/api, while other Open API calls use https://api.rakbank.ae/rb/api.
    Client credentials will be provided after testing and certification completion.
    Store API endpoints as configurable values for environment switching.
