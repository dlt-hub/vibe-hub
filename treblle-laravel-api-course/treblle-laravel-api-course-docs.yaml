notes:
- Every API should have a meaningful purpose.
- Register, update, or delete services you want to monitor.
- API Platform for Laravel isn’t a fully stable release yet, but it's worth exploring.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When it comes to API security, think of it not as a threat but as an opportunity—a
  chance to build robust, multilayered defenses around your API.
- Laravel 11 has some fantastic built-in features to make your API safer, but there
  are also extra layers you can implement, including authentication, authorization,
  and advanced security headers.
- Securing your API isn’t a one-time task.
- Laravel 11 provides robust internationalization (i18n) features to manage multilingual
  support effortlessly.
- Laravel supports a variety of awesome databases, including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
  and SQL Server.
- When handling requests that could return extensive lists of resources, it's essential
  to implement pagination to ensure your responses are manageable and user-friendly.
- Deciding which pagination method to use depends on your application’s needs.
- TypeSense offers real-time search results and fast indexing.
