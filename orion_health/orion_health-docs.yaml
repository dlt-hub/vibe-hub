auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.orionhealth.io/apis/amadeus/:
  - All Amadeus APIs use OAuth2 for authentication over HTTPS. To authenticate, obtain
    an access token by logging into your developer account, creating an app, and using
    the Demo User credentials provided in your app details. Include the access token
    in API requests by replacing the `<Access Token>` placeholder. Tokens expire and
    must be regenerated by repeating the login process.

  - OAuth2 access token-based authentication is required. Obtain an access token by
    logging into the developer portal, creating an app, and using the "Get an Access
    Token" link with demo user credentials. Replace the `<Access Token>` placeholder
    in API requests with the generated token. Tokens expire and must be regenerated
    by repeating the token generation process.
