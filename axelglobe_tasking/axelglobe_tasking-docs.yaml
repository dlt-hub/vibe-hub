auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.axelglobe.com/en/stac/getting-started:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE}" where YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
    is replaced with your actual access token.'
  - 'Authorization via Bearer token in the Authorization header. Send the access token
    as "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE}" where YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
    is replaced with your actual access token value.'
  - AxelGlobe STAC API uses OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Flow for authentication.
    Obtain an access token by posting client_id and client_secret to https://auth.axelglobe.com/oauth/token
    with grant_type "client_credentials" and audience "https://api.axelglobe.com".
    The response contains access_token (valid 24 hours), expires_in (86400 seconds),
    and token_type ("Bearer"). Include the access token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer ${access_token}" when requesting API resources. Frequent unnecessary
    token requests may trigger rate limiting.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE}"
    when making requests to the STAC search endpoint.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ${YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE}" when making requests to the
    STAC API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.axelglobe.com/en/stac/getting-started:
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter (default or example value shown as 5)
    to control page size. Response structure for pagination navigation is not described
    in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter in the URL. The response includes a links
    array with a rel="next" entry containing the href for the next page. Continue
    paginating by following the next link until it is no longer present in the response.
  - The search endpoint accepts a query parameter `limit` (optional, default appears
    to be unspecified) to control the number of results returned per request. The
    response is a FeatureCollection with a `features` array containing the paginated
    items. No pagination navigation fields (such as `next`, `cursor`, or `has_more`)
    are shown in the provided response example, so the pagination mechanism is unclear
    from this documentation.
- information_source; https://docs.axelglobe.com/en/stac/openapi:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with a "next" link in the response. To paginate,
    extract the "href" value from the links array where "rel" is "next" and use it
    as the URL for the subsequent request. Stop paginating when no "next" link is
    present in the response.
- information_source; https://docs.axelglobe.com/en/tasking/openapi.html:
  - Pagination is supported via limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    is a positive integer specifying the maximum number of results per request, and
    offset is a non-negative integer specifying the starting position. The response
    returns a FeatureCollection with features array containing the paginated results.
