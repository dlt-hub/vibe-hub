notes:
- Keep GestureHandlerRootView as close to the actual root of the app as possible.
- If you're using gesture handler in your component library, you may want to wrap
  your library's code in the GestureHandlerRootView component.
- Wrap your app with `GestureHandlerRootView` component
- The legacy web implementation will be dropped in the next major release of Gesture
  Handler
- Manual gestures allow for tracking multiple pointers on the screen.
- Maximum number of touches tracked is 12.
- Changing `enabled` prop during a gesture has no effect, only when a gesture starts
  (that is a finger touches the screen) the `enabled` prop is taken into consideration
  to decide whether to extract (or not) the gesture and provide it with stream of
  events to analyze.
- '`Native` gesture may not conform to the standard state flow due to platform specific
  workarounds to incorporate native views into RNGH.'
- Keep in mind that `Touchables` from RNGH are rendering two additional views that
  may need to be styled separately to achieve desired effect (`style` and `containerStyle`
  props).
- In order for the gesture composition to work, all composed gestures must be attached
  to the same `GestureHandlerRootView`.
- Gesture Handler 1 required you to override `createRootView` to return an instance
  of `RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView`. This class has been the cause of many hard
  to debug and fix crashed and was deprecated in version 2.0, and subsequently removed
  in version 2.4.
- GestureDetector is not compatible with the Animated API nor with Reanimated 1.
- Using the same instance of a gesture across multiple Gesture Detectors is not possible.
- Gesture Detector will use first native view in its subtree to recognize gestures,
  however if this view is used only to group its children it may get automatically
  collapsed.
- A continuous gesture that can recognize a panning (dragging) gesture and track its
  movement.
- Configurations such as a minimum initial distance, specific vertical or horizontal
  pan detection and number of fingers required for activation may be specified.
- Default value for activeCursor is set to 'auto'
- This API provides methods for handling gesture events.
- Minimum number of pointers required to activate is 1.
- Maximum duration to release after a touch is 500 ms.
- Maximum delay for the next tap is 500 ms.
- Default number of taps required to activate is 1.
- Default for shouldCancelWhenOutside is true.
- Minimum number of pointers required to activate the gesture is 1.
- Maximum time finger must be released after touch is 500 ms.
- Maximum time before the next tap is 500 ms.
- Default number of tap gestures required to activate is 1.
- Default value for shouldCancelWhenOutside is true.
- Minimum time for a long press is 500 ms.
- Maximum distance for a long press is 10 points.
- Minimum time for long press is 500 ms.
- Maximum distance allowed during long press is 10 points.
- Default mouse button is set to LEFT.
- When implementing rotation based on anchor point, make sure to use it after gesture
  has activated.
- A continuous gesture that recognizes pinch gesture.
- The distance between the fingers is reported as a scale factor.
- When implementing pinch based on focal point, make sure to use it after gesture
  has activated, i.e. in onStart, onUpdate or onChange callbacks.
- A discrete gesture that activates when the movement is sufficiently long and fast.
- Don't rely on `Hover` gesture to continue after the mouse button is clicked or the
  stylus touches the screen.
- ForceTouch gesture is deprecated and will be removed in the future version of Gesture
  Handler.
- There's no implementation provided on Android and it simply renders children without
  any wrappers.
- Since this behaviour is only provided on some iOS devices, this gesture should not
  be used for defining any crucial behaviors.
- A plain gesture that has no specific activation criteria nor event data set.
- Its state has to be controlled manually using a state manager.
- In order to make buttons accessible, you have to wrap your children in a View with
  accessible and accessibilityRole="button" props.
- This library allows to use native components with native feedback in adequate situations.
- In order to make buttons accessible, wrap your children in a View with accessible
  and accessibilityRole='button' props.
- It's normally is not recommended to use, but it might be useful if we want to wrap
  it using Animated or Reanimated.
- This component is deprecated. Please use the reanimated version.
- Cross-platform replacement for the React Native's DrawerLayoutAndroid component.
- This component is a drop-in replacement for the Swipeable component, rewritten using
  Reanimated.
- The old API will be removed in the future version of Gesture Handler. Please migrate
  to gestures API instead.
- Directly nesting two gesture handlers using Animated.event is not currently supported.
- Handlers depend on their native child components.
- The old API will be removed in the future version of Gesture Handler.
- Simultaneous recognition needs to be used when implementing a photo preview component
  that supports zooming (scaling), rotating, and panning.
- Handler gets ACTIVE when movement is sufficiently long and it does not take too
  much time.
- Handlers do not instantiate native views but instead hook up to their child views.
- This component allows for implementing swipeable rows or similar interaction.
- It renders its children within a panable container allowing for horizontal swiping
  left and right.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This is documentation for React Native Gesture Handler 1.x, which is no longer actively
  maintained.
- A discrete gesture handler that activates when the corresponding view is pressed
  for a sufficiently long time.
- The handler will fail to recognize a touch event if the finger is lifted before
  the minimum required time or if the finger is moved further than the allowable distance.
- The handler is implemented using UIPinchGestureRecognizer on iOS and from scratch
  on Android.
- This handler should not be used for defining any crucial behaviors.
- Use it only as an additional improvement and make all features to be accessed without
  this handler as well.
- Minimum number of pointers required is 1
- Maximum time for finger release is 500 ms
- Maximum time before next tap is 500 ms
- Number of tap gestures required is 1
- Minimum time for long press is 500ms
- Maximum distance for long press is 10 points
- This is a cross-platform replacement for React Native's DrawerLayoutAndroid component.
- Gesture handler library provides native components that can act as buttons.
- In order to make buttons accessible, you have to wrap your children in a View with
  accessible and accessibilityRole='button' props.
errors:
- 'Multiple instances of Gesture Handler were detected: This error usually happens
  when in your project there exists more than one instance of Gesture Handler.'
- If the pressure is greater than maxForce, gesture fails.
- Handler fails if pressure is greater than maxForce.
- Handler fails if pressure is greater than maxForce
