- information_source; https://helidon.io/docs/v4/mp/guides/security-oidc:
  - OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant is used for direct token requests.
    Send credentials via POST to the Access Token URL with Grant Type "Password Credentials",
    providing Client ID, Client Secret (via Basic Auth Header), Username, Password,
    and Scope "openid". The server returns an access token and refresh token; include
    the access token in subsequent requests using the Authorization header with "bearer"
    prefix. Role-based access control is enforced via @RolesAllowed annotations on
    endpoints.
  - 'OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with Keycloak. Step 1: redirect user to Keycloak
    auth endpoint at http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth
    with query parameters client_id=myClientID and response_type=code. Step 2: receive
    authorization code from Keycloak redirect. Step 3: POST to http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/protocol/openid-connect/token
    with x-www-form-urlencoded body containing grant_type=authorization_code, client_id=myClientID,
    client_secret=(your client secret), and code=(received authorization code). Response
    includes access_token and refresh_token. Access token lifespan can be increased.
    Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Direct Access Grants) flow is also
    available for REST clients requesting tokens on behalf of users.'
- information_source; https://helidon.io/docs/v4/mp/jwt:
  - JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is required. Tokens are obtained from an external
    issuer and sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}". Configuration
    requires setting mp.jwt.verify.issuer to the issuer's OAuth2 endpoint and mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location
    to the issuer's public key endpoint. The application is annotated with @LoginConfig(authMethod
    = "MP-JWT") to enable JWT verification.
- information_source; https://helidon.io/docs/v4/mp/security/providers:
  - Authentication to the identity server token endpoint uses one of several client
    authentication methods configured via the `token-endpoint-auth` parameter. Supported
    methods include CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC (HTTP Basic auth with client credentials,
    the default), CLIENT_SECRET_POST (client credentials in request body), CLIENT_SECRET_JWT
    (HMAC-signed JWT), PRIVATE_KEY_JWT (asymmetrically-signed JWT), CLIENT_CERTIFICATE
    (mutual TLS), and NONE (no authentication). JWT validation uses public keys from
    a JWK resource specified by `sign-jwk.resource`. Scope requests are prefixed with
    a configurable string via the scope-prefix parameter.
  - 'Multiple OAuth 2.0 client authentication methods are supported at the token endpoint:
    CLIENT_SECRET_JWT (HMAC SHA-256 signed JWT using client_secret as shared key),
    PRIVATE_KEY_JWT (RSA signed JWT using registered public key), CLIENT_CERTIFICATE
    (mutual TLS), or NONE (public clients). JWT authentication requires iss, sub,
    aud, jti, exp claims (required) and optionally iat. The token endpoint URI defaults
    to oidcMetadata or identityUri/oauth2/v1/token if not explicitly defined.'
