notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- A placeholder can be satisfied by uploading a file to the location URI.
- To prevent exceeding service timeouts or payload limits, some endpoints are throttled
  in both execution time and in the size of its response payload--e.g., to a maximum
  execution time of 15 seconds and a maximum payload of 9 MB.
errors:
