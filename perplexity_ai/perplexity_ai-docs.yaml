notes:
- Async requests have a time-to-live (TTL) of 7 days.
- Responses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.
- API keys are sensitive credentials. Never expose them in client-side code or share
  them in public repositories.
- Best suited for quick factual queries, topic summaries, product comparisons, and
  current events where simple information retrieval and synthesis is needed without
  complex reasoning.
- Not ideal for multi-step analyses, exhaustive research on broad topics, or projects
  requiring detailed instructions or comprehensive reports across multiple sources.
