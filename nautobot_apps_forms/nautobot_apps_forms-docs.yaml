auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/configuration/settings/:
  - Remote user authentication is configured via HTTP headers. The `REMOTE_AUTH_HEADER`
    setting specifies which HTTP header contains the authenticated username (default
    is `HTTP_REMOTE_USER`). When a request header like `X-Remote-User` is used, the
    setting must be set to `HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER`. The `REMOTE_AUTH_AUTO_CREATE_USER`
    setting controls whether local user accounts are automatically created for remotely
    authenticated users.
- information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/guides/prometheus-metrics/:
  - Metrics endpoints do not require authentication by default, but authentication
    can be enabled by setting the METRICS_AUTHENTICATION configuration to True. When
    enabled, users must either be logged in or provide an API token via the Authorization
    header in the format "Token <token_value>". See REST API Authentication documentation
    for details on API token acquisition.
- information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/core-data-model/ipam/vlangroup/:
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your authentication token.
    The token should be passed as a Bearer-style header with the word "Token" followed
    by the actual token value.'
  - Token-based authentication is required. Include an Authorization header with the
    value "Token $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your API token. The token should be passed
    in the Authorization header for all requests.
  - Token-based authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the format "Token $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your API token. The header name is "Authorization"
    and the scheme is "Token" followed by a space and the token value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/feature-guides/graphql/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes count
    (total items), next (URL for next page), previous (URL for previous page), and
    results array. Construct subsequent requests using the next/previous URLs or manually
    increment offset by limit value; stop when next is null.
- information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/platform-functionality/rest-api/overview/:
  - List endpoints return paginated responses with `count` (total objects), `next`
    (hyperlink to next page), `previous` (hyperlink to previous page), and `results`
    (current page objects). Pagination uses `limit` and `offset` query parameters;
    construct the next request using the `next` hyperlink from the response, or stop
    when `next` is null.
- ? information_source; https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/platform-functionality/rest-api/authentication/
  : - The response includes count, next, previous, and results fields. The next field
      indicates the URL for the next page (null when no more pages exist), and previous
      indicates the prior page URL, enabling cursor-based pagination navigation.
