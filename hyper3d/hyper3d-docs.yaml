  - 'Authorization uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The API
    key should be set as the RODIN_API_KEY environment variable and sent via the Authorization:
    Bearer RODIN_API_KEY header. Additionally, a subscription_key parameter is required
    in the POST request body to specify which task status to query.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization header with
    the format "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN". Additionally, the request body must contain
    a subscription_key field as a required string parameter.
  - 'The API uses a two-part authentication scheme: a Bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header and a subscription key passed in the request body. Include the header Authorization:
    Bearer {API_KEY} where API_KEY is your actual API key, and include the JSON field
    subscription_key with your subscription key value in the POST request body.'
  - 'This API uses bearer token authentication. Include a valid API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer RODIN_API_KEY" for all requests. The API key
    can be generated from your account via the Quickstart section.'

  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send your API key in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer RODIN_API_KEY`. The API key can be stored in
