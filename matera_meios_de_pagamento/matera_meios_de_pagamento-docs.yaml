auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc-api.matera.com/mp_server.html:
  - A valid OAuth2 access token is required and must be provided in the Authorization
    header. Additionally, a Transaction-Hash header is required, which is calculated
    from the boleto barcode or typeable line. The access token must be valid; requests
    with invalid or missing tokens will receive a 401 response.
  - A valid OAuth2 access token must be provided in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}". Additionally, a Transaction-Hash header is required, computed as the
    lowercase HTTP method name, request path, limitType, and amount (integer part)
    joined by colons.
  - 'A valid OAuth2 access token must be provided in the Authorization header as a
    Bearer token. Additionally, a Transaction-Hash header is required, which is a
    hash computed from specific transaction fields concatenated in a defined order:
    receivedAmount (integer part), transactionType, billingIdentifier.transactionId,
    status, recipient.accountId, recipient.amount (integer part).'
  - A valid OAuth2 access token must be provided in the Authorization header with
    the format "Bearer {token}". Additionally, a Transaction-Hash header is required,
    computed as the lowercase HTTP method name, request path, and alias separated
    by colons, then hashed.
  - A valid OAuth2 access token must be provided in the Authorization header. Additionally,
    a Transaction-Hash header is required, computed as the lowercase HTTP method name,
    request path, and alias.name separated by colons (e.g., post:/v1/accounts/1CDD2D73-E641-8CF6-51AC-065F01CD7422/aliases:email@example.com).
pagination_info:
- information_source; http://doc-api.matera.com/ibk_edge.html:
  - Pagination uses query parameters size (integer >= 1, required) for page size and
    page (integer >= 0, required) for current page number. Response includes a data
    object with content array and pageable metadata containing sort information; continue
    paginating by incrementing the page parameter until no more results are returned.
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters: size (integer, >= 1, required page size) and
    page (integer, >= 0, required page number). The response includes a data array
    with paginated results. Stop paginating when the returned data array is empty
    or contains fewer items than the requested size.'
- information_source; http://doc-api.matera.com/ibk_server.html:
  - Pagination is used in the GET /api/v1/settlements endpoint with query parameters
    pageSize and pageNumber. pageSize specifies the number of results per page and
    pageNumber specifies which page to retrieve, both as query parameters. The documentation
    does not specify response fields indicating total pages, has_more flags, or navigation
    cursors.
  - Pagination uses offset-based parameters with pageNumber and pageSize in the pageable
    request object. Response includes pageable object with pageNumber, pageSize, offset,
    and boolean fields (paged, unpaged), plus totalPages, totalElements, last, and
    first fields to indicate pagination state and position within results.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters with response metadata. Request parameters:
    pageNumber (page index, optional, default 0) and pageSize (items per page, optional,
    default 0) in query string. Response includes pageable object with pageNumber,
    pageSize, offset; totalPages, totalElements, numberOfElements, size, and boolean
    flags first, last, empty to indicate pagination state.'
