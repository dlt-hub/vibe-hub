auth_info:
- information_source; https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/api/api-documentation:
  - API requests must include a `timestamp` parameter (millisecond timestamp when
    the request was created) and may include a `recvWindow` parameter (milliseconds
    after timestamp the request is valid for; defaults to 5000). The server validates
    that the timestamp is within 1000ms of server time and the request age does not
    exceed recvWindow. Additionally, requests use HMAC SHA256 signature for authentication,
    with the signature computed over the request parameters and sent as part of the
    signed payload. An `apiKey` and `secretKey` are required to generate the HMAC
    SHA256 signature.
  - API-keys are passed via the X-MBX-APIKEY header and are case sensitive. TRADE
    and USER_DATA endpoints require HMAC SHA256 signatures computed from the secretKey
    and totalParams (query string concatenated with request body), sent in the query
    string or request body. SIGNED endpoints also require a timestamp parameter in
    milliseconds and optionally a recvWindow parameter. USER_STREAM and MARKET_DATA
    endpoints require only a valid API-Key. API-keys can be restricted to specific
    endpoint types like TRADE only.
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC SHA256 signatures with an API key header. Include the
    API key in the X-MBX-APIKEY header, compute an HMAC SHA256 signature of the query
    string or request body using your secret key, and append the signature parameter
    to the request URL or body.


    Key details: Header name is X-MBX-APIKEY, signature algorithm is HMAC SHA256,
    signature parameter name is signature, include timestamp and recvWindow in the
    signed data.'
  - Requests require HMAC SHA256 signature authentication. Include the API key in
    the X-MBX-APIKEY header. Generate the signature by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the
    concatenated query string and request body using your secret key, then append
    the signature parameter to the request body.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/api/api-documentation:
  - The endpoint accepts optional limit parameter (INT, default 500, max 1000) to
    control results returned per request. fromId (LONG, optional) retrieves trades
    from a specific aggregate trade ID onwards, enabling pagination by using the last
    tradeId from a previous response as the next fromId.
  - limit is an optional query parameter with default value 500 and maximum value
    1500, controlling how many kline records are returned per request. No explicit
    next page mechanism is described; use startTime and endTime parameters to retrieve
    different time ranges sequentially.
