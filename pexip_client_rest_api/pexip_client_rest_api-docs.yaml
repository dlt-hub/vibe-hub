auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm:
  - 'PIN-based access control is used for conference joins: provide a "pin" HTTP header
    with the conference PIN, or "none" if joining as a Guest when PIN is not required
    for Guests; a 403 Forbidden error is returned if the PIN is incorrect or missing.
    For SSO-protected conferences, the response includes available Identity Providers
    (IdPs) with name, img, and uuid fields; subsequent requests must include the chosen_idp
    field, and the response provides a redirect_url with a Base64-encoded SAML AuthNRequest
    for IdP authentication.'
  - SAML and OpenID Connect authentication is used. After redirecting to an Identity
    Provider (Microsoft Entra ID or similar) and completing authentication, a SAML
    Assertion or OpenID Connect JWT is returned to Infinity API for verification.
    Upon successful verification, a token is issued that must be sent as the sso_token
    parameter in subsequent request_token calls. Tokens can be refreshed via the refresh_token
    POST endpoint to obtain a new token with an updated expiration time.
  - Session token authentication is required. Pass the session token as a query parameter
    named "token" in the URL (e.g., ?token=<token_id>) when connecting to the EventSource
    endpoint at /api/client/v2/conferences/<conference_alias>/events. Alternatively,
    the token can be sent as a custom header if the client supports it.
- information_source; https://docs.pexip.com/api_manage/using.htm:
  - OAuth and LDAP can be used independently or together for authentication. Any access
    not using OAuth requires HTTP Basic Authentication over HTTPS, where credentials
    are the admin web username and password for the Management Node (default username
    is admin). When using the requests library in Python, pass the username and password
    as a tuple to the auth parameter.
