notes:
- Uses JSON to store array attributes
- Attribute values must be JSON serializable
- Retrieving data from a remote service via the network can be significantly slower
  than retrieving data from a local file system.
- Consolidating metadata can greatly increase the speed of reading the array metadata.
- Creating an array with write_empty_chunks=False prevents storing redundant objects.
- Creating an array with write_empty_chunks=True will write every chunk without checking
  for emptiness.
- When creating an array with write_empty_chunks=False, Zarr will check whether a
  chunk is empty before compression and storage.
- If you know that your data will form chunks that are almost always non-empty, then
  creating an array with write_empty_chunks=True will instruct Zarr to write every
  chunk without checking for emptiness.
- End Python 3.5 support.
- This release of Zarr Python is the first release of Zarr to not support Python 3.5.
- The software is provided 'as is', without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
- Zarr depends on NumPy.
- Zarr has endorsed Scientific-Python SPEC 0 and now follows the version support window.
