auth_info:
- information_source; https://simpleidserver.com/docs/5.0.2/tutorial/delegation/:
  - JWT Bearer token authentication. The API requires a valid JWT token issued by
    "https://localhost:5001/master" with audience "shopApi" and issuer "https://localhost:5001/master".
    Tokens are validated via the JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme and passed
    in the Authorization header. The Authorize attribute enforces the "Shops" policy
    requiring an authenticated user.
- information_source; https://simpleidserver.com/docs/6.0.3/tutorial/delegation/:
  - JWT Bearer token authentication. The API requires a valid JWT token issued by
    "https://localhost:5001/master" with audience "shopApi" in the Authorization header.
    Token validation checks both the issuer and audience claims. The Authorize attribute
    enforces authentication on protected endpoints.
- information_source; https://simpleidserver.com/docs/tutorial/ciba/:
  - Client authentication for CIBA uses TLS client certificate authentication (tls_client_auth).
    The client must be a Confidential Client and authenticate by presenting a client
    certificate during TLS handshake to the Token endpoint when requesting access
    tokens via CIBA polling.
- information_source; https://simpleidserver.com/docs/tutorial/delegation/:
  - The API uses JWT bearer token authentication with OAuth2 token-exchange grant
    type. Tokens are validated against issuer "https://localhost:5001/master" and
    audience "shopApi". Send the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {token}". The token-exchange grant uses client credentials with clientId "firstDelegationAPi"
    and clientSecret "password" to obtain tokens for the "shopApiOther" scope. The
    Shops policy requires authenticated users.
