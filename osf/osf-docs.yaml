auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.osf.io/:
  - OAuth2 application credentials are used for authentication. The client_id (e.g.,
    "client_abc123") is required as a path parameter to retrieve application details,
    and the client_secret (e.g., "secret_123") is provided during application registration
    for use in OAuth2 token exchange flows. The callback_url specifies where OAuth2
    authorization responses are sent.
  - OAuth2 applications can be managed via API endpoints. The client_id is required
    as a path parameter for deactivating or resetting applications. Resetting an application
    (POST to /applications/{client_id}/reset/) generates a new client_secret value
    and revokes all associated tokens; this endpoint is deprecated in API v2.14+.
  - To use Personal Access Token authentication, include an Authorization header with
    the value Bearer <token>, where <token> is your Personal Access Token. The header
    name is Authorization and the scheme is Bearer.
  - To use a Personal Access Token, include an Authorization header with the value
    Bearer <token>, where <token> is your token created from the OSF settings page.
    Alternatively, the OSF supports OAuth 2.0 web application flow for third-party
    applications, which requires registering a developer application in OSF settings
    and following the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.
  - User must be authenticated to access this endpoint. The documentation states that
    the user must be authenticated and have permissions to view actions associated
    with the respective resources. A 403 Forbidden response is returned if the user
    does not have permission to view the review actions.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.osf.io/:
  - 'Entity collection endpoints return paginated results with a maximum of 10 entities
    per page. The response includes a `data` array of entities and a `links` object
    containing pagination URLs: `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`. The `meta` object
    provides `total` entity count and current results per page. When results fit one
    page, `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` are null. Use the `next` link URL to
    fetch the subsequent page.'
  - Pagination is supported via the `links` key in responses, which contains links
    for navigation as described in the [pagination documentation](https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Pagination).
    The `data` key returns up to 10 nodes per request.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (default 10 items per page). Response includes
    links.next, links.prev, links.first, links.last URLs for navigation, plus links.meta.total
    (total items) and links.meta.per_page (items per page).
  - Pagination uses offset-limit style with total and per_page fields in the response.
    The links object contains self, first, last, prev, and next fields for navigation,
    where null values indicate unavailable pages. Stop paginating when next is null.
  - Pagination uses the JSON:API specification with query parameters page (page number)
    and per_page (number of actions per page). Response includes data, meta, and links
    objects following JSON:API pagination format for navigating results.
