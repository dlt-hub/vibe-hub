auth_info:
- information_source; https://getnametag.com/docs/api/:
  - API key authentication is required for this endpoint. Send the API key as specified
    in the API key authentication section (details not provided in this excerpt).
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key via the `Authorization` header
    or as a query parameter (exact header/parameter name not specified in this excerpt,
    but referenced as [API key](#api-key) section). The API key must be provided to
    authenticate requests to the POST endpoint at https://nametag.co/people/:subject/compare.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). Client
    authentication uses client_id and client_secret sent as form data in the POST
    body to the PAR endpoint. The PAR endpoint returns a request_uri that is then
    passed as a query parameter to the authorize endpoint, which requires no authentication.
  - The Nametag API uses OAuth2 for authentication. To initialize a request, POST
    to the `/oauth2/par` endpoint with form parameters including client_id, client_secret,
    redirect_uri, scope (space-separated, must include openid), and claims as a JSON
    string. The client_secret must be provisioned in the OAuth section of the Nametag
    console and is required for authentication.
  - 'The authentication method is HTTP Basic Auth using an API key. The API key is
    passed as the username in the Authorization header (with an empty password), formatted
    as `-u :$APIKEY` in curl, which translates to the header `Authorization: Basic
    base64(":$APIKEY")` where APIKEY is the actual API key value.'
