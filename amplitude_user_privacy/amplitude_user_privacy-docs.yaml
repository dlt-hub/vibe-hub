auth_info:
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis:
  - Amplitude API uses API key and secret key authentication. The api_key and secret_key
    credentials are required and should be provided in requests (typically as query
    parameters or in the request body, depending on the specific endpoint). Refer
    to the authentication documentation at amplitude.com/docs/apis/authentication
    to retrieve your project's API key.
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/analytics/batch-event-upload:
  - The API requires an api_key parameter in the JSON request body for authentication.
    Include the api_key field with your Amplitude API key value in the POST request
    body sent to the batch endpoint.
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/analytics/behavioral-cohorts:
  - Amplitude API uses HTTP Basic Authentication for cohort upload endpoints. Credentials
    must be base64 encoded and sent in the Authorization header as "Basic {base64(api-key:secret-key)}".
    The api-key and secret-key are separated by a colon before encoding. Alternatively,
    use the -u flag with curl as -u '{api_key}:{secret_key}'.
  - Amplitude API uses HTTP Basic authentication. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header as "Basic" followed by base64-encoded "api-key:secret-key". The api-key
    and secret-key must be base64 encoded together in the format api-key:secret-key.
  - Authorization uses HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded credentials. The Authorization
    header must be formatted as "Basic {base64-encoded-api-key:secret-key}" where
    api-key and secret-key are base64 encoded together in the format api-key:secret-key.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/analytics/dashboard-rest:
  - Pagination uses optional offset and limit query parameters. offset is zero-indexed
    for starting position, limit specifies number of events to return, and direction
    controls sort order (earliest or latest). Response contains events array and userData
    object.
  - The API supports pagination via an optional "limit" query parameter that controls
    the number of results returned. However, the documentation does not specify the
    default value, maximum allowed value, or how to navigate to subsequent pages (such
    as offset, cursor, or next_page fields in the response).
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/experiment/experiment-management-api-experiments:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with limit and cursor query parameters.
    The limit parameter controls the maximum number of experiments returned per request,
    and the cursor parameter specifies the offset to start from in the result set.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a limit query parameter. Use limit to
    control page size (example shows limit=1000). The response returns a list of experiments
    in an "experiments" array; continue paginating by incrementing the offset parameter
    in subsequent requests until fewer results than the limit are returned.
- information_source; https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/experiment/experiment-management-api-version-endpoints:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with query parameters limit (max number
    of results) and cursor (offset to start from). The response includes a nextCursor
    field to retrieve the next page, and versions are ordered by creation time descending.
