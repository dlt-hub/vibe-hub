notes:
- Maestro supports a minimal subset of vanilla JavaScript APIs with some purpose-built
  Maestro extensions.
- Currently, Maestro by default uses the Rhino JavaScript runtime to execute JavaScript,
  which has very limited modern JavaScript support.
- Setting a 'Content-Type' header might be required.
