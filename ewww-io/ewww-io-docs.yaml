notes:
- Pngout is not enabled by default because it is resource intensive.
- Optipng is the preferred PNG optimizer if you have resource (CPU) constraints.
- Pngout is also not open-source for those who care about such things, but the command-line
  version is free.
- Lazy Loading is not supported on IE8 or below, but all modern browsers are supported.
- Printing pages with lazy loaded images does not work by default, as scrolling is
  needed to load all the images.
- WordPress does not modify uploaded images prior to version 5.3.
- Premium compression averages about 5x the savings of Pixel Perfect mode.
- AVIF is not enabled by default as the encoding process is significantly slower.
- High-DPI images will not exceed the resolution/dimensions of the original image
  uploaded.
- Uses server-based and HTML-based WebP delivery methods.
- If your web host features server-level caching, you may not be able to use server-based
  rewrite rules.
- Due to continual problems with buggy plugins, this feature is off by default, but
  may be enabled via adding an override/constant to your wp-config.php file.
- Background optimization is automatically enabled in EWWW IO, but only if there is
  nothing blocking it.
- Sometimes database (object) caching will make it appear the test has failed when
  it really hasn't.
- Check server access/error logs for requests to admin-ajax.php.
errors:
- 'invalid: indicates that the key is not valid (not found)'
- 'expired: subscription has expired'
