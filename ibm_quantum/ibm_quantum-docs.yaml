auth_info:
- information_source; https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit-runtime-rest:
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>". Additionally, provide the Service-CRN header
    with your instance CRN value. The IBM-API-Version header is also required and
    should be set to "2025-05-01".
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN> in requests. Additionally,
    specify the Service-CRN header with your IBM Cloud instance CRN when submitting
    jobs to a QPU.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Generate a temporary bearer token by
    posting to https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token with grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey
    and apikey=YOUR_APIKEY in the request body. Include the returned access_token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>", and include your instance's Cloud
    Resource Name (CRN) in the Service-CRN header on all requests. Tokens expire within
    one hour (check expires_in field); generate a new token when expired.
  - Bearer token authentication with instance identification. Send Authorization header
    with Bearer token value, Service-CRN header with your instance CRN, and IBM-API-Version
    header set to 2025-05-01. All three headers are required for API requests.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header,
    along with a Service-CRN header containing your instance CRN. Include the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>" and the Service-CRN header
    as "Service-CRN: <YOUR_INSTANCE_CRN>". Additionally, include the IBM-API-Version
    header set to "2025-05-01".'
