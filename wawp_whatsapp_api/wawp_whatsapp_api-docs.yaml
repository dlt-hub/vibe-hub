auth_info:
- information_source; https://wawp.net/whatsapp-api/:
  - Access tokens are required and must be sent as a field named access_token in the
    JSON request body. The access_token value is a string like "671f38e9xxxx". Additionally,
    an instance_id parameter must be included in the request body to identify the
    API instance being accessed.
  - Authentication is performed using an access token passed as a query parameter
    named access_token in all API requests. The token value is a string like 671f38e9xxxxx
    and must be included in the URL query string for each endpoint call.
  - 'Authentication uses two credentials passed in the JSON request body: instance_id
    and access_token. Both must be included in every API request to authenticate and
    authorize the client to send messages through their WhatsApp instance.'
  - Copy your instance id and access token. The API requires these credentials to
    be sent with requests. Access the instance creation endpoint at https://app.wawp.net/api/create
    using POST method.
  - The API uses query parameter and request body authentication. Include access_token
    as a query parameter in the URL or as a field in the JSON request body, along
    with instance_id to identify the WhatsApp instance. No other auth scheme (bearer
    token, API key header, basic auth) is mentioned.
