notes:
- Beginning in November, 2024, the Stock API will only be available to Stock for Enterprise
  customers.
- Existing integrations with OAuth User authentication credentials will be in a 'read-only'
  mode until you request approval.
- The License History API only returns the currently selected profile unless 'all=true'
  is added.
- The API may return an error if a PNG with transparency does not exist.
- Free content is automatically excluded from the Search API by default.
- A value of '1' indicates a Free asset.
- The Stock API is only open to Stock for Enterprise customers and Adobe Affiliates
  at this time.
- Usage of the Stock API is free for all users.
- Adobe Stock does not currently enforce API limits.
- Standard assets require one license or credit to purchase.
- The download URL provided by the Stock API is an alias that will redirect to the
  actual location of the file.
- Access tokens have a 24-hour expiration.
- Use the size parameter to request different asset sizes.
- All License API requests must be authenticated and authorized using an access token.
- OAuth integrations always require an interactive user login--it cannot be fully
  automated.
- Authorization header is required for any of the licensing calls.
- Default is to show only history for the current user or Stock profile.
- All Adobe Stock API applications must be registered by creating an integration using
  the Adobe Developer Console.
- If you expect to see a Service Account integration and the option is not available,
  it is likely that you do not have the proper access for your organization.
- You will need to craft additional code to generate your tokens.
- Search results include only a maximum of 100 for each call (and 32 results by default).
- To create a project using a template, please follow the steps in the guide for creating
  a project using a template.
- Project title is auto-generated, can be changed later
- App name cannot be changed once the project is created
- You will need to complete a public profile before you can submit your app or integration
  for approval.
- Adobe will not contact beta users on your behalf.
- The ability to select beta users is available only for certain APIs.
- Distributing a plugin requires you to complete a public profile before you can submit
  your plugin listing.
- Adobe Developer Console supports versioning for plugins.
- Adobe Developer Console supports versioning for plugins, but attempting to add a
  new version while the current plugin is 'In Review' will result in a 'Plugin already
  in review' warning.
- Plugin submissions are reviewed by Adobe and a response is provided within 10 business
  days.
- Access to some APIs is based on licenses. Meaning either the licenses your company
  holds or your personal licenses if you are building a personal project.
- An API key is the only client credential required for these services, and integrations
  don’t need to pass an access token with each request.
- OAuth Server-to-server integration allows your application to call Adobe services
  on its own behalf.
- Adobe I/O Events allow you to receive notifications of real-time events taking place
  in Adobe services.
- You must also register a webhook by providing a Webhook URL to receive notifications
  about events.
- Adobe I/O Runtime requires a license. Please contact your Adobe sales representative
  for more details.
- Email alerts are enabled by default for all new Projects.
- Service Account (JWT) credentials have reached their end of life as of June 30,
  2025.
- Some Adobe services require authorization but do not require authentication.
- An API key is the only client credential required for these services.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Adding more users as email alert recipients is unavailable to personal developer
  organizations.
- Certificate key pairs generated on the Developer Console expire after a year.
- View and copy the Client ID, retrieve the client secret, and view the Platform type
  as well as the Redirect URL.
- offline_access scope is needed for refresh token.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Many services require a license to use.
- If the option to add the service to a project is not available, you either do not
  have an active license or permissions to access to that service.
- Enter your information carefully. You will need to contact Adobe directly to make
  any changes or updates after you have submitted your public profile as part of an
  app approval or plugin listing submission.
- Access tokens usually expire in 24 hours.
- Integrations should avoid generating a new access token when a previously generated
  access token has not expired.
- Service Account (JWT) credentials have reached their end of life and are no longer
  supported.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- As of June 30, 2025, Service Account (JWT) credentials have reached their end of
  life and are no longer supported.
- Adobe will migrate all auto-generated projects before Jun 30, 2025.
- offline_access scope is needed for refresh token to be returned.
- You do not need a refresh token for OAuth Server-to-Server credentials.
- Admin authentication enables partner-built apps to read and modify Adobe enterprise
  customer data with their explicit consent.
- The customer admin can visit the Adobe Exchange manage page to revoke consent to
  the partner app at any time.
- Rotating client secrets periodically is recommended because your application will
  deal with Adobe customer data.
- No refresh tokens are generated as the partner app can generate access tokens anytime.
- Service Account (JWT) credentials will not work after current certificates expire
  or March 1, 2026.
- Once you finish developing your app and are ready to publish, you must fill out
  listing details and submit the app for Adobe review.
- You cannot add or remove APIs connected to the Enterprise Web App credential.
- Service Account (JWT) credentials are deprecated and must be migrated to OAuth Server-to-Server
  credentials by June 30, 2025.
- The OAuth 2.0 Playground is an Adobe internet utility that enables developers to
  easily obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token for use in building and testing their integrations.
- Workspaces are currently only available when building App Builder apps using a templated
  project.
- The app name is used to generate the URL for your project.
- Rotating client secrets periodically is recommended
- No refresh tokens are generated
- Always verify the state, nonce, and signature of the ID token on the backend.
- Authorization is required for the Licensing API.
- For the Search API, Authorization is optional.
- For enterprise organizations, you must be a system administrator or developer in
  order to create projects for your organization.
- Adobe I/O Runtime is only available for enterprise customers and requires a license.
- For the Licensing API, Authorization is required.
- Categories are metadata set manually by the Stock Contributor.
- Access token needs to be sent via a URL parameter for certain methods.
- Keyword search is considered a best practice.
