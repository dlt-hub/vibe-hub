auth_info:
- information_source; https://openpostcodes.com/documentation:
  - API key authentication is required. Pass the api_key query parameter with your
    key obtained from your account area in all requests to the postcodes endpoint.
  - 'API key authentication via query parameter. Pass your unique API key as the api_key
    query parameter in every GET request to https://api.openpostcodes.com. Example:
    api_key=openpostcodes_demo. Keys are created from your account area and are instantly
    active.'
  - Authentication uses an API key passed as a query parameter. Include the api_key
    query parameter with your API key value obtained from your account area in requests
    to the API.
  - 'Every request requires a valid API key passed as the api_key query parameter.
    For example: https://api.openpostcodes.com/v1/postcodes/XA10XX?api_key=openpostcodes_demo.
    Requests without a valid API key will receive a HTTP 401 Unauthorised error. Access
    can be restricted per key using daily lookup limits, daily individual lookup limits
    by IP address, and allowed URLs.'
  - The API requires an api_key parameter to be sent with requests. Include the api_key
    as a query parameter in the request URL, for example api_key=openpostcodes_demo.
    Test data is available that does not consume your API key balance.
