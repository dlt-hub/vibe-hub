In this guide, we'll set up a complete Linnworks data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def linnworks_operations_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.linnworks.net/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "ProcessedOrders-SearchProcessedOrders",
            "Orders-GetOrdersById",
            "Stock-GetStockItemsFull"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='linnworks_operations_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='linnworks_operations_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(linnworks_operations_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from linnworks_operations‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Processed Orders: Manage and search processed orders.
- Order Details: Retrieve detailed information about specific orders.
- Stock Items: Manage and retrieve full details of stock items.
- Stock Locations: Manage and retrieve information about stock locations.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Linnworks workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@linnworks_operations-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Linnworks support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:linnworks_operations duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Linnworks API, as specified in @linnworks_operations-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "ProcessedOrders-SearchProcessedOrders" and "Orders-GetOrdersById" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in linnworks_operations_pipeline.py and name the pipeline linnworks_operations_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python linnworks_operations_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is handled via OAuth2 with a refresh token flow. Tokens are to be passed in the Authorization header using a Bearer scheme.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.linnworks.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python linnworks_operations_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline linnworks_operations load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset linnworks_operations_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/linnworks_operations.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline linnworks_operations_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("linnworks_operations_pipeline").dataset()
   # get ProcessedOrders-SearchProcessedOrders table as Pandas frame
   data.ProcessedOrders-SearchProcessedOrders.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Rate limits vary across endpoints, necessitating careful management of API calls to avoid throttling. Authentication requires correct setup of client credentials and refresh tokens.
