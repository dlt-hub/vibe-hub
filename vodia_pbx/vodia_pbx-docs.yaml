  - After logging into the PBX and obtaining a session ID (either admin or domain
    admin), include the session ID in requests to access ACD information. The session
    ID is acquired through a login process and must be provided to authenticate subsequent
    API calls for resources like the wallboard endpoint.

  - 'Vodia API uses token-based authentication. After logging in via REST API, you
    receive a token that must be sent as credentials in subsequent API calls.


    Key details: Login endpoint returns a token. This token is then used as authentication
    credentials for all other API requests. The exact header name, parameter name,
    and token format are not specified in the provided excerpt, but the documentation
    indicates examples of logging in and using the received token for API calls like
    creating/deleting extensions and configuring dial plans.'
