notes:
- The PHP Modal view model uses a fluent interface to configure the dialog.
- HEREDOC expressions incompatible with Magento built in HTML minification
- System requirements for Magento can be found in the devdocs
- A valid license for Hyvä Themes is required.
- Ensure required GraphQL modules are enabled for Hyvä.
- Use one of the three Google ReCaptcha versions supported by Magento.
- Uses HTTP Basic authentication for accessing private packagist.
- A valid license is required for Hyvä Themes.
- A node version >= 16.0.0 is required on development instances to run the tailwind
  compiler.
- We currently don’t support the old Magento captcha implementation, which is enabled
  by default.
- We generally recommend switching off the built-in minification and bundling of HTML,
  CSS and JS, as they don't benefit Hyvä sites, and even tend to harm, that is, produce
  overhead and maybe cause unwanted effects.
- Be sure to keep the settings enabled for any store views that use Luma based themes.
- Hyvä is a 'Bring your own checkout' theme. We offer three choices.
- Avoid directly cloning the Hyvä UI repository into your Magento project, especially
  within your theme.
- 'Sensitive Data: Remember that other people can often see support requests so be
  sure not to post sensitive data in support requests: customer information, passwords,
  credit card numbers, credentials etc.'
- This program is FREE and based on daily dealings with Hyvä.
- Agencies can get listed in more than 1 country if they have an actual office, at
  least 3 employees, clients in that country, and a distinct company name.
- Verify compatibility of gallery options with your Hyvä UI Library version.
- Enabling captions requires meaningful alt text.
- You can create a child theme or a duplicate theme of the hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme
  and modify that.
- Magento limits the characters that are allowed for class names in the layout XML
  schema to a subset of actually valid class names.
- Currently, Hyvä does not style emails.
- Custom styles can be applied through the module `hyva-themes/magento2-email-module`.
- Exclude _theme.less from git
- Lucas has not used this in production, but testing looks like it is working ok.
- Accessibility features were released in Hyvä 1.3.0
- To make an eCommerce store fully accessible, you need to ensure that all content
  is accessible too
- Localization modules can be installed via composer using the package name.
- Deploying a Hyvä theme requires building the production styles.css bundle.
- We recommend building the styles.css on a development, staging or build environment,
  instead of on the production host, because it requires a node.js installation.
- If you run an automated CI pipeline, use npm ci instead of npm install to install
  the tailwind dependencies.
- To speed up the deployment, we recommend disabling minification and bundling, and
  only generating the admin theme for the locales it is used with.
- If you run the ece-tools, make sure you run the Hyva scripts first. Otherwise, the
  style is built after the static content is deployed, and you get no stylesheets.
- For Hyvä projects deployed with capistrano-magento2, if the production stylesheet
  is not kept in version control, there are a few additional steps required to generate
  it during deployment.
- To build the production stylesheet, you need to have node and npm installed on your
  server.
- Cookies are only saved when the visitor has given their consent.
- To force a cookie to be stored regardless of the visitor consenting to cookies,
  add the name to the window.cookie_consent_groups.necessary array.
- These interacting levels of caching often lead to interesting and hard to reproduce
  bugs.
- The core favors using the FPC cache.
- 'Hyvä releases have different minimum Node.js requirements due to dependencies:
  Hyvä 1.4.0 and newer: Node.js 18, Hyvä 1.3.6: Node.js 16, Hyvä 1.2.0: Node.js 14,
  Hyvä 1.1.0: Node.js 12.13'
- The `hyva-modules` plugin must be placed before the `postcss-import` and `tailwindcss/nesting`
  plugins.
- For Tailwind v4, CSS variables are supported by default.
- Hyvä versions 1.3.6 and newer integrate Browserlist to maintain browser compatibility
  based on the supported browsers list.
- If you don’t see changes when the browser reloads, check if caches are disabled,
  e.g. full_page, blocks_html, layout.
- If you have issues with caching during development, consider using Magento Cache
  Clean.
- This structure was originally chosen and over time the code developed and now no
  longer fits the folder names very well.
- The structure has not been changed for backward compatibility.
- But it might change in future to make the folder names better express their intended
  purpose.
- Themes up to Hyvä release 1.1.13 have to ensure all classes are found by including
  all relevant paths manually in the theme purge content configuration.
- Since release 1.1.14 of the hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module the file app/etc/hyva-themes.json
  is used to automatically include relevant modules in the purge content paths configuration.
- This approach is ideal for managing multiple child themes with slight variations
  across different websites.
- It promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance.
- Simplifies CSS management for Hyvä themes in Magento 2.
- Automatically merges CSS from Hyvä-compatible modules into your theme, eliminating
  manual imports.
- Powered by the CSS color-mix function, this method doesn't work on some older browsers.
- This is still a sample configuration of TailwindCSS and may change, so use at your
  own risk.
- Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed (check with `node -v`).
- While updating optional plugins, reviewing their changelogs before updating is recommended.
- Deprecated features are for older versions of Hyvä before version 1.4
- Modals are available since version 1.1.6 of Hyva_Theme.
- Most of the time you will be able to satisfy styling requirements by adding and
  removing classes to the modal.
- The modal will ignore subsequent calls to hide further modals until duration ms
  have passed since the previous time hide was called.
- Since release 1.1.18 modal dialogs can be opened by dispatching the event `hyva-modal-show`.
- Available since 1.1.13
- Available since Hyvä 1.2.4 and 1.1.24
- Customizing modal methods can be done for specific instances or all instances.
- Use x-spread and x-bind for compatibility with both Alpine.js v2 and v3
- Dialog content must be wrapped with an element using x-ref='dialog'
- The default confirmation modal template is Hyva_Theme::modal/confirmation.phtml.
- Hyvä only supports reCAPTCHA v3 invisible, v2 invisible, and v2 checkbox.
- Sections are rendered as cards in the Hyvä default theme Product Detail Page.
- The 'group="detailed_info"' attribute on the block is required.
- To hide the list of attributes, the product-info.phtml template has to be overridden
  in a custom theme and the appropriate HTML has to be removed.
- To hide the section, the block product.attributes has to be removed using Layout
  XML.
- The composable customer header menu is only available in the 1.3 Hyvä releases.
- Menu items are sorted in ascending order (larger numbers go towards the end of the
  menu).
- The Hyvä Snap Slider is an AlpineJS plugin that empowers you to create accessible
  and highly customizable CSS-driven sliders.
- This component prioritizes accessibility by automatically managing the inert attribute
  for off-screen slides and adding appropriate ARIA labels.
- To support both versions of Alpine.js, simply add both attributes.
- The property '$el' always referred to the component root DOM element in Alpine v2.
- In Alpine v2, initialization functions always needed to be called explicitly with
  'x-init'.
- To support both versions of Alpine in your component, simply use both modifiers
  '@click.away' and '@click.outside'.
- The theme file 'etc/hyva-libraries.json' specifies which version of a library to
  load.
- The x-defer attribute can be added to .phtml templates directly, or it can be injected
  into the page through JavaScript.
errors:
- Cache records can be deleted either by Cache ID or by Cache Tags.
- 'DEPRECATED_COMMAND: Command has been removed or is discouraged'
- The current Alpine.js version is 2.8.2, but version >= 3 is required by the following
  extensions.
