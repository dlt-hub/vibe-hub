auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.coinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/22055385723289-Introduction-to-CoinEx-Broker-Rules:
  - Authorization code flow OAuth2.0 is used for broker integration. After broker
    approval, you receive client_id and client_secret via email. Users authorize third-party
    applications, which exchange the authorization code for an access token to call
    CoinEx OpenAPI. The broker_id must be included in the client_id field for rebate
    order statistics.
  - Brokers authenticate API requests using user API keys paired with a unique Broker
    ID assigned during onboarding. When a broker sends orders to CoinEx via the API
    endpoints, the user's API key is included in the request along with the Broker
    ID to identify the broker and enable rebate tracking.
