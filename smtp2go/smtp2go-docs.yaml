auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.smtp2go.com/docs/getting-started:
  - Authentication uses an API Key sent as the 'api_key' parameter in the request
    body or query string. API Keys can be customized with specific permissions and
    IP restrictions through account settings.
  - 'The SMTP2GO API requires authentication using an API Key supplied in one of two
    ways: either as an "api_key" field in the JSON request body, or as an "X-Smtp2go-Api-Key"
    header in the request. An invalid or missing API Key will return a 401 Unauthorized
    status code.'
- information_source; https://developers.smtp2go.com/docs/send-an-email:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send your unique API key in the X-Smtp2go-Api-Key
    header with each request in the format X-Smtp2go-Api-Key: api-xxxx where xxxx
    is your actual API key.'
  - 'The API requires authentication via an API key that can be passed in two ways:
    as the X-Smtp2go-Api-Key header or as an api_key field in the JSON request body.
    The endpoint is https://api.smtp2go.com/v3/email/send and expects Content-Type
    application/json.'
- information_source; https://developers.smtp2go.com/reference/general-api-resources:
  - SMTP2GO uses API key authentication sent via the X-Smtp2go-Api-Key header. Include
    your API key in the X-Smtp2go-Api-Key request header with value YourAPIKeyHere.
    A 401 Unauthorized response indicates no valid API key was provided, and a 403
    Forbidden response indicates the API key lacks required permissions.
