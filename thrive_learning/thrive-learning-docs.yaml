notes:
- Thrive requires user data to be sent in a specific YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Robust API access for custom integrations and data exchange enabling seamless data
  flow and extending functionality
- Language settings significantly influence what content is visible in specific areas
  of Thrive.
- When a pathway that previously had no language set is updated to include a specific
  language, it may disappear from homepage blocks and the Explore page for some users.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Ensure that your user provisioning system is updated to handle the new domain field.
- This will require Thrive technical support to set up.
- If users are added via a data feed or CSV upload, manual edits may be overwritten
  the next time the feed runs.
- User data is synchronised automatically every six hours (starting at 12 am UTC)
  enabling timely updates to employee profiles.
- Runs four times daily to ensure timely updates across employee records and new hires.
