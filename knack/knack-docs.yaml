auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.knack.com/reference/retrieving-multiple-records:
  - API requests require three headers for authentication. Send X-Knack-Application-Id
    with your application ID, X-Knack-REST-API-Key with the value "knack", and Authorization
    with a valid user token. These credentials must be included in every request to
    the Knack API.
  - All API requests require the X-Knack-REST-API-Key header set to your API key value.
    Include this header in every request to authenticate with the Knack API.
  - The Knack API uses two required headers for authentication. Include X-Knack-Application-Id
    with your application ID and X-Knack-REST-API-Key with your API key in all requests
    to the API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.knack.com/reference/pagination:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page and rows_per_page.
    The page parameter (default 1) specifies which page to retrieve, and rows_per_page
    (default 25, maximum 1,000) specifies records per page. The response includes
    total_records to determine if additional pages exist. Stop paginating when retrieved
    records are less than rows_per_page or when page times rows_per_page exceeds total_records.
- information_source; https://docs.knack.com/reference/retrieving-multiple-records:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: include `page` query parameter (optional,
    defaults to 1) to request specific pages. Response includes `total_pages`, `current_page`,
    `total_records`, and `records` array; stop paginating when `current_page` equals
    `total_pages`.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit and offset (both optional). Responses include
    total_records, total_pages, and current_page fields. To paginate, construct subsequent
    requests using offset parameter; stop when current_page equals total_pages.
