auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/api/:
  - API key authentication is used for Sensu API requests. Set the `SENSU_API_KEY`
    environment variable with your API key value. API keys are cluster-wide resources
    that can be generated using sensuctl or the POST core/v2/apikeys endpoint, and
    they work independently of user passwords.
  - API requests require the `Authorization` header with the value `Key $SENSU_API_KEY`,
    where `$SENSU_API_KEY` is your Sensu API key. Pass this header with all requests
    to authenticate.
  - 'Bearer token authentication using access tokens retrieved from sensuctl config
    file, sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>". Access
    tokens expire after approximately 15 minutes and must be refreshed by running
    sensuctl commands. Alternatively, persistent API keys (UUIDs) can be used for
    authentication without token refresh requirements.'
  - Sensu API requires authentication for most endpoints using either a JSON Web Token
    (JWT) access token or an API key. The authentication environment variable is SENSU_API_KEY.
    Exceptions include the authentication, health, metrics, ready, and version endpoints
    which do not require auth.
  - Sensu API uses bearer token authentication with JWT tokens. Access tokens are
    sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" and expire after a set period.
    When a token expires (resulting in 401 Unauthorized), obtain a new one by POST
    to /auth/token with the expired access token in the Authorization header and the
    refresh_token in the JSON request body, which returns a new access_token, expires_at
    timestamp, and refresh_token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/api/:
  - Pagination uses a `limit` query parameter to specify the number of results per
    request and a `continue` query parameter to pass the continuation token. The response
    header includes a `Sensu-Continue` token for fetching the next page; when this
    header is absent, all results have been retrieved.
- information_source; https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/release-notes/:
  - The Sensu API supports pagination using the `limit` and `continue` query parameters.
    The `limit` parameter restricts the maximum number of objects returned per request,
    while the `continue` parameter is used to retrieve subsequent pages of results
    from large datasets.
