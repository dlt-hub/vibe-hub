auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.gravitee.io/am/reference/am-api-reference:
  - AM API uses token-based authorization. Send credentials via the Authorization
    header as "Bearer token" or as an "Authorization=Bearer token" cookie. Retrieve
    tokens from the token endpoint using Basic authentication with user credentials.
  - The AM Management API uses two authentication methods. First, Basic authentication
    with base64-encoded credentials (username:password) sent via the Authorization
    header to the /management/auth/token endpoint returns a bearer token. Second,
    the /management/auth/authorize endpoint with a redirect_uri query parameter initiates
    an OAuth-like flow that sets an HTTP cookie for authentication. The token response
    includes access_token, expires_at, and token_type bearer fields.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. After a successful POST request to the
    login endpoint (http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/auth/login), the server
    responds with a Set-Cookie header containing Authorization="Bearer token", which
    should be used in subsequent requests to authenticate API calls.
