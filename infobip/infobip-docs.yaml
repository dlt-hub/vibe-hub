  will always assign conversations to agents who are online and available (with capacity),

- It is strongly recommended that senders assign a separate subdomain of the main
  domain name for each distinct sending purpose.
- Using separate subdomains protects company mail from the mailing practices of customers.
- The recommendation is to dedicate a specific use case for each of your sending domains.
- By allocating specific subdomains for different email activities, you can effectively
  segment your email flows within your organization.
- A dedicated IP address can improve your deliverability rates tremendously if your
  email best practices are in place.
- You might even want more than one dedicated IP address to send specific types of
  email messages.
- Geolocated sender can be used for terminating messages only in North America.

- URLs in CTA buttons cannot be shortened if the template was not initially created
  for tracking

  key-value pairs differ for each product and may affect how the app connects with
  Infobip.

  key-value pairs.
