auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.docebo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020082040-API-general-information:
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token_value>" in all requests to the endpoint.'
  - 'The Docebo API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Bearer {token}" for all requests. Use HTTPS
    protocol to protect credentials during transmission.'
- information_source; https://help.docebo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020082060-APIs-authentication:
  - JWT Bearer authentication is required. Create a JWT token with claims iss (your_client_id),
    sub (docebo_username), aud (yoursubdomain.docebosaas.com), iat, and exp, sign
    it with your private key using RS256, then POST it to https://<yoursubdomain.docebosaas.com>/oauth2/token
    with grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer in the request body
    to obtain an access token.
  - OAuth 2.0 framework is used for authentication. Client applications request an
    access token from the LMS endpoint https://<yoursubdomain.docebosaas.com>/oauth2/token,
    then send the extracted token to each REST API. OAuth 2.0 app credentials (client
    ID and client secret) are obtained from the Docebo API and SSO App settings page.
    The scope parameter controls which resources and operations the access token permits,
    and token permissions depend on the user level used to obtain it.
  - OAuth2 Bearer token authentication. After obtaining an access token from the Token
    Endpoint, include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>" for
    all API calls. Tokens expire in 3600 seconds (1 hour) and can be refreshed using
    a refresh token; the refresh token must be securely stored and follows RFC6749
    guidelines.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.docebo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020082040-API-general-information:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page_size (1-200, required) and page (default
    1, optional) passed via query string. Setting get_cursor=1 returns _links object
    with self, next, and goto URLs for navigation; follow the next href to get subsequent
    pages or replace __page__ in goto href for direct page access.
