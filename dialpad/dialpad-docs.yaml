notes:
- OAuth2 authentication is required.
- Only Company Admins can create API keys on Dialpad.
- API keys are more powerful than passwords as they allow a consumer to perform actions
  across all users in the company.
- OAuth should be used by application developers who wish to build an integration
  to be used across multiple companies in Dialpad.
- We are currently testing our integration using the Dialpad CTI. While we are able
  to initiate and receive calls through the CTI interface, we are not receiving any
  webhook events on our configured endpoint.
- I have connected zapier and Dialpad. I am using the call state 'hangup' and 'transcription'
  in the zap.
- Dialpad suggests to use is_today when querying current day data and days_ago for
  historical data.
- '"hid" access will need to be added to your Dialpad iframe by end of Jan 2023.'
- The formatting for the payload properties is not currently standardized and may
  be subject to change.
- Subscriptions are limited to 100 per subscription type for all targets combined
  under a Dialpad Company.
- Subscriptions targeting the Company itself are limited to 10 per subscription type.
- Events are sent in the JWT format and signed with a secret.
- Call routers can be assigned multiple numbers.
- Call routers can be configured to send JWT payloads for additional security.
- The launch URL can be used to invoke the Dialpad desktop application.
- Payloads sent to your webhook will contain fields related to agent status changes.
- The websocket connection will be disconnected after 1 hour to ensure connections
  remain secure.
- WSS is recommended for security.
- Requires setup of connected app in Dialpad
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- This is an Early Access Program feature. Please contact your Customer Success Manager
  to request access.
- Payloads sent to your webhook will be either JWT encoded or JSON encoded.
- Requires OAuth2 setup for access tokens.
- Events are generated for various call states.
- Bearer token is the recommended approach for authentication.
- Table last updated March 7th, 2023.
- By default, SMS text content is not included in events to ensure data privacy.
- If you are using API keys, please create a new key and add the 'message_content_export'
  when a target is specified with an event subscription, otherwise 'message_content_export:all'
  scope is required to enable this.
- For OAuth apps, contact [email protected] and request the `message_content_export,
  message_content_export:all` OAuth scopes.
- Events are sent to a webhook that you provide.
- Payloads sent to your webhook will be JWT encoded.
errors:
- '400 Bad Request: The request could not be processed by the server due to malformed
  syntax, for example, missing required parameters.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Authentication information is missing or invalid.'
- '403 Forbidden: The request contained valid authentication data and was understood
  by the server, but the server is refusing action.'
- '404 Not Found: The server has not found anything matching the request.'
- '409 Conflict: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
  state of the resource.'
- '413 Request Entity Too Large: The server is refusing to process a request because
  the request entity is larger than the what server is willing or able to process.'
- '429 Too Many Requests: The client has sent too many requests in a given amount
  of time.'
- '503 Service Unavailable: The server cannot handle the request due to an internal
  server error or service is overloaded.'
- If the endpoint takes more than 5 seconds to respond or if there are more than 10
  failures in an hour, the call router will be automatically disabled.
- '401 Unauthorized: Check token validity.'
- '404 Not Found: Verify endpoint and parameters.'
