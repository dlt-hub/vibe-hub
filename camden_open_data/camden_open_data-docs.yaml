pagination_info:

  - The Explore API uses limit-based pagination via a query parameter. The limit parameter
    controls how many records are returned per request (example shows limit=2). The
    response includes a total_count field indicating the total number of available
    records (with a maximum of 20000 groups when using group_by). However, the documentation
    does not specify how to request subsequent pages or construct pagination requests
    beyond the initial limit parameter.
