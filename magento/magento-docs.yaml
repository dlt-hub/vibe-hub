      to /rest/V1/tfa/provider/google/authenticate with Content-Type: application/json
      header and a JSON body containing username, password, and otp (six-digit code

      header as Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>. Admin tokens are valid for 4
      hours by default and can be configured under Stores > Settings > Configuration

  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in Magento requires a six-digit code from an authenticator
    app (such as Google Authenticator) in addition to username and password credentials.
    To generate an admin API token with 2FA enabled, send a POST request to `/rest/V1/tfa/provider/google/authenticate`
    with username, password, and the current six-digit authenticator code. The QR
    code provided during 2FA setup must be scanned into the authenticator app to enable
    code generation for login and token requests.
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is required for admin token generation. POST to
    `<BASE_URL>/rest/V1/tfa/provider/google/authenticate` with JSON body containing
    username, password, and otp (six-digit code from authenticator app). The response
    includes an access_token that must be sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    <ACCESS_TOKEN>" for subsequent API requests.
