auth_info:
- information_source; https://spacetraders.io/api-guide/authorization:
  - The SpaceTraders API requires JWT bearer token authentication. Obtain a token
    by registering as a new agent, then include it in the Authorization header of
    every request with the format "Bearer <token>". The API returns a 400 Unauthorized
    error if the token is missing or invalid.
- information_source; https://spacetraders.io/game-concepts/agents-and-factions:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer AGENT_TOKEN" or "Bearer ACCOUNT_TOKEN" depending on the endpoint
    being called.
  - The API token generated when you register is scoped to your agent and required
    for all endpoints under the /my namespace. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as a bearer token to access agent-specific data and control your fleet.
- information_source; https://spacetraders.io/quickstart/new-game:
  - To register an agent via API, you must first obtain an account token from the
    dashboard Settings menu using the "Generate Account Token" button. Send a POST
    request to https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/register with the Authorization header
    set to "Bearer ACCOUNT_TOKEN" and include symbol and faction in the JSON body.
    The response includes an agent token (AGENT_TOKEN) which is then used for all
    subsequent API requests by setting the Authorization header to "Bearer AGENT_TOKEN".
