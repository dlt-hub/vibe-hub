auth_info:
- information_source; https://sangomakb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PG/pages/29491369:
  - API Token authentication is required and must be passed in the HTTP header named
    "Token" with the token value. The token is obtained from the CRM API Settings
    page and included in request headers for all API calls.
  - Token-based authentication is required for all Sangoma CRM REST API requests.
    Send the token in requests to the same port configured for the Web GUI Admin;
    no separate authorization API is implemented.

  - 'Pagination uses optional path parameters: limit (number of results per page)
    and offset (starting position). These are appended to the endpoint path as [/:limit][/:offset].
    The since parameter filters results by timestamp. No response fields or stopping
    conditions are documented.'
  - 'The GET /admin/api/sangomacrm/rest/calls/list endpoints support offset-based
    pagination with optional path parameters: limit (default 999, number of records
    to return) and offset (starting record position). The since parameter filters
    calls after a unix timestamp in UTC and is optional unless setting limit or offset.'
