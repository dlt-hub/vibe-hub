notes:
- Join the conversation shaping the future of connected enterprise architectures at
  the Platform Summit 2025, Nordic APIs’ flagship conference.
- Event takes place on October 14 & 15.
- Separate registration required for the API Security UnConference on October 13.
- Community-led discussions on today’s most pressing API security topics
- An unconference has no fixed agenda — just spontaneous group discussions, presentations,
  and knowledge sharing.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Attendees are required to accept the Code of Conduct when registering for the conference.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Provision of a visa letter by Nordic APIs does not guarantee visa approval, which
  is made at the sole discretion of the government of the event’s host country.
- Visa letter requests should be made no later than 90 days prior to an event.
- You must be registered and paid in full for the event before requesting a visa letter.
- The API-driven identity management solution ensures scalable and secure user access
  to apps and websites, API access management.
- Kong helps organizations globally — from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises — unleash
  developer productivity, build securely and accelerate time to market.
- Requires OAuth2 setup with a connected app.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Google Maps API has a free tier but charges for higher usage.
- The API is free, provided you don’t go over your quota.
- Requires authentication
- Preventing unauthorized API access is important due to increased attack attempts.
- Authentication and authorization are essential for API security.
- Rate limiting and throttling can help prevent abuse.
- Input validation is crucial to avoid exploitation of endpoints.
- Encrypt API traffic with TLS to protect sensitive data.
- API gateways provide fine-grained access control and monitoring.
- Scoped tokens help limit access to specific resources.
- Restricting access by IP or location can enhance security.
- Web Application Firewalls can filter out common attacks.
- Token expiration and rotation can mitigate unauthorized access risks.
- An extremely important aspect of API design is security, so second to design style,
  it should be one of the top themes in a style guide.
- Much of an error code structure is stylistic.
- The balance then is one of usability and brevity.
- Error codes are useful diagnostic elements in the API space.
- Good error codes must include an HTTP Status Code, an Internal Reference ID, and
  Human readable messages.
- Scalable APIs are built from consistency.
- API-as-a-Product is a type of Software-as-a-Service that monetizes niche functionality.
- SSE is unidirectional data communication.
- Handles authentication using header forwarding.
- Zapier recommends a 201 code for successful subscriptions and a 409 code for non-unique
  subscription URLs.
- REST Hooks allow for subscription to changes without constant polling.
- A target URL is required for setting up hooks.
- Uses OAuth2 without a callback URL for Imgur API.

- API abuse has become one of the most prevalent cyberattacks with a broad target
  range.
- Organizations must patch API security holes to ensure robust cybersecurity.
- OAuth should be used to protect this API.
- APIs are often the weakest link when it comes to cybersecurity.
- API tokens are one of the most popular methods that API developers are adopting
  to ensure their API assets are as secure as possible.
- OAuth 2.0 was created to remedy some of the shortcomings of OAuth 1.0.
- Rate limits may apply to API usage
- Data accuracy can vary by region
- The ID of the rocket.
- GET and HEAD are safe methods that do not alter the resource.
- Use REST if you’re focused on wide scale API adoption or if your API is targeted
  at mobile apps.
- gRPC supports a wide array of authentication solutions
- High impact blog posts on API business models and tech advice.
- SOAP uses XML-based messaging.
- Orbit API is designed for community engagement and remote collaboration.
- API vulnerability scanners are essential tools for ensuring the security of your
  APIs.
- Endpoints require an authentication token
- Users must ensure to use the appropriate region for the API
- Open Up Your Data. Be a Digital Disruptor. Repurpose Existing Data with APIs to
  Drive Digital Innovation.
- API documentation needs to provide rich context for AI agents to understand requests.
- Thoroughly document API mechanics to reduce the potential for hallucination.
- Centralizes security by handling authentication and authorization for all AI model
  access
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of connected app in API
- Maintaining consistent product information, inventory levels, and customer data
  across all APIs is essential.
- The expanded attack surface necessitates strong security measures like API authentication
  and management protocols to protect sensitive data.
- Slow integrations lead to sluggish user experiences.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Merge
- Some objects may have rate limits on data fetching
- Requires setup of connected app in Merge
- An internal developer platform (IDP) is a strategic asset for organizations that
  rely on APIs to build products, integrate systems, or power external ecosystems.
- Webhooks are ubiquitous — 85% of the top 100 API companies have implemented webhooks.
- API governance is an essential component of API-first design.
- Proper API governance helps ensure consistency, security, communication, and cooperation
  between teams.
- Create a ToDo API using Flask and Flask-restful
- oasdiff can be run as either a Golang package or a command-line utility.
- oasdiff analyzes everything from endpoints to request/response parameters for updates
  and revisions.
- API key is sensitive information and should be kept secure.
- Accurately capturing API details is essential to maintain a well-structured API
  catalog.
- Organizing your APIs into groups is a great way to simplify their use.
