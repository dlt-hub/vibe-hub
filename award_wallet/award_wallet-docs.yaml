auth_info:
- information_source; https://awardwallet.com/api/account:
  - The authentication uses URL query parameters in a browser redirect flow. After
    a user approves a connection, a code parameter is sent to your endpoint via browser
    redirect, which must then be exchanged via GET request to the get-connection-info
    endpoint with the code as a path parameter. The code is valid for only 1 minute
    for security reasons.

  - Google OAuth2 authentication is required. Send a POST request with email, accessToken
    (OAuth2 access token from Google), and refreshToken (OAuth2 refresh token) in
    the JSON body to connect a Gmail account.
  - Google OAuth2 authentication is used to connect Google mailboxes. End users authorize
    access via Google's consent screen. Optionally, you can provide your own `googleClientId`,
    `googleClientSecret`, and `googlePubSubTopic` obtained from Google Cloud Console
    to replace the default AwardWallet credentials; contact support to update your
    account with these values.
  - OAuth2 flow with Yahoo. Request `Mail - Read` and `Profiles - Read Public Extended`
    permissions. Supply accessToken and refreshToken in the JSON request body along
    with email, startFrom, callbackUrl, and optional userData and tags parameters.
  - OAuth2 is required. You must obtain approval from Verizon Media Mail API (mail-api
    @ verizonmedia.com), then create an app under your Yahoo! developer account at
    https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/. Use the /mailboxes/start-auth method with redirect
    URI https://awardwallet.com/mailboxes/callback/oauth/aol and request email and
    mail-r permissions. In requests, provide accessToken and refreshToken fields in
    the JSON body, along with email address.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://awardwallet.com/api/email:
  - Use nextPageToken from the response as a query parameter in the next request to
    retrieve subsequent pages. Stop paginating when nextPageToken is not returned.
  - Use the `pageToken` query parameter (optional on first call, required for subsequent
    calls) to paginate through mailbox results. The response includes a `nextPageToken`
    field; pass this value as `pageToken` in the next request to fetch the next page.
    Stop paginating when `nextPageToken` is not returned in the response.
  - Use the scroll endpoint with cursor-based pagination. Include optional tags query
    parameter to filter by tags (comma-separated). The response returns mailbox items;
    use the scroll mechanism to retrieve subsequent pages when dealing with large
    result sets.
  - Use the scroll method to fetch larger datasets beyond the 500 record limit per
    request. The documentation mentions this pagination approach but does not specify
    the exact scroll parameter names, request structure, or response fields needed
    to implement scrolling.
