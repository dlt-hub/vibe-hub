auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/updated-esi-quick-reference-for-new-developers:
  - ESI authenticated routes are accessed through EVE's SSO (single sign on). For
    authenticated calls, follow the step-by-step process documented in the SSO to
    authenticated calls blog. The ESI Swagger UI at https://esi.evetech.net/ shows
    all available routes and their authentication requirements.
- information_source; https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/overview/:
  - ESI requires authentication via SSO (Single Sign-On) for many endpoints. Authentication
    is handled through the SSO service, with specific scopes required per endpoint
    as indicated in the API Explorer. Some endpoints are public and do not require
    authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/esi-concurrent-programming-and-pagination:
  - The get_characters_character_id_killmails_recent endpoint uses max_kill_id and
    max_count query parameters to limit returned data. The get_wars endpoint uses
    max_war_id query parameter, and get_corporations_corporation_id_killmails_recent
    uses max_kill_id query parameter to control data returned, operating as cursor-like
    pagination mechanisms rather than traditional offset/limit pagination.
