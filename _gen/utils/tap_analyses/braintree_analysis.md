### Explanation:

1. **Base URL and Authentication**: The base URL is assumed to be the Braintree API's main endpoint. Authentication is done using basic authentication with `merchant_id`, `public_key`, and `private_key` as credentials.

2. **Endpoints**: The `transactions` endpoint is configured to use the `search` path with a GET method. The parameters include a date range for `created_at`, which is used for incremental loading.

3. **Pagination**: The code suggests handling data in single-page increments due to potential internal limits on the number of records returned by the Braintree API.

4. **Data Selection and Incremental Loading**: The data is selected from the `transactions` array, and incremental loading is managed using the `updated_at` field. The `created_at` parameter is used to specify the date range for data retrieval.

5. **Primary Key**: The primary key for transactions is `id`.

6. **Gotchas**: Special considerations include handling non-monotonic `updated_at` values and ensuring correct handling of `disbursement_date` for incremental loading.

7. **Dependencies**: No explicit dependencies between endpoints are identified in the provided code.
