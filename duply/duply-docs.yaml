auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.duply.co/docs:
  - API key and secret key must be combined and sent as Basic Authorization in the
    Authorization header. The documentation references an authentication section for
    details on how to combine these credentials.
  - 'Basic Authentication is required for API access. Include an Authorization header
    with your API key and secret key combined as Basic Authorization (format: base64-encoded
    "apikey:secretkey").'
  - 'Duply uses Basic Authentication for API requests. You must send an Authorization
    header containing the word Basic followed by a space and a base64-encoded string
    in the format apiKey:secretKey. For example, if your API key is "apiKey" and secret
    key is "secretKey", encode "apiKey:secretKey" to base64 and send it as Authorization:
    Basic <base64-encoded-string>. The Authorization header is required for all API
    endpoints.'
  - Your API key and secret key must be combined and sent as Basic Authorization in
    the Authorization header for both GET and POST requests. The header name is "Authorization"
    and it requires Basic auth format (base64-encoded "api_key:secret_key").
