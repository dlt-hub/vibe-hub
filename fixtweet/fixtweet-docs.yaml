notes:
- We don’t set strict limits on how many times you can call the API.
- If you have persistent high usage of the API we may restrict you from using it.
- This API was just added. While it is mostly stable, it may be subject to change
  without notice
- We rely on Twitter’s guest token API in order to fetch Tweets.
- This approach has a number of benefits. We have practically no rate limits (when
  not using elongator) as tokens can be regenerated if a rate limit is hit on a particular
  edge.
- In 2023, Twitter started blocking tweets with NSFW media from the guest API.
- To overcome this, FixTweet uses a service binding called elongator, which utilizes
  empty Twitter accounts to successfully make these requests.
