auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.observeinc.com/eng:
  - API tokens are used for authentication. Create tokens via POST /v1/service-accounts/{accountId}/api-tokens
    endpoint, then include the token in requests. Tokens are managed through service
    accounts and can be created, retrieved, patched, and deleted via dedicated API
    endpoints.
  - Requests to the Observe API are authenticated using HTTP Bearer authentication.
    Supply the API token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <customerid>
    <token>".
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN" in all requests. API tokens are managed through
    login endpoints and documented in the API authentication reference.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.observeinc.com/eng:
  - Pagination uses query parameters cursorId (required, string), offset (optional,
    int64), and numRows (optional, int64) to fetch pages. Response headers include
    X-Observe-Total-Rows for total row count and X-Observe-Next-Page containing the
    URL for the next page; use X-Observe-Cursor-Id with offset and numRows to construct
    custom pagination requests.
  - Set paginate to true as a query parameter for asynchronous paginated mode, which
    returns 202 Accepted with headers for fetching results via /v1/meta/export/query/page.
    Use rowCount in the request body to specify maximum rows returned, defaulting
    to 100,000 (max without pagination) or up to int64 maximum with pagination enabled.
  - Use the paginate parameter set to true in the request body to enable pagination.
    Response includes a next_page_token field; use this token in subsequent requests
    to retrieve the next page of results.
