auth_info:
- information_source; https://arafat2.me/api-docs/:
  - Authentication is required for the job applications endpoint using a Bearer token
    passed in the Authorization header. The token should be formatted as "Bearer <token>"
    where <token> is the actual authentication token value. The POST endpoint for
    AI-powered resume generation has model-dependent authentication, meaning auth
    requirements vary based on which model is selected.
  - Bearer token authentication is required for all resume endpoints. Send the JWT
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>". The token is obtained during
    user login and grants access only to the authenticated user's own resume data.
  - JWT (Simple JWT) is used for stateless token-based authentication. Credentials
    are sent as Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Required environment variables
    include SECRET_KEY for Django configuration and database credentials (DB_NAME,
    DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT) for PostgreSQL access.
  - JWT Authentication is used. Register via `/api/auth/register/` to create an account,
    then login via `/api/auth/token/` to obtain JWT tokens for authenticated access
    to the API.
  - JWT Bearer token authentication. Obtain access and refresh tokens via POST /api/auth/token/
    with username and password. Include the access token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <access-token>" for authenticated requests. Refresh expired tokens
    using POST /api/auth/token/refresh/ with the refresh token in the request body.
