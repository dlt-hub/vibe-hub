  - 'ACCESS_TOKEN must be passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Send
    requests to the Flexpa FHIR API with the header Authorization: Bearer flexpa-link-access-token,
    where the token value is obtained from the Flexpa Link flow.'
  - 'API calls to Flexpa''s FHIR endpoints require a bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header. The access token is obtained through Flexpa Link and should be sent as
    Authorization: Bearer flexpa-link-access-token in requests to https://api.flexpa.com/fhir
    endpoints.'
  - API keys must be base64 encoded and passed in the Authorization header for authentication.
    The endpoint supports refresh token grant flow with grant_type=refresh_token.
    Client credentials are required and invalid_client errors indicate incorrect API
    keys. The refresh token parameter is passed in the request and invalid_grant errors
    indicate an expired or incorrect refresh token.
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in
    the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`, where ACCESS_TOKEN
    is a flexpa-link-access-token value.'
  - 'Access to the Provider Directory requires an Application Access Token obtained
    through the Token Endpoint. Authentication uses an Authorization: Bearer header
    with the Application Access Token. Additionally, the _project parameter with static
    value 01956cb0-e18e-747a-8dba-265e83e1ade2 must be included in requests to search
    the provider directory.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.flexpa.com/docs/records:
  - Pagination uses query parameters _count (page size) and _offset (starting position).
    The response includes a link array with objects containing relation and url fields;
    use the url from the object with relation "next" to fetch the next page, "previous"
    for the prior page, or "first" for the initial page.
  - The `_count` parameter limits the number of results per page. Use `_total` query
    parameter with values none, accurate, or estimate to control total count behavior
    in responses. Refer to the Pagination documentation for complete pagination details.
