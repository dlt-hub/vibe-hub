auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/developers-guide/restapi:
  - REST API authentication uses query parameters to provide credentials and obtain
    a session token. Send an authenticate request with ignite.login=[user] and ignite.password=[password]
    query parameters to the /ignite endpoint with cmd=authenticate, or include these
    parameters with any REST command. The API returns a sessionToken in the JSON response
    that can be used for subsequent requests within that session. Authentication is
    per-node, so credentials must be obtained separately for each node in a cluster.
- information_source; https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain9/latest/developers-guide/rest/security:
  - Basic Authentication and Bearer token authentication are supported. Basic Authentication
    requires a Base64-encoded username:password string sent in the Authorization header
    on each request. Bearer token authentication uses OAuth 2.0-style token issuance;
    tokens are sent in the Authorization header. Both methods require authentication
    to be enabled in cluster configuration.
  - JWT Bearer token authentication. Obtain a token by POST to /management/v1/authentication/login
    with username and password in JSON body. Include the returned JWT token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for all subsequent requests. Tokens expire
    per cluster security config and can be revoked via DELETE endpoints /management/v1/authentication/jwt
    or /management/v1/authentication/jwt/{token}, requiring REVOKE_TOKEN permission.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. Basic Authentication requires sending
    a Base64-encoded string of username:password in the Authorization header on each
    request. JWT Bearer Authentication (recommended for production) requires first
    obtaining a token by POSTing username and password as JSON to the /management/v1/authentication/login
    endpoint, then using that token in subsequent requests. For Basic auth, send "Authorization:
    Basic <base64(username:password)>" header. For JWT, send "Authorization: Bearer
    <token>" header after retrieving the token from the login endpoint.'

  - Authenticate using HTTP Basic Auth with your Nebula credentials (email as username
    and password). Send the credentials in the Authorization header using the format
    username:password encoded in base64, or use the -u flag in curl.
