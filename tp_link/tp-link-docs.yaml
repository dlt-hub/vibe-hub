notes:
- Requires OAuth2 authentication to access user data
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Data is stored as TSV rows containing activity name, note, latitude, longitude,
  and start time.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Various restaurants listed for different cities.
- Instructions on disabling contactless payment on a credit card.
- This process takes an hour or two and costs around $10/year.
- Some applications require specific permissions for full functionality.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Must run as root to execute commands.
- Tested on Arch Linux.
- Ensure that we're not already connected
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in syncthing
- Some objects like Sync Status may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Note that in this example, the Bash variable response is interpolated into a raw,
  triple-quoted Python string as r'''${response}''' in order to avoid possible issues
  caused by unescaped characters.
- Requires setup of Openswan and xl2tpd packages.
- Waiting for ppp device...
- Use NamedModulesPlugin instead of OccurrenceOrderPlugin, and add 'manifest' as a
  CommonsChunkPlugin name.
- Chronofile's interface has barely ever changed.
- Adding a new entry takes so little time.
- Uses NamedModulesPlugin instead of OccurrenceOrderPlugin, and add 'manifest' as
  a CommonsChunkPlugin name.
- The app saves each log entry as a TSV row containing the activity’s name, descriptive
  note (optional), latitude, longitude, and start time in seconds since 1970.
- Substitute your login details with cloudUserName and cloudPassword.
- Ensure that required packages are installed.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Syncthing
- File deletion propagates to all devices and is irreversible by default unless a
  trash can folder is used.
- Requires shared secret (pre-shared key) authentication.
- Ensure that we're already connected
- This is all a bit of legwork but definitely worth the peace of mind.
- Elixir has native support for chaining functions.
- The guitalele is a miniature guitar built like a ukulele.
- It is fun, versatile, portable, cheap, and easy to learn.
- Uses NamedModulesPlugin instead of OccurrenceOrderPlugin
- Add 'manifest' as a CommonsChunkPlugin name
- The Duolingo team constantly fine-tunes their algorithms.
