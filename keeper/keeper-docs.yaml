notes:
- To allow Offline Access, re-authenticate to Keeper after selecting the duration.
- Keeper limits the number of users to 5000 for performance reasons.
- A Compliance Report is limited to 1000 records.
- 'Keeper Security is the most certified solution in the industry: SOC 2 Certified,
  ISO 27001 and ISO 27017 Certified, FIPS 140-3 Validated, GDPR Compliant, GSA Certified,
  SAM Certified, Compliant with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension
  to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.'
- Keeper offers both on-premise and cloud versions of Keeper SSO Connect™.
- Cloud component of the Keeper architecture is hosted with Amazon AWS.
- Admins can create custom types that fit the needs of your organization.
- Admin role with 'Manage Record Types in Vault' permission is required to create
  new custom Record Types.
- Roles allow you to define enforcement policies based on a user's job responsibility.
- Nodes are used to organize your users into distinct groupings.
- Only approved devices are able to attempt login.
- 2FA is prompted before Master Password entry.
- Keeper SSO Connect supports real-time authentication and provisioning.
- SCIM provisioning can provision, de-provision, and assign users to teams.
- 2FA is always enabled on the Keeper servers.
- Offline authentication and vault access is permitted by all consumer customers.
- Keeper integrates with any SAML 2.0 compatible identity provider such as Okta, Microsoft
  Azure, Google Workspace, Centrify, OneLogin, Ping Identity, JumpCloud and more.
- We recommend SSO Connect Cloud for most customers.
- The Account Transfer policy provides business and enterprise customers with the
  ability to transfer a user's vault if they are terminated or abruptly leave the
  organization.
- By default the Account Transfer role policy is on for the All Users role, and the
  Transfer Account administrative permission is enabled for the Keeper Administrator
  role.
- Account Transfer functionality must be enabled and the user must login to their
  vault (and accept the account sharing consent) prior to performing a transfer by
  an Administrator.
- Files can be securely shared either directly to other Keeper users, or within a
  Shared Folder.
- Files can be attached and viewed from the Keeper iOS and Android applications.

  of some record types.
- Custom types can be created for all users, or users within specific roles.
- Two-Factor Authentication can be enforced through Keeper's Role-based Enforcement
  Policies
- Keeper supports popular methods of 2FA including SMS/Text Message, TOTP generator
  apps, Duo Security, RSA SecurID, Keeper DNA, FIDO2 WebAuthn
- Node Isolation affects the ability for users to share records and folders outside
  of their node tree.
- 2FA will be bypassed when accessing your vault in Offline Mode.
- In order to have a local repository to access offline, the vault needs to have been
  authenticated and synchronized online first at least once.
- Time-Limited Access allows you to securely share credentials or secrets with other
  Keeper users on a temporary basis, automatically revoking access at a specified
  time.
- Time-Limited Access prevents long standing privileges and ensures that information
  is removed from the recipient’s vault, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access.
- Roles and Teams are separate but related concepts.
- Role-based Access Controls (RBAC) provide the organization the ability to define
  enforcements based on a user's job responsibility.
- Teams can be configured with several restrictions that will override any folder-level
  permission settings.
- Forcefield is embedded in the Keeper Desktop application available from the Keeper
  Security website.
- This vault is intended for personal use only. All business-related credentials must
  be stored within your company issued vault.

- US GovCloud (FedRAMP Compliant) region is available on request.
- To ensure a seamless transition when updating user email addresses in bulk, Keeper
  recommends using Keeper Commander (CLI Tool) before making changes in the IdP.
- This command updates the primary email while retaining the old email as an alias.
- Users can manually update their Keeper email, but this must be coordinated to avoid
  authentication issues.
- BreachWatch events are managed by the Role policy.
- BreachWatch events must be configured to flow through the Advanced Reporting & Alerts
  module.
- For enhanced security, if you have deployed a firewall or zero trust network which
  restricts end-user network traffic to specific services, you can add Keeper to your
  AllowList based on FQDN.
- If you're using a Security Key with your LastPass account, switch to TOTP or some
  other MFA method first.
- Keeper is a zero-knowledge platform and we cannot assist in the recovery process.
- By default, users are logged out of Keeper if their browser window closes, or if
  their computer restarts.
- Keeper recommends that you also set the 'Inactivity Logout Timer' which automatically
  logs you out of Keeper after a period of inactivity.
- Keeper is GDPR compliant and we are committed to ensuring our business processes
  and products continue to maintain compliance for our customers in the European Union.
- Keeper's desktop applications, web applications and mobile applications do not contain
  any trackers or 3rd party libraries which perform tracking.
- Keeper is a Zero-Knowledge platform.
- Keeper supports a number of two-factor authentication methods including FIDO2 WebAuthn
  devices, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator and SMS.

  upgrade to KeeperChat Plus.
- You can designate up to five emergency contacts
- The amount of time for access can be set up to three months per contact
- Keeper is Zero Knowledge and cannot decrypt customer data.
- Account recovery can be disabled by the customer in the role policy section of the
  Admin Console.
- KeeperFill for Apps is a useful tool built into the Keeper Desktop application for
  Mac and PC that lives in the system tray/menu bar of your computer and gives you
  quick and easy access to your vault using a simple hotkey.
- Users who login with Keeper SSO Connect integration don’t require a master password,
  since the encryption keys are managed by the Enterprise.
- Keeper utilizes best-in-class security with a zero-trust framework and zero-knowledge
  security architecture to safeguard your infrastructure and mitigate the risk of
  a data breach.
- Once ready to deploy Keeper Connection Manager to production, it is critically important
  that customers configure SSL encryption.
- For optimal accuracy when using Keeper for Passkeys, make sure to tap iCloud Passwords
  & Keychain to remove it as an option.

- 'Realtime system status is available at: https://statuspage.keeper.io/'
- Passkeys are available on Android 14+ and iOS 17+
- Successfully deploying Privileged Elevation and Delegation Management (PEDM) requires
  a phased approach that balances security with operational continuity.
- Take time to understand usage patterns before enforcing policies.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security when logging
  into your Keeper Vault or another site or application by requiring a secondary passcode
  upon logging in.
- Enabling Two-Factor Authentication is advised for highly valuable or sensitive accounts
  (e.g. banking, medical and social media accounts).
- Keeper's Vulnerability Disclosure Policy sets out expectations when working with
  researchers.
- To encourage good-faith security testing and disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities,
  we ask that you avoid violating privacy, harming user experience, disrupting production
  or corporate systems, and/or destroying data.
- BreachWatch performs unlimited security scans of your passwords on all devices.
- Users are automatically alerted to take action if any of the passwords in their
  vault have been used in a publicly known breach.
- If Keeper Connection Manager is hanging during startup, check if the Linux machine
  can generate enough entropy for random number generation.
- When using PostgreSQL, ensure that you have run the initialization scripts prior
  to granting the required database permissions.
- The 'groups' object refers to User Groups
- The 'group' object refers to the Connection Group location
- When importing this into another KCM instance, the connections will only import
  successfully if the Connection Group exists in the target
- Zero knowledge is preserved because the Keeper cloud is unable to decrypt the user's
  Data Key on their device.
- Keeper Connection Manager requires an SSL certificate for installation.
- Decide before starting installation if you want to use Let'sEncrypt, or if you have
  your own certificate file and private key.
- Guacamole and Glyptodon Enterprise do not impose reach or strength requirements.
- The text within Guacamole and Glyptodon Enterprise contains technical jargon that
  is not defined and does not link to corresponding definitions.
- Recent versions of Windows require NLA (Network Level Authentication) by default
  for RDP connections.
- Older versions of Windows may not support NLA or TLS by default.
- The Windows firewall may be configured to block inbound RDP connections.
- The Windows server does not need to be publicly accessible.
- Major updates of Keeper Connection Manager release once per year.
- Each major release may break compatibility with previous versions.
- Multiple KCM servers handle traffic simultaneously.
- Requires a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) to ensure users
  stay connected to the same KCM instance.
- One primary KCM server is active, with a standby instance ready to take over.
- Failover occurs only if the active server becomes unavailable.
- Session recordings in KCM are stored on the local disk of the KCM instance.
- If storage is full, new recordings fail while old ones remain.
- In a cluster, you may need to consider a shared drive or a cron job to sync the
  files.
- The KCM docker compose is configured with NGINX to terminate SSL with either a custom
  certificate or Let's Encrypt certificate.
- Ensure testing is performed in a non-production environment
- When prompted for a password during Docker login, enter the personal access token
  instead
- Use OpenSSL version 1.1.1 for compatibility with Java 11.
- The generated key password should not contain special characters.
- Users can connect seamlessly without requiring additional software on their devices.
- Device is shielded from data exfiltration, malicious sites, and potential manipulation.
- Ensure that the IP/Name and Port are accessible. If the service is active, you will
  get a JSON response.
- No authentication is required to access the documentation and there are no time
  limits.
- The server or virtual machine running the SSO Connect service must be strictly protected
  from unauthorized local access.
- Ensure that only trusted administrators have access to the system running SSO Connect,
  and follow best practices for server hardening and access control.
- It is critical to ensure that your IdP SAML Signing Certificates are renewed and
  activated. Typically, this occurs once per year.
- If you receive the error when logging into the Keeper vault, this usually indicates
  that the SAML Signing Certificate has expired.
- We recommend scheduling and planning migration with a Keeper support engineer before
  you start the process.
- DO NOT DELETE your existing On-Prem SSO instance until after 100% of users have
  migrated.
- DO NOT DELETE the On-Prem Keeper application from your identity provider until after
  100% of users have migrated.
- Users who are provisioned through SCIM can simply type in their Email Address on
  the Vault Login screen and they will be automatically directed to the IdP login
  screen to complete the sign-in.
- Please makes sure that your email domain is reserved with Keeper so that we route
  your users to the IdP.
- If using the email address is not desired, users can also click on 'Enterprise SSO
  Login' using the 'Enterprise Domain' that you configured in the Admin Console for
  the SSO connection.
- Please don't use SSO with your Keeper Administrator account for testing.
- Just-In-Time Provisioning is enabled by default.
- Ensure identity provider attribute mappings match Keeper's expected field names
  exactly.
- Amazon currently allows only CloudHsmV2 for new HSM deployments; Keeper supports
  this version.
- Legacy Cloud HSM v1 hardware is not supported by Keeper.
- Different customers may have different desired behavior when a user clicks on 'Logout'
  from their Keeper vault.
- If your identity provider has a 'Single Logout' option, then you can turn this feature
  ON from the identity provider configuration screen.
- Keeperはゼロ知識を活用したプラットフォームです。
- 暗号化キーはユーザーによって管理されているため、Keeper Securityの従業員がユーザーのデータを復号化することはできません。
- One time tokens can be used only once - afterwards use the generated config file
- A Keeper Bridge service account is required in order to authenticate against the
  Keeper Cloud.
- The account must have administrative access to the Bridge node and at least the
  permissions to manage nodes, users, roles, teams and Bridge/SSO objects.
- Make sure to enable 'Cascade Node Permissions'.
- Keeperはユーザーの生体認証データの保管や処理は行いません。
- FedRAMPおよびStateRAMP認証済みソリューション
- It is recommended that you take a snapshot / back up your server in case you need
  to revert.
- Reboot is required after Java installation
- It is recommended to reboot the server after the installation.
- Default filters are provided which are expected to work for most organizations.
- If an Organizational Unit is not mapped as a Node, all objects in that OU path will
  not be exported even if the Filter for the object type maps the object.
- Share Admins can manage shared folders and records, including changing permissions
  and ownership.
- One-Time Share is disabled on all default role policies for existing Enterprise
  customers.
- For all new role policies created after the launch of the One-Time Share feature,
  it is enabled by default.
- The default publish interval is set to 60 minutes.
- Delete Override is disabled by default.
- Admin Security Group is set to 'Keeper Admins' by default.
- Email Property is set to 'userPrincipalName' by default.
- Keeper is compatible with all SAML 2.0 SSO identity providers.
- The Gemalto HSM must be running Luna firmware 6.2 or higher.
- CentOS 6 or 7 is preferred, but the software can run on Ubuntu with specific additions.
- Only users that are member of the Keeper Admins Security group will be permitted
  to login to the Tray application and configure the service.
- For a multi-domain forest create this group as a universal group so that users in
  this group are cached in the Global Catalog.
- Ensure the Email Property (typically “mail” or “userPrincipalName”) in Directory
  Service Options is set to the correct value to pick up the user's Email address.
- Uses SAML 2.0 for authentication
- SSO Connect On-Prem SSL certificates must be updated on an annual basis, or there
  may be times that the metadata.xml file needs to be updated on the SSO Connect server.
- If multiple SSO Connect servers (HA configuration) are present in your architecture,
  no further steps are required as each subsequent SSO Connect server will synchronize
  to the cloud and update.
- To force the sync, click on “Full Sync” on the SSO connect menu on each server.
- Do not delete the SSO Connect provisioning instance on the Admin Console. Doing
  so will remove the configuration and orphan your SSO Connect servers.
- The Admin Login does not allow the user name to be changed.
- Two Factor Authentication will be prompted when enabled for the Admin account.
- The Admin login will be retained by the bridge service in volatile memory and used
  to assign users to their teams as required.
- The Admin remains logged in until the Keeper Bridge Service or the system to which
  it is installed is restarted.
- Each HA instance must run the same version of SSO Connect
- If using a private IP, set it up in the Configuration dialog.
- Each subsequent server added to an SSO Connect provisioning method will automatically
  download the configuration and user SSO data when the SSO Connect successfully authenticates
  as an administrator with the SSO permission.
- Each server will need to be at the same Keeper SSO Connect version.
- If the initial SSO Connect server had the Private IP address configured, that data
  does not synchronize with the SSO Connect configuration since in most cases the
  private IP is unique to the individual server.
- If the host-name is changing with the new server, the host-name will need to be
  updated in the SSO Connect configuration.
- If the host-name changes, it may affect the SSL certificate.
- When the configuration is saved on one server it replicated to the cloud and synchronizes
  to the other servers.
- In multi-domain forest configurations, uncheck the Use Global Catalog option.
- If using SSL for LDAP authentication, ensure the SSL box is checked.
- These examples assumes a Secrets Manager config file has already been initialized.
