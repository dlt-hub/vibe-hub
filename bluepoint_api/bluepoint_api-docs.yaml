auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.bluepoint.io/:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Applications are created at https://www.bluepoint.io/api-access/
    where you obtain an application secret that must be saved at creation time as
    it is only displayed once. Each request must include the api-version header set
    to the current version like api-version: 2024-02-23. M2M apps have an associated
    system user and role that control API access permissions. The documentation references
    an OAS 3.0 schema at https://api.bluepoint.io/schema.yaml for complete authentication
    details including how to send credentials in requests.'
  - 'The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication in two modes: M2M and User.
    For M2M mode, generate a JWT using the application ID and secret with a payload
    containing sub (application ID) and iat (Unix timestamp in seconds). The JWT is
    sent via request headers on each request. Use the PyJWT package to generate tokens
    with the application secret as the signing key. The application secret is only
    displayed once upon generation and cannot be retrieved again.'
  - The API uses OAuth2 / Auth0 for authentication. After user login via Auth0 redirect,
    the API returns a JWT token in the response body as {"token":"JWT_STRING"}. This
    JWT must be included in the "Authorization" header as "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" along
    with the "api-version" header on every request. The JWT includes an expiration
    time in the "exp" field of the payload that should be checked before use, and
    a new token should be obtained if expired.
  - Use OAuth2 with Auth0. First, obtain an application_id from the API access page,
    then make a GET request to https://api.bluepoint.io/users/login with the application_id
    query parameter. This returns a redirectUrl pointing to Auth0's authorize endpoint
    where the user logs in. After successful authentication, Auth0 redirects back
    to https://api.bluepoint.io/user/token/?application_id=[your_application_id] with
    an authorization code, which should be exchanged for an access token. The access
    token is then used in subsequent API requests, likely in an Authorization header
    as a Bearer token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.bluepoint.io/:
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, I can identify pagination information:


    The API uses next and previous fields in the response to indicate pagination state.
    The results array contains the paginated data. When next is null, there are no
    more pages to fetch; otherwise, use the next value to construct the subsequent
    request. The previous field similarly indicates whether a previous page exists.'
