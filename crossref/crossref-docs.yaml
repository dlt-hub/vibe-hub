notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- We’re celebrating our 25th anniversary this year.
- Requests containing a query parameter are frequently finding more results than previously.
- The filters has-funder and has-funder DOI are picking up about 5% more records than
  previously.
- The behaviour of the total-results field for the has-update filter has changed.
- Meaningful whitespace removed from JSON REST API
- No easy or short-term solutions to fully address the problem of duplicate DOIs.
- Members can use conflict reports to confirm if the conflict genuinely is a duplicate
  DOI.
- If you modify your file to be tab separated and then resubmit it, you should no
  longer receive error messages.
- You don’t need to modify 'registrant' field.
- Only DOIs of the same owning prefix may be updated together using the specified
  header.
- To be eligible to use the Similarity Check service, register full-text URLs for
  more than 90% of your content.
- To be eligible to use the Similarity Check service we need to register full-text
  URLs for Similarity Check pointing to the full-text article for more than 90% of
  our content.
- The best format for only Similarity Check URLs is CSV file and upload at Web Deposit
  Form.
- Webinar registration link available.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Join us 22-23 October as we come together to explore where we’ve been and where
  we’re going.
- Merging the two registries will make workflows more efficient and less confusing
  for all concerned.
- Some objects like DOI may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The DOI resolution URL provided by the publisher may be incorrect, leading to 404
  errors.
- We’ve been accelerating our metadata development efforts and recently released version
  5.4 of our metadata schema, and are planning to release version 5.5 this summer.
- We drive metadata exchange to facilitate global research communication.
- We're open infrastructure that links research objects, entities, and actions, creating
  a lasting and reusable scholarly record.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Crossref
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Experience issues with deposits on Metadata Manager.
- We don’t have a formal relationship with Google or Google Scholar, so registering
  your records with Crossref doesn’t necessarily guarantee inclusion there.
- The Cited-by system has not yet processed the data.
- A DOI is not strictly required for the Cited-by service.
- 'In some cases, when sending a metadata deposit containing citations, the result
  contains multiple citation keys for one of the source citations, prefixed with #cr-split.'
- Some DOIs may not be activated if not properly registered.
- The test system is good for testing the process of submitting files, but it won’t
  always sync up with the real data in the production system.
- Transitioning from email notifications to callback notifications.
- Our citation matching system has a feature where it checks for instances where an
  <unstructured_citation> could inadvertently contain two references, rather than
  just one.
- There are a number of ways a reference might be formatted such that it will be split,
  including having either a colon or semi-colon.
- DOIs within the reference metadata indicate a match with another Crossref DOI.
- Unfortunately, the only way to reject a false positive would be to manually start
  the match process over again by refreshing the Simple Text Query form and changing
  the reference(s) in question.
- The test system may produce errors that do not occur in production.
- Metadata exchange to facilitate global research communication.
- Webinar will be presented in Brazilian Portuguese and will last 45 minutes including
  time for questions.
- The session will last 45 minutes, including time for questions, and will be recorded.
- Accurate DOI metadata is essential for citation accuracy and discoverability.
- If a DOI is present in the reference metadata, it indicates a match with another
  Crossref DOI.
- Metadata completeness affects the ability to establish reference matches.
- The only way to reject a false positive would be to manually start the match process
  over again by refreshing the Simple Text Query form and changing the reference(s)
  in question.
- Webinar session will last 45 minutes, including time for questions.
- Slides and recordings will be shared later.
