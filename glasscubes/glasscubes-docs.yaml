auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.glasscubes.com/collaboration/api-documentation/index.html:
  - API uses token-based authentication with access and refresh tokens. Send the access_token
    in the Authorization header for subsequent requests. Tokens expire after a specified
    duration in seconds; use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token when needed.
    Authentication is performed via POST to /v2/auth/{cid}/passwd with email and password
    credentials, returning access_token, refresh_token, and expiresIn in the response
    body.
  - Glasscubes uses OAuth2-style authentication with client credentials and user access
    tokens. Register your application to obtain a client_id and client_secret, then
    call the /auth/{cid}/passwd endpoint with the user's email and password (where
    {cid} is the Account ID) to retrieve an access_token and refresh_token. Include
    the access_token in subsequent API requests; tokens expire after 24 hours and
    can be refreshed using the /auth/refresh endpoint with the refresh_token. Call
    /auth/accounts with the user's email to obtain their Account ID.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used for authentication. Exchange an OAuth code
    (received via redirect URL with query parameter aouthcode=xxxxx) for a Bearer
    Token by posting to /v2/auth/code. The OAuth code is valid for 5 minutes and can
    only be exchanged once. The response includes access_token, refresh_token, and
    expiresIn fields. Use the access_token as a Bearer Token in subsequent requests.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access_token and refresh_token
    by calling the authAs endpoint (requires Admin permission and a user ID path parameter).
    Use the access_token in subsequent API requests; tokens expire after the expiresIn
    seconds value, at which point use the refresh_token to request a new access_token.
    Send the Bearer token in the Authorization header for API calls.
  - The API uses token-based authentication with access and refresh tokens. Clients
    receive an access_token in the TokenResponse upon authentication, which is used
    to authorize subsequent requests. The token expires after a specified duration
    in seconds (expiresIn), and a refresh_token can be used to obtain a new access_token
    when the current one expires. The API also supports SSO via SAML-compliant identity
    providers.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.glasscubes.com/collaboration/api-documentation/index.html:
  - Pagination uses currentPage and nextPage integer fields in the response. To paginate,
    pass the nextPage value as a query parameter in the next request; stop when nextPage
    is not returned or is null.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: pass page (integer, optional) in the
    request to retrieve paginated results, and the response includes page (current
    page number) and moreAvailable (boolean indicating if more results exist). Continue
    requesting with incremented page values until moreAvailable is false.'
  - Pagination uses offset-based scheme with currentPage and nextPage integer fields
    in the response. Request pagination via query parameters (exact names not specified
    in provided text), and navigate by using the nextPage value from the response
    to construct subsequent requests.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: be (default 0) and count (default
    30). The response includes nextPageFirst field; use its value as the be parameter
    in the next request to retrieve subsequent results.'
  - The /v2/search endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. Use the first query parameter
    (optional, defaults to 0) to specify the starting position, and count (optional,
    defaults to 30) to specify results per request. For subsequent requests, set first
    to the previously returned SearchResults.nextPageFirst value. Continue paginating
    until no nextPageFirst is returned in the response.
