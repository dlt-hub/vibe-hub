notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires specific permissions for accessing fact metrics and tables.
- Revenue Metrics are displayed in USD by default. You can change your display currency
  under Settings → General → Metric Settings.
- Conversions within the first X hours of being put into an experiment are ignored
  (default = 0).
- The metric delay can also be negative to include some conversions before a user
  is put into an experiment.
- No raw user-level events or PII are ever sent to GrowthBook.
- 'GrowthBook is warehouse native: it connects to your data warehouse and queries
  it to get the results of your experiments.'
- SDK should implement reconnect logic to support both client and server dropping
  the connection.
- 'The API response may contain a response header: x-sse-support: enabled'
- SSO is available as part of our Enterprise plan.
- 'For GrowthBook Cloud, you will need to send your account representative the following:
  CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, EMAIL_DOMAIN, what provider you''re using, and for some
  providers, the TENANT_ID.'
- SCIM is only available with an Enterprise plan and requires Single Sign-On (SSO)
  to be enabled.
- Currently, GrowthBook only supports Okta and Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID as the
  identity providers.
- If self-hosting GrowthBook on a VPN or behind a firewall, allowlist Okta's IP addresses
  to ensure SCIM API calls can hit GrowthBook's SCIM server.
- If self-hosting GrowthBook on a VPN or behind a firewall, allowlist Azure AD's/Entra
  ID's IP addresses to ensure the SCIM API calls can hit GrowthBook's SCIM server.
- These logs are useful for auditing what users have done, and figuring out the cause
  of any issues.
- Users can only run read SELECT queries in GrowthBook.
- Write operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc, are not permitted from any
  user-entered SQL.
- The actual values of the targeting attributes are never sent to GrowthBook and are
  only stored in memory locally within the SDK.
- ID Lists are limited to 1 MB. Using multiple, large ID Lists may impact performance
  as it increases the SDK payload.
- Default display currency is USD, but you can change it under Settings → General
  → Metric Settings
- Metric slices are available for Enterprise customers only.
- The use of the mongo image within the docker-compose.yml is meant to quickly get
  a dev or staging environment up and running.
- For production you may want to use a more scalable and stable solution (ie. AWS
  DocumentDB, Google Cloud MongoDB Atlas, Azure Cosmos DB for Mongo, etc.)
errors:
- '400: Bad Request - Often due to a missing required parameter'
- '401: Unauthorized - No valid API key provided'
- '402: Request Failed - The parameters are valid, but the request failed'
- '403: Forbidden - Provided API key does not have the required access'
- '404: Not Found - Unknown API route or requested resource'
- '429: Too Many Requests - You exceeded the rate limit of 60 requests per minute.
  Try again later.'
- '5XX: Server Error - Something went wrong on GrowthBook''s end (these are rare)'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or authentication method'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '400 Bad Request: Check your request syntax or parameters.'
- '404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.'
- '500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server.'
- If a user is deprovisioned in your identity provider, they will be removed from
  GrowthBook.
- If you use Okta and notice that some users that you expect to be in your GrowthBook
  team from your identity provider are not being added in GrowthBook, double check
  that those users are assigned to the GrowthBook SCIM application in your identity
  provider.
- Existing users in GrowthBook will not be affected by SCIM.
