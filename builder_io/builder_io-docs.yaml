auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.builder.io/c/docs/admin-graphql-api:
  - Authentication requires including an Authorization header with a Builder private
    Space key. The key should be prefixed with `bpk` and is passed via the `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY`
    environment variable when using the Admin SDK's `createAdminApiClient()` function.
    For direct GraphQL API access to the endpoint https://cdn.builder.io/api/v2/admin,
    include this private key in the Authorization header.
  - Use Builder's Admin API as a GraphQL API with back-end servers for administrative
    tasks. Authentication requires an API key passed as the apiKey query parameter
    or in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The exact header name and parameter
    names are not fully specified in the provided text.
- information_source; https://www.builder.io/c/docs/code-flow:
  - 'Builder.io supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) for SSO with two flows: code flow (when
    a Client Secret is provided) or implicit flow (when no Client Secret is included).
    The Client Secret is configured in Builder''s Organization Settings under Single
    Sign-On, SSO Method set to OpenID Connect, in the Client Secret field.'
  - OpenID Connect (OIDC) builds on OAuth 2.0 and is used for authenticating users
    and retrieving their basic information in a standardized way. OAuth 2.0 supports
    different authorization strategies, including code flow which is available on
    enterprise plans.
- information_source; https://www.builder.io/c/docs/content-api:
  - Use the Content API by providing your Public API Key as the `apiKey` query parameter
    in requests to `https://cdn.builder.io/api/v3/content/{model-name}?apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY}`.
    Replace the model name and API key with your own values.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.builder.io/c/docs/content-api:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with `offset` and `limit` parameters. The
    `offset` parameter (default 0) specifies the starting position, and `limit` controls
    results per page (max 100). Paginate by incrementing `offset` by the number of
    results returned until fewer results than the limit are returned, indicating the
    final page.
