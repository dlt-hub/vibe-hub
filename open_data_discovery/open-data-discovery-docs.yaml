notes:
- ODD Platform requires consumers of the Ingestion API to use the same ODDRN strings
  for the same entities.
- ODD Platform requires consumers of the Ingestion API (ODD Collectors and self-written
  agents) to use the same ODDRN strings for the same entities.
- The platform utilizes PostgreSQL replication mechanism to ensure notifications are
  sent even in the event of network lag or platform crashes.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- If users chose to set the `enabled` parameter to `false`, then they also need to
  remember to also configure the database so it doesn’t save logs for notifications.
- Filtering configuration is optional and if not to configured, Collectors will retrieve
  all available metadata from the source.
- Attachment size should not exceed 20MB
- A single data entity has the capability to accommodate multiple files and links
- Filtering configuration is optional and if not configured, Collectors will retrieve
  all available metadata from the source.
- This functionality is not the preferred method and is disabled by default
- Secure this connection as well, as you can
- Each time the table structure is modified, a new revision of structure is generated,
  allowing table version differences to be tracked.
- The attachment size should not exceed 20MB.
- Customer full name, age, address and payment details should be anonymized as these
  are PII data protected by GDPR and PCI DSS.
- Deprecation process is well-managed, all users are notified in advance and risks
  mitigated.
- ODD is compatible with Great Expectations and Pandas Profiling.
- The ODD Platform is compatible with Great Expectations and Pandas Profiling.
- Set to streaming data load mode.
- Has a history depth of ten calendar years.
- Contains all sales data, not just the one of customers subscribed to a newsletter.
- Has a denormalized structure.
- Has a history depth of ten calendar year.
- Has denormalized structure.
- This configuration is basic and best suited as a demo sandbox.
- You should be able to see new data sources and data entities that correspond with
  them.
- In this setup there are no certificates created to use encrypted communication.
- Only http protocol is supported in this setup.
- In this setup there are no certificates created to use encrypted communication.
  Be aware that only http protocol is supported in this setup.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Ensure the Slack application is properly configured with required scopes.
- ODD Platform supports various types of authentication methods and allows users to
  customize access control rules freely.
- Authentication mechanisms supported by ODD Platform.
- Requires setup of Slack application with specified scopes.
- It is very important to have fine-grained access control in your data catalog.
- The easiest way to have ODD Platform at your disposal locally is to launch a PostgreSQL
  docker container as a ODD Platform's database using docker-compose
- libraries pyodbc , confluent-kafka and grpcio have problem during installing and
  building project on M1 Macbooks.
- Build and run section of the whole ODD infrastructure
- The easiest way to have ODD Platform at your disposal locally is to launch a PostgreSQL
  docker container as a ODD Platform's database using docker-compose.
- Create collector in the ODD Platform and copy created token using the guide.
