auth_info:
- information_source; https://packagist.org/apidoc:
  - 'API key authentication is required via the Authorization header using a bearer
    token format. Send the request with the header Authorization: Bearer [your_api_key]
    to authenticate access to the package creation endpoint.'
  - 'Authentication can be done using Bearer token or query/request parameters. Bearer
    token method uses the header `Authorization: Bearer [username]:[apiToken]`. Alternatively,
    pass `username` and `apiToken` as query or POST parameters. Two API tokens are
    available from the profile page: SAFE token for readonly operations and MAIN token
    for unsafe endpoints.'
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token scheme. Send the API token in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer USERNAME:TOKEN`, where USERNAME and TOKEN are
    obtained from your Packagist profile. The main API token is required for unsafe
    endpoints (create-package, edit package), while either the main or safe API token
    works for safe endpoints (update-package).'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer USERNAME:TOKEN" where USERNAME and TOKEN are obtained from your
    Packagist profile API token page. The token can be either a main or safe token.
- information_source; https://packagist.org/packages/forecho/yii2-rest-api:
  - JWT Bearer token authentication is used. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" where {token} is a JWT. Tokens can be refreshed by making
    a POST request to the refresh-token endpoint with the current token in the Authorization
    header, which returns a new token in the response data.
