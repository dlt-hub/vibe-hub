auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.timesheet.io:
  - 'API Key authentication is required for all requests. Send your API Key in the
    Authorization header using the format `Authorization: ApiKey {api_key}`, where
    the key has format `ts_{prefix}.{secret}`. API Keys are generated at https://my.timesheet.io/development
    with configurable permissions and optional expiration dates. Store keys securely
    in environment variables and never expose them in client-side code or version
    control. All requests must use HTTPS.'
  - 'API Key authentication is required. Send your API Key in the `Authorization`
    header as a bearer token (format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`). API Keys
    can be managed in developer settings and should be stored in environment variables,
    never hardcoded. Rotate keys every 90 days, use read-only keys when appropriate,
    and monitor usage for suspicious activity. Invalid or expired keys return 401
    Unauthorized, insufficient permissions return 403 Forbidden, and exceeded rate
    limits return 429 Too Many Requests.'
  - 'API supports two authentication methods: bearerAuth (Bearer token in Authorization
    header) and apiKeyAuth (API key, likely in Authorization header or as a query
    parameter). Specific header/parameter names and exact key transmission method
    are not detailed in the provided documentation.'
  - 'API supports two authentication methods: bearerAuth (Bearer token in Authorization
    header) and apiKeyAuth (API key, likely in a header or query parameter). The specific
    header names and parameter names for apiKeyAuth are not explicitly documented
    in the provided text.'
  - All API requests require authentication using either OAuth2 Bearer Token or API
    Key. For OAuth2, use the Authorization Code Flow, Client Credentials, or Refresh
    Token grant types. For API Key authentication, send the key as a server-to-server
    credential. The documentation does not specify exact header names, parameter names,
    or token acquisition endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.timesheet.io:
  - Pagination information is present in the provided documentation. The API supports
    offset and limit-based pagination. The request includes "limit" (default 0) and
    "offset" (default 0) query parameters to control page size and starting position.
    Use these parameters to paginate through results by incrementing offset by the
    limit value for each subsequent request.
  - 'Pagination is controlled by request body parameters: page (integer), limit (integer),
    count (integer), and offset (integer). The documentation does not specify response
    fields indicating pagination state, next/previous page information, or when to
    stop paginating.'
  - 'Pagination is controlled via request body parameters: page (integer) and limit
    (integer) specify which page to retrieve and results per page. The response includes
    paginated results; use incremented page values to fetch subsequent pages until
    no more results are returned.'
  - 'Pagination is controlled via request body parameters: page (integer), limit (integer),
    count (integer), and offset (integer). The response structure is not fully shown,
    but these parameters indicate offset-based or limit-offset pagination where page
    and limit determine which results are returned.'
  - 'Pagination is controlled via request body parameters: page (integer), limit (integer),
    offset (integer), and count (integer). The documentation does not specify response
    fields indicating pagination state or how to construct subsequent requests.'
