  - Authentication is required via the Authorization header using basic auth credentials
    (username and password). The user must have the mica-administrator role to access
    this endpoint. Credentials are sent as base64-encoded "username:password" in the
    Authorization header.
  - Authentication is required with user credentials (username and password) and a
    user must have the mica-administrator, mica-reviewer, or mica-editor role. Use
    HTTP Basic Authentication by passing the username and password via the -u flag
    in cURL or equivalent authentication headers. The Authorization header should
    contain Base64-encoded credentials in the format "username:password".
  - Authorization header is required. Use Bearer token scheme with a valid access
    token obtained through the API's authentication mechanism. Send the token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
  - The Authorization header is required and must follow RFC 7235 standard format.
    Authentication details are described in the Authentication section of the API
    documentation. Specific endpoints require roles such as mica-administrator, mica-reviewer,
    or mica-editor.
