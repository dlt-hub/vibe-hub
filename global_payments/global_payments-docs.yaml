  : - Send the customerId and cardNumberToken parameters encrypted in the request
      body. Include the Apiversion and Encryptionmode headers, plus an iv header for

    - The API uses token-based authentication via query parameters. Required parameters
      are token (an MD5 hash), merchantId (your merchant ID), and transactions (transaction
      IDs to check). The token parameter must contain an MD5 hash of specific data
      (exact composition not detailed in excerpt). All credentials are passed as query
      string parameters in the request URL.

    with value "Basic" followed by Base64-encoded CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET. Make a
    POST request to the /epgpay-auth/login endpoint with grant_type=client_credentials
    to obtain an access_token (bearer token) that expires after the time specified
    in expires_in.
  - 'The API uses OAuth2 with client credentials authentication. To obtain a token,
    send a request to the Authorization Server with an Authorization header using
    basic authentication, where the credentials are Base64-encoded client_id and client_secret
    in the format "Authorization: Basic Base64(client_id:client_secret)". The client_id
    and client_secret are assigned to registered OAuth applications and must be included
    in every request to the OAuth token endpoint.'
