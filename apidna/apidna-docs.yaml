notes:
- Maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date documentation can be resource-intensive.
- APIDNA takes the complexity out of API integrations.
- Our platform automates the most challenging aspects, allowing you to focus on creating
  value-added features for your applications.
- No hidden costs or fees in the pricing structure.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Use standardized formats like JSON for inputs and outputs.
- Clear and descriptive error messages are essential for debugging.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Read the official API documentation to ensure understanding of endpoints and authentication
  methods.
- API error handling is critical to maintaining the stability of applications and
  ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Autonomous agents could revolutionise the process by automatically monitoring, detecting,
  and resolving API errors in real-time.
- Autonomous agents can automate error detection and classification in real-time.
- Proactive monitoring reduces the risk of system failures.
- Dynamic scaling is essential for handling fluctuating traffic.
- Manual scaling often leads to inefficiencies.
- API caching is a critical technique in modern software development.
- Cached responses can become outdated over time.
- API Rate Limiting and Throttling are crucial techniques for managing traffic and
  ensuring the stability of API-driven applications.
- Standardising inputs and outputs is essential for seamless integration.
- Machine learning is a powerful technology with the potential to revolutionise industries
  and create innovative solutions to complex problems.
- AI significantly boosts user satisfaction by predicting peak times and optimising
  resource allocation.
- AI proactively anticipates and mitigates potential scalability bottlenecks.
- AI enhances cost-efficiency through predictive analytics.
- Thoroughly Understand API Documentation.
- Properly Handle Authentication and Authorization.
- Implement Error Handling and Graceful Degradation.
- Mind Rate Limits and Usage Guidelines.
- Essential for any large project to use a more comprehensive form of version control
- Good documentation can be the deciding factor in whether other developers choose
  to use your API or move on to another.
- Clarity and conciseness in API documentation make it approachable and understandable,
  especially for developers who are new to your API.
- Data privacy is an essential concept for developers and businesses to understand.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in APIDNA
- APIs facilitate the communication backbone of microservices
- APIs implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect each service
- Efficient management also includes exporting data and removing unused or redundant
  API providers to maintain a clean, optimised environment.
- API integration testing is crucial for ensuring robust connections between systems.
- Data privacy is essential for API integrations, especially with laws like GDPR and
  CCPA.
- AI plays a pivotal role in streamlining API planning and design.
- AI-driven development and testing significantly streamline API lifecycle management.
- Data streaming is pivotal in modern software development.
- Effective API testing is essential to ensure that API integrations work seamlessly.
- API security testing is non-negotiable.
- Machine learning algorithms enhance applications in various ways.
- 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances security by adding an additional layer of
  protection to API management systems.
- GDPR compliance is maintained with tools for data retention and consent management.
- Developers are forced to spend more time on tedious processes instead of focusing
  on innovation and building powerful features.
- The result is a more efficient workflow where developers can concentrate on what
  matters most—delivering high-quality APIs faster, without being bogged down by the
  intricate technicalities of configuration.
- Client mapping involves transforming client-specific data structures into the format
  expected by the server.
- Ensuring data integrity during the mapping process is crucial.
- Real-time APIs utilise technologies such as WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  to deliver data with minimal latency.
- SSE includes built-in support for automatic reconnection.
- Response mapping is crucial for ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- Autonomous agents automate response mapping, reducing the need for manual coding.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API requires setup of connected app in APIDNA
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- 'Invalid API key: Please check your credentials'
- 'Rate limit exceeded: Please reduce the number of requests.'
- Error logs may lack useful detail or consistency.
- Performance issues can cause larger system failures.
- 'Stale data: Cached responses can become outdated.'
- 'Cache invalidation: Deciding when to refresh or discard cached data.'
- '400 Bad Request: The request sent by the client is invalid or malformed, often
  due to missing or incorrect parameters.'
- '401 Unauthorized: The client lacks proper authentication credentials or the provided
  credentials are invalid for accessing the requested resource.'
- '404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server, typically
  due to a mistyped URL or an outdated link.'
- '500 Internal Server Error: Represents a generic error message indicating that something
  unexpected went wrong on the server’s end, often due to an internal server malfunction
  or a programming error.'
