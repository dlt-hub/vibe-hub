notes:
- Implement OAuth or token-based auth, encrypt data at rest and in transit
- JWTs enhance API security through several important mechanisms.
- This policy is only available as part of our enterprise plans.
- HTTP 429 errors can be triggered by various situations, such as automated scripts,
  bots, or even legitimate users making too many requests within a short period.
- Implementing API Rate Limiting is essential to maintain the integrity of the API
  and safeguard against abuse or degraded performance.
- Subaccounts allow for finer-grain control and tracking over API integrations.
- API management with built-in observability features designed specifically for developer
  teams.
- Problem Details provide a standardized structure for error responses.
- Implementing rate limiting in Python requires careful consideration of various factors.
- Libraries like Flask-Limiter simplify the process.
- Ecommerce APIs must address complex regulatory requirements.
- In the competitive ecommerce environment, API features drive platform adoption.
- Financial APIs require enterprise-grade security and reliability.
- Modern fintech APIs implement OAuth 2.0 for authorization and encryption for data
  protection.
- APIs can be considered products and should be marketed during development.
- Zuplo automatically generates a UI for your API documentation based on the OpenAPI
  JSON you provided.
- Joining a unified API can help with marketing your API and improving discoverability
- API Marketing focuses on promoting and driving adoption of your APIs.
- Make generating API keys painless
- Have a playground in the docs
- Let me test it for free for a while
