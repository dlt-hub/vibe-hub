auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/api/authentication.htm:
  - 'API authentication requires sending two custom headers with every request: x-API-Id
    (your API ID) and x-API-Key (your API key). API functionality is determined by
    the roles and permissions assigned to your user account, managed through the API
    Key Management interface.'
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/account-export-api-definition.htm:
  - API ID and API Key authentication via headers. Send x-API-Id and x-API-Key as
    required header parameters in requests to the /v3/export endpoint. The x-API-Id
    is created and managed in the Imperva Cloud Security Console for authentication
    purposes.
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/api/website-certificate-restful.htm:
  - API requests require two custom headers for authentication. Send x-API-Id and
    x-API-Key headers with your credentials. Additionally, include the caid query
    parameter with your account ID in the request URL.
  - 'Imperva version 3 RESTful APIs use API key authentication with two required headers:
    x-API-Id and x-API-Key. Additionally, the account ID must be passed as a query
    parameter caid in the request URL.'
  - 'The API uses header-based authentication with two required headers: x-API-Id
    and x-API-Key. Additionally, the account ID must be passed as a query parameter
    caid in the request URL.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/api/api-overview-v1.htm:
  - Use query parameters page_size (optional, default 50, maximum 100) and page_num
    (optional, default 0) to paginate results. Increment page_num starting from 0
    to retrieve successive pages until all results are obtained.
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/audit-trail-api-definition.htm:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter controls
    the number of objects returned per request (default 50, maximum 100), and the
    offset parameter specifies the starting position for retrieving results. Continue
    paginating by incrementing the offset value until fewer results than the limit
    are returned.
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/website-domain-api-definition.htm:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNumber (starting from 0, default 0) and pageSize
    (number of objects per response, default 50, maximum 100). To paginate, increment
    pageNumber and repeat the request until all results are retrieved.
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/advanced-bot-protection-api-definition.htm:
  - Resources may be paginated, indicated by the inclusion of 'next' and/or 'prev'
    relations in the '_links' property. Use these link relations to navigate between
    pages.
- information_source; https://docs-cybersec.thalesgroup.com/bundle/api-docs/page/traffic-stats-api-definition.htm:
  - Use page_size query parameter to control pagination, with a default of 50 and
    maximum of 100 objects per response. No response fields or navigation mechanism
    for moving between pages are documented.
