auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.reco.ai/hub/workday-rest-api-integration-security:
  - Workday REST APIs require OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access using access
    tokens. The basic URL structure is https://{host}/ccx/api/v1/{tenant}/{resource},
    where {host} is the Workday API endpoint domain and {tenant} is your tenant identifier.
    Access tokens must be obtained through the OAuth 2.0 flow and sent with requests
    to authenticate and authorize API access to resources like employee records, job
    requisitions, and benefits data.
  - Workday uses OAuth2 Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access_token and refresh_token
    from the OAuth2 token endpoint, then include the access_token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>" for API requests to endpoints like GET https://<your_workday_domain>/ccx/api/v1/<tenant>/workers.
  - Workday's REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. All API calls must be authenticated
    using OAuth 2.0 to maintain secure access. The documentation emphasizes implementing
    least privilege access by assigning only necessary permissions for each user or
    system.
