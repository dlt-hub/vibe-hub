auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/using-platform-apis:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used for initial destination setup, requiring Base64-encoded
    clientId:clientSecret in the Authorization header as "Basic <Base64EncodedCredentials>".
    Subsequently, Bearer token authentication is required for platform API calls,
    with the access token passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token_value>".
  - OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant is used for platform API authentication. To
    authenticate, create an OAuth client in the SAP BTP cockpit (Security > OAuth
    > Platform API tab) which generates a client ID and client secret. Use these credentials
    with the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow to obtain a JWT access token
    from the OAuth access token endpoint. Reuse the same access token throughout its
    validity period instead of requesting a new token for each API call.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain access tokens. Send a POST request
    to the token endpoint with Basic authentication, where the Authorization header
    contains Base-64 encoded clientID:clientSecret. The response includes access_token
    (valid for expires_in seconds, default 1500), token_type (Bearer), and scope parameters.
- information_source; https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/api-documentation:
  - The OData APIs are protected by basic authentication using username and password
    credentials. Send credentials via the standard HTTP Authorization header with
    Basic scheme encoding.
- information_source; https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/exporting-workspace-snapshots:
  - 'Authorization is performed using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN} where {ACCESS_TOKEN} is
    your access token obtained from the authentication service.'

  : - Pagination in REST APIs uses query parameters page (starting from page 1, or
      optionally 0 which returns same result as page 1) and page_size to control results.
      The response includes a page field indicating the current page number.
- information_source; https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/exporting-workspace-snapshots:
  - 'The `/exports` endpoint supports pagination via optional query parameters: `pageSize`
    (controls number of results per page) and `sorting`/`sortDirection` (for ordering).
    The response returns a data array with export records; repeatedly call the endpoint
    to monitor export status until it reaches `COMPLETED`, at which point a `downloadKey`
    becomes available for file download.'
