pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.cookpolitical.com/api/documentation:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a `page` parameter (query parameter).
    Results are paginated because more than 1000 sources cannot be returned in a single
    query. The `page` parameter must be larger than 0, with 0 as the default, and
    is used in GET requests like `https://www.cookpolitical.com/api/race/house?page=2`
    to retrieve subsequent result sets sequentially.
