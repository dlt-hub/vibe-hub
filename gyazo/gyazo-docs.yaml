auth_info:
- information_source; https://gyazo.com/api/docs/auth:
  - Gyazo API supports two authentication methods. For simple authentication without
    user login, use client_id as a query parameter. For OAuth2.0 user authentication,
    obtain an access_token and pass it either as an access_token query parameter or
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". Register your application
    to get client_id and client_secret; keep client_secret secure and never expose
    it in public code.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. To authenticate, redirect users to GET
    /oauth/authorize with required parameters client_id, redirect_uri, and response_type
    set to "code". After user authorization, exchange the returned authorization code
    for an access token via POST /oauth/token using client_id, client_secret, code,
    and grant_type parameters. Use the optional state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks.
- information_source; https://gyazo.com/api/docs?lang=en:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header ''Authorization'': ''Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'' where YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    is your OAuth2 access token obtained from Gyazo.'
  - The Gyazo API uses Bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization header
    with the value "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" where YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN is your actual
    access token obtained from Gyazo.
  - The Gyazo API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" when making requests to the
    upload endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://gyazo.com/api/docs?lang=en:
  - The API uses query parameters page (starting at 1) and per (results per page,
    default 10) to paginate search results. The response includes a number_of_captures
    field indicating total results, and you continue requesting with incremented page
    values until fewer results than per are returned.
  - The search images endpoint uses query parameters page (starting at 1) and per
    (items per page, default 10) to paginate results. The response returns a captures
    array; construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter until
    no more results are returned.
