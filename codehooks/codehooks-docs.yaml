auth_info:
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/rest-api-app-routes:
  - Codehooks API routes require an API key passed in the x-apikey header. Include
    the header x-apikey with your API key value (e.g., 6e111ea6-6b3a-412d-8f6b-061c816c67c9)
    in all requests to authenticate.
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/client-code-examples:
  - Authentication is required via the x-apikey header. Include the header x-apikey
    with your API key value in all requests to the API endpoint.
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/appeventapi:
  - Must include x-apikey header for authentication when calling other Codehooks APIs
    via app.internalFetch(). Send the API key in the x-apikey header if the target
    API is not public.
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/authentication:
  - 'Application APIs can be accessed with secure tokens: either JWT tokens from providers
    like Auth0.com or API tokens created via CLI or admin application. API tokens
    are sent as the x-apikey HTTP header in requests. Tokens can have READ or other
    access levels and should only be used server-side, not from web pages.'
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/authhooks:
  - 'Auth hooks allow you to override default security behavior on specific routes
    by implementing custom authentication logic. When a request matches an auth hook
    route and no authentication token is present in headers, the auth function is
    invoked to allow (via next()) or block (via response.end()) the request.


    The example shows custom header-based authentication using the X-challenge header,
    where you can implement any custom auth function to validate incoming requests
    against your own rules.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://codehooks.io/docs/database-rest-api:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset as query parameters. limit specifies the maximum
    number of results to return per request, and offset specifies how many results
    to skip. The response is an array of JSON documents; construct subsequent requests
    by incrementing offset by the limit value until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - The API supports offset-based pagination for listing documents. Use the `limit`
    query parameter to specify the number of results (e.g., `?limit=2`) and the `offset`
    query parameter to skip forward in the result set. The response returns an array
    of JSON documents; continue paginating by incrementing the offset value until
    fewer results than the limit are returned.
