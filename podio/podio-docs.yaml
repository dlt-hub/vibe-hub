notes:
- The general limit is 1,000 API calls per hour, but if the API call is marked as
  'Rate limited' the call is deemed resource intensive and a lower rate of 250 calls
  per hour is enforced.
- If you hit the rate limits the API will begin returning 420 HTTP error codes for
  all API calls.
- Access Token is valid for 8 hours.
- Refresh Token is valid for 28 days.
- The Podio API is based on REST requests passing JSON back and forth.
- If you need only to interact with a single Podio app from your code and you don't
  want to bother with a full login flow, we recommend using app authentication.
- Only hooks on port 80 and 443 are supported.
- Events will only be sent to the endpoint after a completed verification.
- You can have up to 10 webhooks of each type (create, update, delete etc.) of each
  item, app, comment etc.
- Only hooks on port 80 and 443 are supported
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Most operations returning a list of objects support options limiting and sorting
  the result.
- Tasks can be used as todo list for yourself and to assign work to be done to other
  people.
- Tasks can also be private or public, they can have a due date, they can include
  one or more files and they can be organized with custom labels.
- Files can be uploaded to Podio, but they don't stand on their own, they are always
  attached to another object.
- The maximum allowed file size is currently 100MB.
- Whenever you subscribe to a channel you need to provide extra information in the
  subscribe call for each channel.
- Hooks needs to be verified before they become active
- The hook must respond with a 2xx status code
- The sandbox only handles GET operations for now.
errors:
- '420: Rate limit exceeded'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code will throw an exception.
- All unsuccessful responses returned by the API (everything that has a 4xx or 5xx
  HTTP status code) will throw an exception.
- '409 Conflict: Check for conflicts with the specified revision.'
