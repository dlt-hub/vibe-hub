auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.barterassets.com/api-integration:
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key to the SDK client during
    initialization (e.g., `barter_solutions.Client('your-api-key')`) or generate credentials
    from your developer account dashboard. The API key is used to authenticate requests
    to endpoints like GET /api/v1/account and transaction creation endpoints.
  - Secure Authentication using OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication methods. Rate
    limiting is applied to both authentication schemes. Public API access is coming
    in Q3 2025, currently available for partners only.
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Pass your API key as a bearer token
    in the Authorization header (format: "Bearer your-api-key"). Alternatively, initialize
    the client SDK by passing the API key directly to the constructor (e.g., barter_solutions.Client(''your-api-key'')).'
