notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ExpressionEngine is usable on a broadly diverse and accessible range of machines
  by a broad and diverse range of people.
- PHP 7.4 OR 8.2, running with PHP-FPM is recommended for the best experience.
- MySQL 5.6 or newer including MySQL 8 OR Percona 5.6 or newer is recommended.
- PHP 8.3 is fully supported, but there may be third-party add-ons that are not updated
  as rapidly as EE is.
- Once you are confident that ExpressionEngine is working normally on your server,
  we recommend a few best practices for protecting your installation against common
  security risks.
- ExpressionEngine’s system files and directories are typically safe from direct HTTP
  access on a properly configured server.
- For increased security, we recommend that the system folder either be renamed or
  moved entirely above the public web root folder.
- For increased security, rename the system folder or move it above the public web
  root.
- Rename admin.php to something less obvious.
- If using Multiple Site Manager, you can repeat the above steps for each site, assuming
  each site has its own web root.
- Some common problems include links returning 404s, a “No Input File Specified” error,
  or all links returning the same content.
- It is recommended that you always update your installation of ExpressionEngine when
  a new version is released to ensure that you have all bug fixes, security updates,
  and new features.
- Shortly after a major version is released, the previous major version will become
  a legacy product.
- This version includes important security updates.
- A channel is just data. There is no assumed association between this data and any
  particular page of your site.
- By default, ExpressionEngine will direct your visitor to the homepage when a 404
  error is encountered.
- It is recommended that you set up a custom 404 page for your site.
- ExpressionEngine has tools to make compliance with regulations like GDPR easy.
- This guide is for ExpressionEngine 3.2 and higher. Please update before following
  these directions.
- The <member_id> tag will cause the import utility to overwrite any existing members
  with the same ID. It is generally recommended that you do not use a <member_id>
  tag.
- Site builders can customize the display of the Publish Page on a per Channel basis
  by creating a custom layout.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Users can be banned by IP address, email, or name.
- Template names must be a single word with no spaces.
- Allow PHP parsing can be set to enable or disable.
- The 'system/user/language' folder must be writable to create translation files.
- CAPTCHA Settings — ExpressionEngine 7 Documentation
- 'Email can be sent by ExpressionEngine by one of three protocols: PHP Mail, Sendmail,
  or SMTP.'
- Our official recommendation is that users enable Strict URLs, as doing so makes
  the path to your content more precise, allows more relevant 404 pages, and does
  not allow your content to be shown with variances in the URL structure. However,
  for legacy reasons, Strict URLs are disabled by default.
- This section of the Control Panel allows you to manage the Throttling feature.
- Enabling the Dock controls whether ExpressionEngine Pro is turned on for the front-end
  of your website.
- Enabling front-end editing allows users with respective permissions to edit channel
  entries and content on the front-end of your website.
- By default ExpressionEngine Pro automatically inserts edit links where editable
  content is found in templates.
- Add Branding to your ExpressionEngine Install
- Recommendation is that the image is no more than 400px in width.
- 'Important: Enabling PHP in a template enables anyone with editing rights for that
  template to become a de-facto Super Admin since they can execute any PHP they want
  in that template, including PHP that can reveal information about your system, PHP
  that can delete data from your database, etc. Exercise extreme caution before enabling
  this option if you permit others to edit your templates.'
- 'Important: When upgrading from an earlier version of ExpressionEngine to v6, the
  allow_php config override will automatically be set to ‘y’ if templates already
  exists that have PHP enabled.'
- Optimization tips include caching and performance handling, throttling, and performance
  monitoring.
- Security tips include general tips, captchas, and spam protection.
- Troubleshooting resources available for general issues, installation, and error
  messages.
- By default, you cannot use embeds inside of Forum templates.
- You can nest embedded templates as deeply as you want.
- You can not put a template within itself or you’ll cause a run-away loop.
- You also can not put an 'upstream' template inside of a 'downstream' one.
- PHP settings for each Template are honored on a per-Template basis.
- A template is fully rendered before any embedded templates are processed and included.
- If you are using the Multiple Site Manager, you can embed templates from one site
  into another site.
- Custom, site-defined template variables can be created for use in any Template.
- Template variables can hold any static information.
- Consent variables are boolean values.
- Native Consent requests are prefixed with 'ee:'.
- Dates in ExpressionEngine are most often stored as integers, which translate to
  whole seconds.
- Template Routes overrides the default behavior of URLs
- Be careful when using dynamic="yes" with Template Routes, this can cause issues
  if your route does not have an appropriate segment set.
- If there is not enough content for more than one page, nothing will be output by
  these tags.
- Allows use of inline errors in forms using {errors} and {error:field_name}.
- The Channel Entries tag can display both multi-entry and single-entry content.
- The directives that tell the tag how to behave are parameters.
- Using this parameter will automatically cause ExpressionEngine to ignore any category
  information specified via the URL.
- These links can only be used on pages displaying a single entry, such as a 'comment'
  page, since they are designed to provide navigation from one entry to another.
- These tags cannot be placed inside your main Channel Entries Tag. They must be placed
  outside of the Channel Entries tag in order to work correctly.
- The view tracking counter works in conjunction with the {exp:channel:entries} tag.
- If you have page caching enabled this feature will not work.
- This feature will only work if page caching is turned OFF for the template in which
  it is being used.
- The csrf_token field is required to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
- If you have pagination links on your page they will not retain the dynamically generated
  values using this feature.
- Once you have hundreds of channel entries, it might become cumbersome to use this
  tag on your page.
- Allows guest (logged out) users to use the entry form, with optional CAPTCHA support.
- Server-side validation.
- The Date field allows for quick entry of dates via the publish form.
- Units can be set to Hours, Minutes or Seconds.
- Authors can input duration values using colon-notation.
- Only valid emails are allowed to be saved in this field.
- Your site must have at least one upload directory before you can create a file field.
- Conditional fields are not supported inside Fluid
- Only allow selecting member with chosen primary roles.
- Sets the number of members displayed in the field’s dropdown.
- When set to yes, authors will be allowed to create multiple relationships in a single
  field.
- Selectable Button fields allow publishers to choose either multiple or single items
  from a list depending on the setting.
- A member account’s Username and Screen Name can be identical, but the Username must
  be unique system-wide.
- In order for site visitors to be allowed to register for accounts via front-end
  forms the Allow Registrations must be set to allow registrations under Settings
  > Member Settings.
- Logging out deletes the session cookie, potentially logging someone out of the admin
  panel.
- This form will only email the user if the user requesting the password reset is
  not currently logged in.
- 'This parameter is for use with form validation and error handling and determines
  the type of error reporting: inline or error template.'
- Multi-factor authentication adds an extra level of protection to the Control Panel
  by relying on one-time password generated by Multi-factor authentication applications
  like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Authy.
- Do not enable Template Caching on any Template containing this tag if member_id
  parameter is omitted.
- Avoid using Template Caching on any Template containing this tag.
- The member profile area allows members to manage their profile information.
- The 'legacy_member_templates' config override must be set to use legacy templates.
- The Comment Entries Tag is intended for use in one of your “single entry” pages.
- The Comment Entries tag should not be nested inside of a standard {exp:channel:entries}
  tag.
- Avoid using Template Caching on any Template containing conditionals that are user-specific.
- This form should be placed on a single-entry type page such as a comments page.
- Utilizes template form validation and error handling.
- If enabled, the system will throttle excessive web requests from potentially malicious
  users.
- Use a dash (-) as the word separator (default)
- Only allow framing from the site itself (default)
- 2 letter ISO 639 language code (e.g. en, es, de)
- 'Must use # for comments within .env.php. Using // will result in your .env.php
  being unable to be read.'
- Require user consent to set cookies must be enabled before any restrictions on will
  take effect.
- Results are displayed on the page specified as the result_page
- ExpressionEngine does not search through existing comments and delete them when
  new items are added to the Block list.
- Downloading the ExpressionEngine.com Block and Allow List requires that your host
  have outgoing socket connections enabled on your server.
- The Email Module is not installed by default, so before using these tags make sure
  it is installed via the /cp/addons/index at Developer --> Add-Ons.
- Optimization and Security sections provide best practices for API usage.
- Used sparingly, the Pages Module is a very useful tool, but when overused it can
  create an unmaintainable site.
- Building the index or lexicon via the specified URL will not happen in batches.
- Defaults to Yes for encoded query
- Defaults to search/results for default result page
- Defaults to 500 for search log size
- Defaults to 100 for collection batch size
- Defaults to 50 for excerpt length
- Defaults to do not highlight for highlight keywords
- Defaults to 4 for minimum word length
- Use input fields if you want the value of the parameter to be user defined or logged
  to the Search Log.
- Use hard-coded parameters if you want the value to be fixed.
- You may only use SELECT statements; it will not process UPDATE or DELETE queries.
- Using template tags as part of your query is strongly discouraged.
- ExpressionEngine has the ability to serve only new content if it receives an RFC3229-compliant
  request.
- This module tracks system statistics.
- Uses CLI to create add-ons.
- Add-on must have an addon.setup.php file starting from version 3.0.
- The `upd` file is critical for add-on management in ExpressionEngine.
- Although ExpressionEngine is amazing, we do not suggest using the above example
  in production.
- Actions are not available for use until they have been added to the exp_actions
  database table.
- Setting your action to CSRF Exempt makes this endpoint less secure.
- To make your fieldtype recognized by Grid, modify `~EE_Fieldtype::accepts_content_type`
  to accept 'grid' content type.
- If a fieldtype does NOT implement `grid_display_field()`, Grid will call `display_field()`.
- The google maps fieldtype allows for customizable latitude, longitude, and zoom
  settings.
- Creating your own custom template tags allows you to display dynamic data from your
  add-on anywhere you want.
- Contains an array named $lang for displaying text in user-selected language
- Tab files are not currently able to be generated through the CLI, thus you will
  need to manually create the file `tab.[addon_name].php` in the root of your add-on’s
  folder.
- PHP widgets are installed when add-on is installed or updated.
- HTML add-on widgets are installed when add-on is installed or updated.
- Template widgets are installed when dashboard layout is updated.

  to be shown via the Comment Entries tag and manipulate it with your own `->where()`
  clauses.
