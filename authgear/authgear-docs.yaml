auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.authgear.com/customization/custom-ui/implement-authentication-flow-api-using-php:
  - The API uses a multi-step authentication flow where credentials are submitted
    via POST request body. The login request requires Content-Type and Accept headers
    set to application/json. User email and password are sent in the batch_input array
    with identification set to "email" and authentication set to "primary_password".
    The response contains a state_token and finish_redirect_uri that must be used
    to complete the authentication flow.
- information_source; https://docs.authgear.com/how-to-guide/custom-ui/authentication-flow-api:
  - The authentication flow uses a stateful token-based approach. Each request includes
    a state_token in the request body to maintain session state across multiple authentication
    steps. The state_token is obtained from the previous response and passed forward
    in subsequent requests along with authentication data (such as identification
    type, login_id, and authenticator credentials) in the input field.
- information_source; https://docs.authgear.com/reference/apis:
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) is used for authentication. The UserInfo endpoint
    at /oauth2/userinfo is a protected resource that requires a valid Access Token
    presented by the client. Configuration endpoints at /.well-known/openid-configuration
    and /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server provide authorization endpoint, token
    endpoint, and JWKs endpoint URLs. The Admin API at /_api/admin/graphql requires
    authentication (specific method not detailed in this excerpt).
  - The resolver endpoint at `/_resolver/resolve` checks access tokens or cookies
    in request headers and adds `x-authgear-` headers to the response. The exact authentication
    mechanism and required header/parameter names are not specified in this excerpt;
    refer to the linked specs at https://github.com/authgear/authgear-server/blob/master/docs/specs/api-resolver.md
    for complete auth details.
- information_source; https://docs.authgear.com/reference/apis/authentication-flow-api:
  - State tokens are used to track and continue authentication flows. After each successful
    API response, a state_token is returned in the result object and must be included
    in the body of subsequent requests to the /api/v1/authentication_flows/states/input
    endpoint to progress through the authentication flow. The state token is passed
    as a JSON field named "state_token" in the request body along with the required
    input data for each step.
