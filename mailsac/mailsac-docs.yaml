auth_info:
- information_source; https://blog.mailsac.com/authentication-changes/:
  - 'Mailsac API requires authentication on all routes using an API key that can be
    created from the dashboard. Three authentication methods are supported: HTTP header
    `Mailsac-Key` with the API key value, query string parameter `_mailsacKey` appended
    to the URL, or JSON request body field `_mailsacKey` during POST or PUT operations.'
- information_source; https://blog.mailsac.com/category/api/:
  - Mailsac API requires authentication using an API key that can be created from
    the dashboard. The key can be sent via HTTP header named Mailsac-Key, query string
    parameter named _mailsacKey, or JSON request body field named _mailsacKey. All
    API routes now require authentication; existing customers with API keys need no
    changes, but new users must create an account and generate an API key.
  - The Mailsac API requires a Mailsac API Key for authentication. The API key must
    be obtained from https://mailsac.com/api-keys (requires free sign up). In the
    Swagger UI Explorer, use the Authorize button to enter your API key. The documentation
    indicates the API key should be provided when making requests, though the exact
    header name or parameter name is not explicitly stated in this excerpt.
  - The Mailsac API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the `Mailsac-Key`
    header with each request. The API key must be inserted in place of `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
    and is required to access endpoints like `/api/addresses/:email/messages` and
    `/api/messages/:messageId/headers`.

  - Mailsac API uses API key authentication. Obtain a free API key from https://mailsac.com/api-keys
    (requires sign up), then enter it in the Authorize button within the Swagger UI
    Explorer at https://mailsac.com/docs/swagger/. The API key is used to authenticate
    requests to the REST API endpoints.
