notes:
- Whenever the chatbox becomes minimized, the given callback function will be triggered.
- If you are trying to track when visitors shrink the Olark widget, to perhaps track
  via analytics the efficacy of different auto-messaging rules, you can use this following
  example to do so.
- You can notify your operator that the visitor has minimized the widget if you have
  already started chatting.
- Keep track of a full name for this visitor, to link it with your CRM cases and display
  in the buddy list.
- Instead of having the Olark chat window fixed to the bottom corner of your page,
  Olark will instead search your page for an element with the ID `olark-box-container`
  and load the chatbox there instead.
- You can only set a ‘snippet’ of the status, since other extensions may be trying
  to update the status at the same time.
- Whenever the chatbox is hidden, the given callback function will be triggered.
- You can notify your operator that the visitor has closed the chatbox if you have
  already started chatting.
- Whenever a message is sent to the operator, this will call the given `callback`
  with an `event` object.
- Use your favorite analytics system to keep track of visitors who have sent a message
  to an operator (since they might be more valuable).
- Maybe you want to keep track of positive vs. negative reactions. You could watch
  when people send you smileys, indicating that they are happy.
- Downgrading your account may result in the loss of content, features, or capacity
  of your account.
- Olark does not accept any liability for any such losses.
- This method requires a plan that supports the Groups feature.
- This script may not work well without routing to ALL operators enabled in the Setup
  page.
- Require visitors fill out their email address in the pre-chat survey before chatting.
  This requires the pre-chat survey to be enabled first.
- This setting can also be enabled on the pre-chat survey section of the Text & Forms
  settings page.
- Sets the Attention Grabber image while your operators are set to available.
- Like the other Attention Grabber calls, this works on a page by page basis.
- When an offline message is sent to the operator, this will call the given callback
  with an event object
- Keep track of an email address for this visitor, to link it with your CRM cases
  and display in the visitor list.
- Dynamically add questions to your prechat survey with ‘system.custom_prechat’. Pass
  an array of the questions you’d like to add using the format below.
- This requires the pre-chat survey to be enabled first.
- We’ll do our best to help with any questions you have. However, please keep in mind
  that the API is intended to be self-serve for web developers, so we’re not able
  to write or debug your code.
- If you have questions about our retention periods, please contact us.
- If you believe we have violated your privacy rights, you have a right to lodge a
  complaint about our data handling practices.
- Whenever a command is sent from the visitor, e.g. *!track this is a lead*, this
  will call the given `callback` with an `event` object.
- Commands must begin with an exclamation point *!* and come at the start of a message.
- To see the list of commands you can perform, type `!help` into a chat at any time.
- You can change the language of the chatbox per page by using the following configuration
  call.
- If you want to change the language of the chatbox site wide you can do so from your
  Text & Forms settings.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Sets the Attention Grabber image while all your operators are set to away or offline.
- Custom fields are not sent automatically to CRM integrations.
- Custom fields will, however, be sent with Webhooks by default.
- Whenever the chatbox is expanded, the given callback function will be triggered.
- A visitor to your site might expand the chatbox, but not initiate a conversation.
  You can check to see if a conversation has started and if not, send the visitor
  a message after 3 seconds.
- If you are trying to track when visitors interact with the Olark widget, to perhaps
  test out different methods of presenting the widget, you can use this following
  example to do so.
- Webhook sends JSON-encoded transcript when a conversation completes
- Extra events can be enabled on the integration page
- Suppose you usually show the chatbox, but wish to hide it on specific pages.
- You can enable this option on your Setup page as Hide the chatbox by default.
- The api.box.hide function is useful for when the chatbox has already loaded on a
  site and you wish to hide it again.
- If you used api.box.hide to hide the chatbox when the page loads, a visitor might
  see the chatbox appear briefly, before the API call was read.
- Set the group before the chatbox loads.
- You can get the ID for each group by clicking on it from the Operator settings page.
- This differs from the setOperatorGroup API call in that it can only be done before
  the chatbox loads.
- Set the primary color of the chatbox. This can also be changed site wide from the
  Theme Settings Page.
- This configure call will only accept a hex string.
- Normally, the chatbox is anchored to the bottom of the webpage. This detaches the
  chatbox from the bottom of the page, allowing it to float near the bottom instead.
- Whenever any operator comes online, the given callback will be triggered.
- This call will only fire if an operator’s state changes. It cannot be queried.
- Send a notification message to the operator. The operator will see *[info]* to indicate
  that this message was not sent from the visitor.
- Require visitors fill out their name in the pre-chat survey before chatting. This
  requires the pre-chat survey to be enabled first.
- Change the color of your visitor messages. This configuration key will only accept
  hex values.
- Enables the Attention Grabber slide-out animation.
- If you’d like to reach out to people on your checkout page to ensure you make the
  sale, or offer a discount, you might wish to animate the Attention Grabber on that
  page only, to give it extra prominence.
- We have two options that allow you to have ‘soft’ or ‘hard’ corners for the chatbox.
  By default the chatbox will have soft corners.
- Use this API call to detect when the Olark chatbox has loaded.
- You can create your own callback function once the onReady event fires.
- Choose what font you’d like the chatbox to have. Use this call with an Array of
  valid loaded fonts. Note that the fonts must be loaded on your site for the chatbox
  to be able to use them.
- Send a message to the visitor. It will appear as if the message came from an operator.
- Uses system.localization for language settings.
- Normally the chatbox shows an icon in the top right corner that, when clicked, allows
  the user to minimize it.
- This configuration option allows you to remove that button so that, once the chatbox
  has been expanded, the user can not manually minimize it.
- However, the chatbox can still be minimized and expanded with api calls.
- Expands the chatbox to its fully expanded height.
- Overrides any existing Targeted Chat rules that may hide the chatbox.
- Hides the chatbox. This box will make the chatbox disappear on the page, but operators
  will still be able to see visitors in their visitor list.
- You might want Olark to be loaded in the background on a particular page, but not
  show immediately.
- If you have a link in your chatbox that goes to a non-local URL, for example a page
  on another domain, Olark will by default wrap the new page.
- However, increasingly websites are not allowing cross-domain access, meaning that
  the wrapped content may not work correctly.
- You can choose to disable this wrapping behavior by setting this API call to true.
- Note that by enabling this setting, visitors who click the link to the non-local
  URL will leave your website and no longer be able to chat with you.
- 'As an alternative, you can prepend any link you type into the chatbox with a +
  symbol (eg. Click here to upload an image: +imgur.com), which will force the link
  to open in a new tab/window.'
- On your Text & Forms settings page, you can add a target='_blank' attribute to a
  link to make it open in a new tab/window.
- Use this API call to enable the Google Analytics integration on a single page.
- You can also enable this in your Google Analytics Extension settings.
- Gets the email address, full name, geolocation, and other details for this visitor.
- The value will be returned to the specified returnCallback.
- Geolocation information is provided to the best of our knowledge, based on the visitor’s
  IP.
- As part of our effort to remove personally identifiable information from our API,
  this call no longer provides access to the visitor’s IP address.
- Set the Google Analytics ID for your account on a specific page.
- For example, you might have separate domains using the same Olark account, but different
  Google Analytics IDs.
- Default localization strings will be used unless overridden by specific configuration
  calls.
- You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority
  situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of
  alleged infringement.
- 'Change the size of the chatbox. The chatbox can be configured to appear in one
  of three different sizes: small, medium, or large. By default, it uses the medium
  size.'
- Changing the size of the chatbox will also modify the size of the chat button.
- Olark is web-based, so it will run on any modern computer with a supported web browser.
- All data that is collected is stored in an encrypted format.
- Whenever all operators are offline, the given callback will be triggered.
- You can create Targeted Chat rules without any coding on the Targeted Chat settings
  page.
- Whenever a visitor or operator sends the first message, the given callback function
  will be triggered.
- While we encourage you to be as human as possible during your interactions, and
  avoiding as much canned copy as you can, we do recognize the fact that sometimes
  something comes up and you cannot answer a visitor’s chat right away.
- Shows the chatbox. Showing the chatbox will make it appear on the page. This will
  override settings such as *Invisible Olark*.
- If a visitor runs into an error, you might want to make sure that the chatbox is
  displayed.
- updateVisitorNickname is best used to display visitor information other than name
  and email in the buddy list.
- You can only set a ‘snippet’ of the nickname, since other extensions may be trying
  to update the nickname at the same time.
- Set the Attention Grabber image height in pixels.
- This only works if you either, have the Attention Grabber switched on in the Attention
  Grabber settings, or are using the API call to Enable the Attention Grabber.
- Require visitors fill out their phone number in the pre-chat survey before chatting.
  This requires the pre-chat survey to be enabled first.
- Even if the pre-chat survey is enabled in your settings, you would need to enable
  the plugin using the line `olark.configure("features.prechat_survey", true);` to
  use the system.ask_for_phone API call.
- Set the Attention Grabber image width in pixels.
- Keep track of a phone number for this visitor, to link it with your transcripts
  and display in the visitor list.
- Whenever a message is sent to the visitor, this will call the given callback with
  an event object.
- Use your favorite analytics system to keep track of how long it takes an operator
  to respond to a visitor.
- Whenever the chatbox is shown (unhidden), the given callback function will be triggered.
- If you have chosen to have your chatbox hidden by default, you can indicate in your
  buddy list that a visitor can now see the chatbox.
- You can enable the Attention Grabber on a page by page basis using this API call.
