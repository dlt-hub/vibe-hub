notes:
- Token does not expire
- This patch release addresses an issue affecting the Comments functionality when
  using Oracle databases.
- If after the upgrade there are still images missing from reports then the workaround
  is to remove the image and add it again.
- Canopy uses a number of terms which should be familiar to most users.
- Deleting findings is not typically recommended.
- Only one group can be created at a time.
- It is not mandatory to follow the PR/QA process. However, it is recommended in most
  scenarios.
- Templates for emails sent for various report statuses and project phase notifications.
- Project access controls are still authoritative.
- None of the export options will export the Methodologies associated with the phase.
- Users require edit permissions on template reports to be able to export them.
- Users require edit permissions on template reports to be able to import them.
- The reports interface has been redesigned in Canopy 3.9.0.
- 'Canopy supports separation of the following modules on separate servers: Web server,
  Application server, Database server, Report server.'
- Some Canopy settings can be exported and imported via the experimental Data Import/Export
  feature accessible via the Canopy admin interface.
- Separate Portal user accounts should be created for clients.
- Canopy’s services should be restarted if any settings in that file are changed or
  if the database is restarted.
- File locations are for Ubuntu and might be slightly different for RHEL based distributions.
- The EXTERNAL_BASE_URL is used as the prefix for any links sent out via email.
- Canopy uses systemd to manage its processes and it requires environment variables
  to be set in the systemd service override files for both the canopy and canopy-celery
  services when operating behind a proxy.
- Only the desktop version of Microsoft Word is supported at this time.
- You may need to enable compatibility mode for the add-on to function correctly.
- The email attribute (via a claim mapping) is required for both flows.
- Session timeout should be aligned with the access token lifetime.
- OIDC_ENABLE=true
- OIDC_FETCH_USERINFO=true
- OIDC_MERGE_ALL_CLAIMS=true
- Our Backups and recovery guide is the most robust method for backup and restoration.
- This guide is very similar but uses a different DB backup method, which is known
  to be problematic in certain scenarios.
- Login can be SP initiated or IdP initiated.
- Canopy requires that the email field is mapped to a SAML attribute that contains
  the users email address and the name field is mapped to the user’s name/surname
  attribute.
- OAuth may not be possible on certain instances due to incompatibilities between
  the Jira version and the client library in use.
- Basic auth using API tokens may be easier in such cases.
- Canopy can only be supported under certain conditions.
- Deployments on AWS are possible and have been tested using the Amazon and Canonical
  supported AMIs.
- This feature is still experimental. It and its data formats are subject change.
- AD authentication related settings are configured in /etc/canopy/canopy.ini and
  requires Canopy to be restarted after modification.
- 'Plugins (Python files) must be copied to the following plugin path and must be
  readable by the `canopy` user: /var/opt/checksec/canopy/plugins'
- 'Management commands (Python files) must be copied to the following management command
  path and must be readable by the `canopy` user: /var/opt/checksec/canopy/commands'
- All files under /var/opt/checksec/canopy needs to be owned by the `canopy` user
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
