auth_info:
- information_source; https://v8lpkwzgbl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/swagger.json:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Use either a user or admin API key sent as
    a bearer token in the Authorization header. The endpoint expects the header format
    "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}" and will return a 401 error if the authentication
    header is missing.'
  - API keys are required for authentication. Admin operations require an admin API
    key sent via an authentication header, while user operations accept either a user
    or admin API key. The API supports both permanent and trial (30-day) API keys.
  - Authentication requires a valid admin API key. The security scheme is named "admin_api_key"
    and must be provided to access user endpoints. A 401 response indicates a missing
    authentication header. The exact header name and transmission method are not specified
    in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'The API uses API key authentication with two roles: user_api_key and admin_api_key.
    API keys must be sent in the Authentication header; user_api_key grants read access
    to quotes while admin_api_key grants read, update, and delete permissions. Missing
    the authentication header returns a 401 error.'
  - The API uses admin API key authentication for protected endpoints. Send the admin
    API key via the `admin_api_key` security scheme (typically in the `Authorization`
    header). Endpoints like token revocation and user listing require this valid admin
    API key; requests without proper authentication return a 401 error.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://v8lpkwzgbl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/swagger.json:
  - Page-based pagination is used with query parameters page (default 1) and per_page
    (default 5). Response includes a meta field (MetadataSchema) that provides pagination
    metadata. Use the page parameter to navigate through results, incrementing it
    to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 1) and per_page (default 5) to
    request specific pages. The response includes a meta object with pagination details
    to navigate between pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 1) and per_page (default 5), both
    integers. Response includes a meta field (referenced as MetadataSchema) and records
    array containing paginated results.
  - The API uses per_page query parameter (optional, default 5, integer type) to control
    results per page. The response includes a meta field (via MetadataSchema reference)
    alongside records array, though the full pagination navigation fields are not
    shown in this excerpt.
