- Cache helps reduce the number of requests made to the original data source for schema
  information
- Supports Direct, Agent, and Agent with Alias connection modes
- Agent mode requires Agent application installation on computer with Internet access
  and database server access
- Data is securely transmitted between Agent and Skyvia in encrypted form

  automatically
- Can automatically create foreign keys corresponding to relations between cloud objects
- Foreign keys are not created for polymorphic relations
- Replaces characters not allowed in table names with underscores
- Truncates long table names and adds hash to ensure uniqueness
- Replication doesn't detect metadata changes in the source
- If a new field is added in a replicated object, it won't be replicated
- If a replicated field or object is deleted or renamed, replication will start failing
- Replication task editing is available for Amazon Redshift
- Part of data integration replication functionality
- Replication offers dynamic, continuous, incremental delivery of high volumes of
  data with very low latency
- Incremental updates are not supported for some objects in certain cloud apps
- Some databases may not support uppercase characters in table names or can be configured
  to always use lowercase table names
- When replicating data Amazon Redshift, replication task editor provides more settings
  for configuring target Redshift table and column parameters
- Log-Based mode is currently available for SQL Server only
- New and New and modified modes do not track deleted records
- Incremental updates require objects to have fields storing record creation and modification
  timestamps

- Primary key columns of database tables must be autogenerated
- Synchronized cloud objects must have fields storing creation and last modified timestamps
- Some cloud applications like Podio or SendPulse cannot be synchronized as they lack
  required timestamp fields
- Source data changes have priority over target data changes in case of conflicts
- Dedicated CRM account for synchronization is recommended to ignore changes made
  by the sync user
- DateTime format, number format, string collation, currency format determined by
  Locale setting
- If Locale not set, InvariantCulture is used
- Data flow parameters are not the same as action parameters
- Parameters allow storing values between data flow executions
- Variables are used to store values during data flow execution
- Parameters automatically create variables with the same name
- This appears to be a table of contents or navigation structure for a data integration
  platform documentation

  control flow
- Settings like parameters, variables, connections are shared between control flow
  and its data flows
- Execute Integration component fails only on integration-level errors, not data-level
  errors
- Native filters are supported by some Source APIs for specific fields and operations
- If Source API doesn't support native filter, data is written to cache and filter
  applied locally
- Cached filters consume extra API calls and take additional time
- CSV files don't support filters
- Relative filters may involve cache if Source API doesn't support native filter for
  a field
- Time intervals are counted for every selected day independently, and each day the
  schedule starts at 00:00 afresh
- If you do not specify the exact period, next day integration will start running
  on 00:00 automatically
- Time Zone is a required parameter that is used to define the time zone your schedule
  is based on
- Exported CSV files are stored for 7 days, then deleted
- Error and success logs may be stored for a longer time but are eventually deleted

  chosen connection
- If one of the webhook parameters is null, Skyvia will determine its data type as
  string
- Execute Command always returns an array
- Insert action always returns an object
- Components that are disabled also disable access to their output
- Data in inner scope (Foreach and Try/Catch) is not available to components that
  follow them
- Can access first element of single-item array without Foreach using dot notation
- Connection triggers require valid connections to avoid error messages and email
  notifications
- Queued executions have a lifespan of 60 days
- Disabled or skipped components do not interact with data and cannot be debugged
  for Input/Output values
- In Foreach loops, Input and Output values shown are from the last iteration
