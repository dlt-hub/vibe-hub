auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.beeceptor.com/mock-server/json-placeholder:
  - The API uses JWT token-based authentication. Users log in via POST /login with
    username and password in the JSON request body, receiving a JWT token in the response
    on successful authentication (200 status). Failed login attempts (401 status)
    return an error with code "invalid_credentials". The JWT token should be used
    in subsequent requests, typically in the Authorization header as a bearer token.
- information_source; https://beeceptor.com/docs/http-callout-with-mock/:
  - 'Stripe uses Bearer token authentication with the Authorization header. Include
    the header `Authorization: Bearer <STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>` where STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
    is your Stripe secret API key. Credentials are sent in the Authorization header
    of the HTTP request.'
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" when making HTTP requests to the CRM
    endpoint.'
  - The documentation shows an API key authentication mechanism. The API key must
    be passed as a query parameter named appid in the request URL (e.g., GET /data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=<API_KEY>).
    Replace <API_KEY> with your actual API key value from OpenWeatherMap.
- information_source; https://beeceptor.com/docs/api-overview/:
  - 'To authenticate each request, set the `Authorization` header with a valid API
    key in the format `Authorization: <api_key>`. Each API key is bound to a single
    Beeceptor endpoint, and an active Team plan or above is required for API access.
    API keys can be created and managed under account management, and should be kept
    secure.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://beeceptor.com/docs/concepts/rest-api-interview-questions/:
  - Pagination in REST APIs is handled using query parameters like limit to control
    the number of items returned per page and offset or page to specify which chunk
    of data to retrieve. The response typically includes metadata indicating the total
    count, current page, or a next link to facilitate navigation through paginated
    results.
  - 'Pagination supports two approaches: Approach 1 uses query parameters `page` (page
    index) and `limit` (items per page), where page=2&limit=10 retrieves records 11-20.
    Approach 2 uses `offset` (starting position) and `limit` parameters, where offset=10&limit=10
    also retrieves records 11-20.'
