- Routing decision is based on AI analysis of the inquiry
- AI Knowledge functions as a RAG-as-a-Service offering.
- The Test-Driven Building approach ensures your agent maintains high performance
  over time.
- AI Knowledge is designed to be model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility across various
  LLMs for both embedding and generative tasks.
- A maximum document quota is often enforced on your instance. Please contact your
  internal point of contact to request an increase of this limit.
- Ensure to set up authentication if required during crawling configuration.
- Regularly recrawl your website to keep chatbot knowledge current.
- Uses basic authentication with encoded credentials
- Ensure confidentiality by setting the automation to private
- Prisme.ai acts as a processor, not an owner of your information.
- Privacy protection is built into our platform architecture, not added as an afterthought.
- 'Implement MFA: Always use multi-factor authentication with SSO'

- Prisme.ai supports deployment in both cloud and self-hosted environments.
- Offers both no-code/low-code and programming options for integration.
- If issues persist, try uploading a simpler version of the document or contact support
  for assistance.
- Prisme.ai supports both cloud and self-hosted deployment models.
- 'Check Document Status: If status is ''Error'', check the specific error message
  for details.'
- Some document formats may cause processing problems.
- For scanned PDFs, enable OCR in the project settings.
- SSO integration may require verification of settings with IT department
