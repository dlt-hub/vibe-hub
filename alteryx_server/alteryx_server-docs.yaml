auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.alteryx.com/aac/en/release-notes/release-notes-for-alteryx-one.html:
  - Account members can generate OAuth 2.0 API tokens via the Alteryx One API to access
    account services. Tokens are created through the OAuth 2.0 API Tokens Page for
    Users, and OAuth 2.0 authentication is also supported for REST API Connections.
  - OAuth 2.0 API tokens are now enabled by default in newly created workspaces for
    generating and managing personal access tokens via the OAuth 2.0 API Access page.
    Exact authentication scheme details, header names, token endpoint URLs, scopes,
    and client credential requirements are not provided in this documentation excerpt.
- ? information_source; https://help.alteryx.com/aac/en/platform/connections/configure-connectivity/enable-oauth-2-0-authentication/oauth-2-0-for-box.html
  : - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required for Box integration in Alteryx One. Register
      an OAuth 2.0 client with Type set to box, providing the Client ID and Client
      Secret from your Box app setup. Use authorization URL https://account.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize
      and token URL https://api.box.com/oauth2/token. Set the scope to root_readwrite,
      with access token expiration of 3600000 ms and refresh token expiration of 0
      ms.
- ? information_source; https://help.alteryx.com/aac/en/platform/connections/configure-connectivity/enable-oauth-2-0-authentication/oauth-2-0-for-google-analytics.html
  : - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. You must create OAuth 2.0 credentials
      with Client ID and Client Secret from Google Cloud Console, then configure the
      authorized redirect URI as https://ayxpreview.alteryxcloud.com/oauth2/callback.
      These credentials are applied in Alteryx One to authenticate with Google Analytics
      APIs.
- ? information_source; https://help.alteryx.com/aac/en/platform/connections/configure-connectivity/enable-oauth-2-0-authentication/oauth-2-0-for-hubspot.html
  : - HubSpot uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. The authorization endpoint is https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/authorize,
      the token endpoint is https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token, access tokens expire
      in 1800000 milliseconds, and refresh tokens do not expire (set to 0). You must
      provide required scopes when configuring the OAuth 2.0 client.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://help.alteryx.com/aac/en/platform/connections/supported-connection-types/rest-api-connections.html
  : - Pagination uses the nextPageURL method. The response contains a nextPageURL
      field that provides the URL for the next page of results; continue requesting
      until no nextPageURL is returned.
    - 'The API supports four pagination methods: None (no pagination), Next page URL
      (URL of next page returned in response body with configurable XPath), Paging
      token (token returned in response and submitted in subsequent request via configurable
      parameter), Record offset (query parameters for offset and page size), and Page
      number (query parameters for page number and page size). Each method requires
      specific configuration of parameter names and response field paths.'
    - Use the next_url field from the response (accessed via JSON path $.next_url)
      to retrieve subsequent pages. The pagination type is nextPageURL, meaning each
      response contains a direct URL to the next page that should be used for the
      following request.
