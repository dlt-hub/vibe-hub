auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/:
  - Authentication for the TMS API uses an authentication token. Requests must include
    the token in the Authorization header as a bearer token to authenticate API calls.
    Refer to the Authentication Token documentation section for specific token acquisition
    and usage details.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/overview/Setup/:
  - Each environment has a unique authentication token provided by the service. The
    token must be kept secure, shared only with trusted team members, never included
    in emails or exposed in sample code, and reported immediately to the support team
    if compromised so it can be blocked and replaced.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/overview/Authentication_Token/:
  - All TMS REST API requests require authentication via an API token passed in the
    X-AUTH-TOKEN header. Each token is 32 characters long and generated by TMS. Multiple
    tokens can be active simultaneously for a single API user. All requests must use
    HTTPS.
  - Authentication to the GovDelivery TMS API requires an authentication token. The
    token must be sent as a query parameter named `token` with each API request. Obtain
    the token through the Setup process documented in the API overview before making
    any API calls.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/tutorial/hello_world_keyword/:
  - Authentication uses a secret token passed as the X-AUTH-TOKEN header in requests.
    The token is provided when initializing the client and must be included in all
    API calls to the GovDelivery TMS service.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/resource/webhooks/:
  - Responses with more than 50 records are paginated to 50 records per response.
    Pagination uses Link header with rel="first", "last", "prev", and "next" relations
    containing page query parameters to navigate between pages.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/resource/inbound/sms/--id--/command_actions/:
  - Results with more than 50 records are paginated to 50 records per response by
    default. Pagination uses a Link header with rel="first", "last", "prev", and "next"
    relations containing page query parameters to navigate between pages.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/tms.raml:
  - The API uses Link header pagination with page query parameter. The Link header
    contains rel="last" to indicate the final page URL (e.g., /webhooks?page=5). Construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter value.
- information_source; https://developers.govdelivery.com/api/tms/tms.json:
  - Pagination uses Link header with rel="first", "last", "prev", and "next" relations
    containing page query parameters to navigate between pages. Stop paginating when
    no "next" relation is present in the Link header.
