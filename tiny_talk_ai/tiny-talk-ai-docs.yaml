notes:
- API is exclusively available to users on our paid plan
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Tiny Talk only supports subdomains (e.g. chat.example.com), not the naked domain
  (like example.com).
- Certain plans come with 1 free custom domain. Others require purchasing custom domains
  add-on separately.
- Be cautious when using the Delete Bot feature, as it cannot be undone.
- You may contact us by email at support at tinytalk.ai
- The Services are provided on an AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE basis.
