auth_info:
- information_source; https://multitradesoftech.com/mtsrestapidocs.html:
  - ApiKeyAuth scheme. Send credentials in the Authorization header as "API_KEY:REQUEST_TOKEN"
    where API_KEY and REQUEST_TOKEN are your authentication credentials. Also include
    Api-Version header (default value 3).
  - Authentication uses an API key and request token sent in the Authorization header.
    The Authorization header must be formatted as "API_KEY:REQUEST_TOKEN" where API_KEY
    and REQUEST_TOKEN are your credentials. Additionally, the Api-Version header is
    required and should be set to "3".
  - The API uses ApiKeyAuth for authorization. Authentication is required via an API
    key, which should be sent in the request headers. The exact header name and how
    to provide the API key value are not explicitly specified in the provided documentation
    excerpt.
  - The API uses a combination of two forms of authentication. A 401 status code indicates
    an invalid AccessToken, suggesting token-based authentication is required. However,
    the documentation does not specify the exact header names, parameter names, token
    format, or how to obtain/refresh tokens. Additional details on the authentication
    mechanisms are needed to provide complete implementation guidance.
  - The MTS API uses a two-step authentication process. First, send api_key and api_secrets
    as form-encoded POST data to the login endpoint at https://wss1.multitrade.tech:15207/connect/login
    with Api-Version header set to "3". The response returns a request token. Then,
    use this token in the Authorization header with format "API_KEY:REQUEST_TOKEN"
    for subsequent API requests.
