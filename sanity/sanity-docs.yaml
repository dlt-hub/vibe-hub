  - 'API requests are authenticated using Bearer tokens included in the Authorization
    header. Include your API key as Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY, where YOUR_API_KEY
    is obtained from your workspace settings.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`. The API key can be found in your
    workspace settings. A 401 response indicates an authentication error.'
- information_source; https://docs.airops.com/building-workflows/workflow-steps/integrations/sanity:
  - Sanity uses API key authentication. Generate an API token from your Sanity.io
    project dashboard with Editor permissions, then pass it to AirOps via the Integrations
    settings. The API key provides REST API access to your Sanity instance and must
    be stored securely in server-side or authenticated environments only.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.airops.com/building-workflows/workflow-steps/integrations/sanity:
  - The List Resources function uses cursor-based pagination where you pass the Last
    ID parameter (optional) from the previous request to retrieve the next set of
    records. Each response returns 100 records per page, and you continue paginating
    by setting Last ID to the last ID from the previous response.
