auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.anaconda.com/docs/psm/on-prem/latest/admin/cve:
  - Your license is extracted from the license and used to authenticate to the CVE
    endpoint. The license serves as the authentication credential required to mirror
    from api.anaconda.cloud; without it, mirroring is not possible.
- information_source; https://www.anaconda.com/docs/reference/api/managing-your-organization-using-the-anaconda-cloud-api:
  - Service accounts use client credentials (client_id and client_secret) for authentication.
    When creating a service account via POST to /organizations/<ORG_ID>/service-accounts
    with a name in the request body, the API returns a client_id and client_secret
    that should be used for subsequent API calls to authenticate on behalf of that
    service account.
