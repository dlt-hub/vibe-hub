auth_info:
- information_source; https://altcha.org/docs/v2/migration/turnstile/:
  - Import the ALTCHA widget and include it in your form with a challengeurl parameter
    that requires your API key. On the backend, verify the Base64-encoded payload
    received from the widget using the altcha-lib library with your API key secret
    (prefixed with "sec_"), or alternatively use the POST /v1/verify/signature endpoint
    for verification.
- information_source; https://altcha.org/docs/v2/server-integration:
  - The POST /v1/verify/signature endpoint is public and does not require authentication.
    Requests should be sent with Content-Type application/json header and a JSON body
    containing the payload field to verify.
- information_source; https://altcha.org/docs/v2/migration/recaptcha:
  - The payload verification requires an API key secret obtained from your Sentinel
    App. Pass the Base64-encoded payload and the secret (formatted as "sec_...") to
    the verifyServerSignature function, or use the POST /v1/verify/signature endpoint
    with these credentials for server-side verification.
- information_source; https://altcha.org/docs/v2/migration/hcaptcha:
  - 'The secret key used for server-side verification is provided as an API key secret
    from your Sentinel App, passed as the `apiKeySecret` parameter (format: "sec_...")
    to the verification function. This secret is used to verify the Base64-encoded
    payload received from the widget.'
- information_source; https://altcha.org/docs/v2/migration/turnstile:
  - ALTCHA uses an API key-based authentication scheme. The API key is passed as a
    query parameter in the challengeurl (challengeurl="https://sentinel.example.com/v1/challenge?apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY}"),
    and server-side verification requires an API key secret (prefixed with "sec_")
    that is used with the verifyServerSignature function to verify the Base64-encoded
    payload received from the widget in the request body under the "altcha" field.
