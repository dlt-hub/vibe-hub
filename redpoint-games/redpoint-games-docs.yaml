notes:
- EOS SDK 1.17.1.3 and EOS SDK 1.18.0.4 are impacted by a regression that prevents
  games from querying game profiles of Steam friends if game profiles of Epic Games
  friends have previously been queried.
- If you don't link your client correctly, you won't be able to use the Developer
  Authentication Tool.
- The C++ APIs described in this section are only available in the Paid Edition, as
  the Free Edition does not ship with any C++ headers.
- Running game server containers requires additional setup.
- You need a dedicated server provisioned with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server.
- Support is only available to developers who have purchased EOS Online Framework
  on Fab.
- This release should be considered a beta release.
- While authentication works on Meta Quest, friend and invite functionality has not
  yet been reimplemented.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Free Edition users must upgrade to EOS SDK 1.15 for desktop builds.
- Free Edition users must now be on Unreal Engine 5.0.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in EOS
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Cross-platform party invites now work in NoEAS and EASOptional authentication modes.
- The plugin now supports all Epic Online Services APIs.
- Some plugin features require you to enable client policies that aren't enabled by
  default. If you run into permission denied errors in the Output Log when trying
  to use certain features, change the client policy type to Custom and turn on the
  features you need.
- Your packaged game will display the startup screen while the user is signed into
  Epic Online Services, before your game's configured 'Startup Map' is loaded.
- You should keep 'login before play-in-editor' enabled while testing in the editor.
- There are known issues in Epic's implementation of Steam in Unreal Engine.
- Steam authentication only works in packaged builds (not in the editor).
- Only the avatar for the locally signed in player can be fetched. Avatars for other
  itch.io players can not be retrieved, as itch.io does not provide an API for this.
- Discord integration is not available in the Free Edition
- Extract the Discord Social SDK into (Project Directory)\Plugins\DiscordSocialSdk-1.3.9273
- You must add the argument to your project launch settings in order for authentication
  to work as intended.
- Meta no longer supports Oculus Rift, and authenticating with Meta accounts on Oculus
  Rift is no longer supported.
- Support for destinations is currently experimental.
- Configuring Google authentication is particularly complex, and unfortunately if
  you make a mistake here, authentication will silently fail with very little information
  as to the cause of the error.
- Google Play requires that the target SDK version is 31 or higher.
- If you attempt to use voice chat on iOS without setting AdditionalPlistData to include
  the microphone usage description, the game will crash.
- You will only be able to use Epic Games sign in internally until your application
  goes through Brand Review.
- Apply for Brand Review weeks ahead of your game's release.
- VR games will need to bind to these events, and attach the widgets to the actors
  in the scene. Otherwise, your players will not be able to interact with the login
  prompts.
- You must associate your EOS client with an Epic Games application in the Developer
  Portal in order for developer authentication to work.
- If your application has not yet been approved via Brand Review, then you must add
  the accounts you want to test with to your organisation in the Developer Portal.
- Writing long sections of asynchronous code in C++ is tricky; we don't have the benefits
  of `async`/`await` yet, so often it becomes long chains of callbacks and state which
  are hard to manage and customize.
- Users will have to interactively sign in even on platforms like Steam.
- The user must sign into a cross-platform account before linking.
- Unused credentials will be associated with the cross-platform account after the
  interactive sign in.
- Local platform friends are not cached into Player Data Storage on console platforms,
  nor are cached friends from other platforms displayed on console platforms.
- Most platforms can advertise either a session or party via presence, but not both.
- You must have completed the 'Platform Setup' page in its entirety for the platforms
  you're publishing on.
- Automatically manages player registration for sessions
- Widget binding eliminates manual synchronisation code for friend lists.
- The plugin will automatically keep the player list in sync.
- You will only be able to retrieve presence information from Epic Games friends who
  are also currently playing your game.
- To enable Join and Invite functionality in the Epic Games Overlay for parties, make
  sure you set the PresenceAdvertises setting to Party.
- This is the default behaviour, so in most cases you don't need to explicitly set
  this option.
- Only one session can be set as the presence session.
- Only client IDs with the 'Game Server' role have permission to create sessions.
- The implementation described for player registration is not fault tolerant.
- Register an event handler for NetworkError to handle connection failures.
- The EOS session backend only supports a subset of attribute types.
- Lobby owner can update lobby data and kick members.
- Members can only update their own member data.
- Destroying a lobby will kick all players from the lobby.
- The EOS backend only supports storing 32-bit integers as stats.
- You must define the type of each stat in Project Settings ahead of time.
- It can take up to 24 hours for a global leaderboard to start ingesting stats after
  you create it in the Epic Online Services developer portal.
- You can't have multiple ReadLeaderboardsAroundRank operations running at the same
  time.
- If you don't have a NativePlatformService set, you'll only be able to call ShowFriendsUI
  when the user is signed into an Epic Games account. All other external UI operations
  will fail.
- To upload data to Player Data Storage, you need to get the user cloud interface.
- You should register an event handler to know when data writing has completed.
- You must add the tag 'Default' when uploading the file, or the plugin will not list
  it when files are queried for the Title Storage service.
- The echo functionality does not appear to reliably work in EOS SDK 1.13.1.
- The input device volume can only effectively mute at 0.0f; otherwise treated as
  100.0f.
- You can't use voice-enabled lobbies on dedicated servers, because using EOS lobbies
  requires a signed in user, which dedicated servers don't have.
- Dedicated servers cannot use peer-to-peer connections.
- IP connections are suitable for LAN traffic or dedicated servers.
- You need to be using the configuration above even if your game is only using dedicated
  servers over IP. Using the Redpoint networking driver is required for session registration,
  automatic encryption, trusted dedicated servers, sanction checks and Anti-Cheat
  support.
- Network authentication is turned on by default in new projects.
- Connecting split-screen clients to listen servers is not supported when network
  authentication is turned on.
- You must have network authentication turned in your Project Settings. It is turned
  on by default in new projects.
- By default the plugin will prevent you from selecting desktop or mobile platforms
  as trusted platforms, as they are not able to suitably protect the private keys.
- It is not possible to rename start_protected_game.exe to MyGame.exe, as the EOS
  bootstrapper is already extracted to MyGame.exe.
- It is highly recommended that you use seamless travel for travelling to new maps
  in packaged games. Non-seamless travel is not well maintained by Epic Games, and
  is broken in Unreal Engine 5.0.
- Epic Games Store e-commerce only works from packaged games. You must packaged the
  game on Windows so that the EOS bootstrapper launches the game.
- When purchasing offers on Steam, there is no notification for a successful purchase.
- You must handle deferred purchases on Google Play.
- If you don't have a NativePlatformService set, you won't be able to use any external
  UI calls except for showing the friends list, and even then only when the user is
  signed into an Epic Games account.
