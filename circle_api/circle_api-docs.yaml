auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.circle.com/circle-mint/authentication:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}". The API key must be properly encoded in the
    header, otherwise requests will return a 401 error with message "Malformed authorization.
    Are the credentials properly encoded?".
  - Use Bearer token authentication with API keys. Set the Authorization header to
    Bearer YOUR_API_KEY for all requests. The API key must be obtained from the Developer
    section in sandbox and kept confidential. All requests require HTTPS.
- information_source; https://developers.circle.com/circle-mint/getting-started-with-the-circle-apis:
  - API requests require an API key passed in the Authorization header using Bearer
    token format. Set the Authorization header to "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" where YOUR_API_KEY
    is your secret key value. The API key must be stored securely on your backend
    server and never exposed in client-side code or public repositories.
- information_source; https://developers.circle.com/circle-mint/getting-started-with-the-circle-core-api:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" for all requests to the Circle API endpoints.
  - 'Circle''s API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}" when making requests to Circle''s
    endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.circle.com/circle-mint/pagination-and-filtering:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation via HTTP Link header with rel="self",
    "first", "next", and "prev" relations. Request page size with optional pageSize
    query parameter (each resource has a maximum limit); cursors are tied to filter
    parameters, and iteration ends when next link is absent on the last page.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation via Link header with rel values. Request
    parameters include pageAfter (cursor) and pageSize (default 50). Response Link
    header contains self, first, next, and prev URLs with rel attributes. Construct
    subsequent requests using the next link URL from the response header instead of
    manually building URLs.
  - Use query parameters from (ISO 8601 UTC start date, inclusive) and to (ISO 8601
    UTC end date, inclusive, defaults to now) for date filtering. Pagination uses
    page query parameter for page-based navigation across collection resources sorted
    by createDate DESC. See the pagination-and-filtering documentation for complete
    pagination details.
