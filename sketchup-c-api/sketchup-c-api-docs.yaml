notes:
- All interactions with the SketchUp C API must be performed from the main thread
  to avoid unexpected behavior and application instability.
- Sketchup uses inches for internal geometric values such as length, area and volume.
- Geometry is not merged when added through the API except when using SUEntitiesFill.
- Requires setup of connected app in SketchUp
