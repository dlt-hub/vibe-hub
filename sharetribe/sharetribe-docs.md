In this guide, we'll set up a complete Sharetribe data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def sharetribe_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://www.sharetribe.com/api/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "users",
            "marketplace",
            "listings"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='sharetribe_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='sharetribe_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(sharetribe_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from sharetribe‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Users: Access user data and manage user accounts.
- Marketplace: Retrieve information about the marketplace itself.
- Listings: Manage and retrieve listings within the marketplace.
- Transactions: Access transaction records between users.
- Events: Get events related to the marketplace activities.
- Bookings: Manage and access booking information.
- Messages: Access and manage messages between users.
- Reviews: Access and manage reviews made by users.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Sharetribe workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@sharetribe-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Sharetribe support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:sharetribe duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Sharetribe API, as specified in @sharetribe-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "users" and "marketplace" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in sharetribe_pipeline.py and name the pipeline sharetribe_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python sharetribe_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed via OAuth 2.0 with a refresh_token flow. Tokens are acquired through a specific token endpoint using client credentials.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.sharetribe.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python sharetribe_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline sharetribe load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset sharetribe_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/sharetribe.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline sharetribe_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("sharetribe_pipeline").dataset()
   # get users table as Pandas frame
   data.users.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Supports incremental sync for all streams except the marketplace. Common errors include 401 Unauthorized, which may require rechecking OAuth scopes or token expiration; 403 Forbidden, suggesting permission issues; and 404 Not Found, which could mean there are issues with the endpoint path or parameters.
