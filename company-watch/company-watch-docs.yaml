  paginator: Pagination is required on endpoints that may return a large list of objects,
    and it must be applied using the `limit` and `offset` parameters; the `limit`
    parameter must be included in the request, with a default page size not specified,
    and endpoints supporting pagination will return a `pagination` object as part
    of the response.
