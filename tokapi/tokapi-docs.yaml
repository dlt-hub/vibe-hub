auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.tokapi.online/:
  - API Key authentication is required. Send the API key via the x-project-name header
    with value "tokapi" (or appropriate project name). The user_id path parameter
    and region query parameter (default "VN") are also required for this endpoint.
  - 'API key authentication is required via the x-project-name header. Additionally,
    three custom headers must be provided: x-devicerequired, x-cookierequired, and
    x-proxyrequired, each containing specific string values (device info, cookie string,
    and proxy details respectively).'
  - 'API key authentication is required, sent via the ApiKeyAuth scheme. Additionally,
    the following headers are required: x-device (JSON string with device info), x-cookie
    (cookie string), x-proxy (proxy information), and x-project-name (defaults to
    "tokapi"). The user_id is required as a path parameter.'
  - API key authentication is required, sent via the x-project-name header. Additionally,
    room_id and user_id query parameters are required for the request.
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `x-project-name` header
    with a default value of "tokapi". Additionally, an `x-device` header parameter
    is expected in requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.tokapi.online/:
  - Pagination uses a cursor parameter (integer, query parameter, default 0). The
    response indicates whether more results are available, and the cursor value from
    the response should be used in the next request to retrieve the next page of messages.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with the cursor query parameter (integer,
    default 0). The response structure is not shown, so the mechanism for retrieving
    the next page cannot be fully determined from this documentation.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. The response includes a "cursor" field
    (integer) for the next page and a "has_more" field (integer, where 1 indicates
    more data exists). Pass the cursor value in subsequent requests to retrieve the
    next set of results; stop when has_more is 0.
  - Pagination uses a scroll_param query parameter (optional, default empty string)
    to retrieve subsequent pages of products. The count query parameter (optional,
    default 20) controls the number of products returned per request. Pass the scroll_param
    value from the previous response to fetch the next batch of results.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with a cursor query parameter (integer,
    default 0) passed in the request. The response includes next_cursor field and
    has_more boolean; continue pagination by using the next_cursor value in the subsequent
    request until has_more is false.
