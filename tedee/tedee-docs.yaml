auth_info:
- information_source; https://tedee-tedee-api-doc.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting-started.html:
  - Bearer Token authentication is required. Include your access token (JWT) in the
    Authorization header as a Bearer token. The Authorization header must contain
    either a personal access key (PAK) or JWT access token obtained from the authentication
    endpoint. Additionally, POST, PUT, and PATCH requests require the Content-Type
    header set to application/json.
  - Every request requires an authentication token obtained as a JWT. To authenticate,
    acquire a JWT token through the dedicated authentication section, then include
    it in the Authorization tab of your REST client (e.g., Postman). The specific
    header name, parameter format, and token acquisition flow are detailed in the
    authenticate section referenced in the documentation.
  - 'The API uses stateless authentication with either Personal Access Keys (PAK)
    or JWT tokens. Credentials must be included in the Authorization header with each
    request using the format "Authorization: PersonalKey <<personal access key>>"
    for PAK or "Authorization: Bearer <<jwt token>>" for JWT. Requests prefixed with
    /my/ return only resources accessible to the authenticated user.'
