    token. The token is obtained from the Authenticate Endpoint and must be included
    in requests as "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}".'

    client_id and client_secret in the JSON request body to obtain an access token.
    The response contains a JWT token in the response.token field with an expiration
    time in response.validity. Use this token for subsequent API requests.
