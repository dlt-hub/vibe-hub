auth_info:
- information_source; https://community.panopto.com/discussion/191/oauth2-token-2019-07-09:
  - Panopto uses OAuth2 for API authentication. API clients are created and managed
    through Panopto's admin interface, requiring a Client ID and Client Secret. Access
    tokens are obtained via the OAuth2 authorization code flow, where the YourClientAPIKey
    is the Base64-encoded value of ClientId:ClientSecret, YourClientRedirectURL is
    the registered redirect URI for your application, and GeneratedNonceValue is a
    unique value generated per request. The access token is then sent in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token for subsequent REST API calls.
- information_source; https://community.panopto.com/discussion/206/statuscode-403-reasonphrase-forbidden-2019-12-12:
  - Basic authentication with credentials formatted as "username:password" encoded
    in Base64, sent via the Authorization header with "Basic" scheme. After obtaining
    an access token, use Bearer token authentication by sending the token in the Authorization
    header with "Bearer" scheme. The error indicates insufficient scope permissions
    for the requested operation.
- information_source; https://community.panopto.com/discussion/2121/panopto-public-api-authentication-failing:
  - The Panopto REST API uses OAuth2 access tokens for authentication. Credentials
    should be provided as OAuth2 client credentials (client ID and client secret),
    and the resulting access token should be included in API calls. The API does not
    use cookie-based authentication.
- information_source; https://community.panopto.com/discussion/2122/understanding-soap-api-documentation:
  - 'The Panopto SOAP API supports two authentication methods: either include userkey
    and password in the auth section of the SOAP request, or alternatively send a
    cookie previously obtained from the Auth SOAP API. The auth section is optional
    if you use the cookie approach. When including credentials directly, pass userkey
    and password as auth parameters in the SOAP request body.'
- information_source; https://community.panopto.com/discussion/2390/rest-api-no-result-when-home-folder-has-no-subfolders:
  - The Panopto API uses access tokens for authentication with the REST API. To access
    SOAP API endpoints, first call the LegacyLogin REST API endpoint with your access
    token to obtain an authorization cookie, then include that cookie in subsequent
    SOAP API calls instead of sending authentication credentials directly.
