- information_source; https://docs.tetrate.io/service-bridge/1.11.x/reference/rest-api/guide:
  - 'TSB REST API uses two authentication mechanisms: basic authentication via the
    HTTP Authorization header with base64-encoded username:password, and JWT token
    authentication. For basic auth, send the Authorization header with value "Basic
    base64(username:password)".'
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. Basic Authentication uses the Authorization
    header with base64-encoded username:password credentials formatted as "Authorization:
    Basic base64(username:password)". JWT Token Authentication uses the x-tetrate-token
    header to send a JWT token, for example "x-tetrate-token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...".'
- ? information_source; https://docs.tetrate.io/service-bridge/1.12.x/howto/gateway/application-gateway-with-openapi-annotations
  : - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
      via the curl -u flag, which translates to an Authorization header with Basic
      auth encoding. The credentials are used for rate limiting purposes where different
      users (alice, bob) have different rate limit quotas.
- information_source; https://docs.tetrate.io/service-bridge/1.12.x/operations/users/oidc-azure:
  - AzureAD OAuth2 client credentials grant flow is used for service principal authentication.
    Obtain a token by sending a POST request to https://login.microsoftonline.com/<directoryID>/oauth2/token
    with grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, client_secret, and resource parameters,
    then pass the resulting access_token to tctl login --use-token-exchange --access-token
    <token>. The client_id must match the tokenExchange.clientId configured in ManagementPlane.
    Device code login is also supported via tctl login --use-device-code for end-user
    OIDC authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.tetrate.io/service-bridge/1.12.x/howto/gateway/end-user-auth-keycloak:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send access tokens in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>". Different user roles (e.g., admin, normal)
    have different endpoint access permissions enforced by the authorization policy.
