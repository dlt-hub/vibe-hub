auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api/delete-tokenized-pay-method:
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Send credentials as a Username and Password
    in the request, which will be encoded in the Authorization header using the Basic
    auth scheme (base64-encoded "username:password").
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api/delete-an-ach-account:
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent as a username and
    password in the Authorization header using the Basic auth scheme (base64-encoded
    "username:password" format).
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api/querying-for-ach-accounts:
  - 'The documentation shows an HTTP request to a ChargeOver API endpoint with an
    "Auth" section that indicates Username and Password authentication is required,
    but no specific header names, parameter names, or implementation details are provided
    in the excerpt. Based on the visible "Auth" label with "Username" and "Password"
    fields, this API uses basic authentication, which typically requires sending credentials
    as a Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header with the format "Basic
    base64(username:password)". However, the exact header name and encoding method
    are not explicitly stated in this documentation chunk.


    Since the auth mechanism is mentioned ("Auth" with "Username" and "Password")
    but implementation details are not fully specified in the provided text, the most
    reasonable interpretation is basic HTTP authentication, though the exact technical
    details for Python implementation are not completely clear from this excerpt alone.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api-information/getting-started/:
  - To retrieve a subset of items from a list, use the offset and limit query parameters.
    offset specifies the starting record number and limit specifies the maximum number
    of records to return per request, similar to SQL database pagination.
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api/querying-for-pay-method-tokens:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of results per request (example value 2), and offset specifies the starting position
    (example value 8). The response contains an array of tokenized pay method objects;
    construct subsequent requests by incrementing the offset value by the limit to
    fetch the next page.
- information_source; https://developer.chargeover.com/docs/api/querying-for-ach-accounts:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (page size) and offset (starting
    position). Continue paginating by incrementing offset by the limit value until
    fewer results than limit are returned or no more data is available.'
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters limit (default or specified
    page size) and offset (starting position) in the request. The response returns
    an array of objects without explicit pagination metadata fields like next, has_more,
    or total_count visible in the schema provided.
