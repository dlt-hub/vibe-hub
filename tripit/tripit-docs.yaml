auth_info:
- information_source; https://tripit.github.io/api/doc/v1/:
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed as `<username>:<password>`
    in the request, encoded in base64 and sent via the Authorization header with the
    scheme "Basic".
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as username and password
    using the --user flag (or Authorization header with base64-encoded "username:password")
    when making requests to https://api.tripit.com/v1/ endpoints.
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials using the --user flag
    with username:password format in the Authorization header (e.g., curl --user <username>:<password>).
  - Basic authentication is required, with credentials provided via the --user flag
    in the format username:password, which curl translates to an Authorization header
    with Base64-encoded credentials.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://tripit.github.io/api/doc/v1/:
  - 'Pagination is activated for /v1/list/object and /v1/list/trip endpoints when
    past==true, page_num is specified, or upcoming trips exceed 50. Use query parameters
    page_num and page_size (defaults: 5 for trips, 25 for objects; both require positive
    integers). Response includes pagination state to construct subsequent requests.'
  - Pagination uses page_num (current page number) and page_size (items per page)
    as request parameters. Default page_size is 5 for trips and 25 for objects. Response
    includes page_num, page_size, and max_page fields. page_num must be less than
    or equal to max_page to determine when pagination ends.
