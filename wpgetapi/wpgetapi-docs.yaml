notes:
- The WordPress REST API is included as part of WordPress Core since version 4.7.
- HTMX allows HTML to request new HTML from the server.
- HTMX does not require a separate client application.
- HTMX is designed for applications like WordPress that prefer server-side APIs.
- There is no documentation on the website, mainly because the developer is confident
  in its plugin interface descriptions.
- Plugins don't always work
- WordPress-familiar teams don't always 'get' headless
- Debugging can become more difficult
- WYSIWYG is more difficult
