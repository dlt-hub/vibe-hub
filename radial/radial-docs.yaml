notes:
- Validate Request Against XSD
- Use Unique Request ID
- Use CatalogID as a Prefix to ItemID
- Log Requests and Responses
- Design Tests for Future Compatibility

  get request or an inventory allocate request, order capture and submission should
  continue as normal.
- If no response is received from the web service layer for an address validate request,
  order capture and submission should continue as normal.
- If no response is received from the web service layer for a tax quote request, order
  capture and submission should continue, however no tax should be displayed to the
  consumer during the remainder of checkout.

  request, order capture and submission should continue as normal.
