notes:
- PDM plugins can be developed and published as standalone PyPI projects.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- You can specify the overrides in the `pyproject.toml` file, under the `[tool.pdm.resolution.overrides]`
  table.
- Override files serve as an easy way to store the dependencies in a centralized location
  that can be shared by multiple projects in your organization.
- 'The configuration files are stored in the order of priority: project, home, site.'
- Password management with keyring is supported.
- You can completely skip certain packages and their dependencies during dependency
  resolution.
- Added in version 2.16.0
- Added in version 2.13.0
- Added in version 2.20.2
- Tasks with a name starting with an underscore (`_`) are considered internal (helpers...)
  and are not shown in the listing.
- Pre & post scripts can't receive any arguments.
- Composite tasks can also have pre and post scripts.
- PDM can't be installed on Python < 3.7
- Known compatibility issue on Ubuntu virtual environment for parallel install
- PEP 582 has been rejected. However, due to the fact that this feature is the reason
  for PDM's birth, PDM will retain the support.
- We recommend using virtual environments instead.
- If the corresponding env var is set, the value will take precedence over what is
  saved in the config file.
- Commands available for managing packages and environments.
- Editable installations won't be overridden unless `--no-editable` is passed.
- PDM requires Python 3.9+ to be installed.
- It works on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Major and minor releases also include changes listed within prior beta releases.
- Respect certificates in env vars REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE and CURL_CA_BUNDLE when verifying
  SSL certificates.
- Allow pypi.verify_ssl to be configured via PDM_PYPI_VERIFY_SSL environmental variable.
- Clean logs older than 7 days.
- Polish the UI looking of locking packages to display the progress.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
