notes:
- A repeated scan that utilizes bidirectional segments for better scan efficiency.
- zero blocks to acquire means infinite acquisition
- The introduction of new markers is planned to reduce the complexity required for
  scan resizing.
- Public Members and Functions may vary by implementation.
- Ensure proper configuration of parameters for optimal performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'BUFFER_OVERFLOW: Ensure buffer size is adequate.'
- 'INVALID_PARAMETER: Check input parameters for correctness.'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
