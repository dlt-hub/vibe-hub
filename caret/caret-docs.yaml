notes:
- All API requests must include your API key in the Authorization header.
- Caret requires screen recording and microphone permissions to capture your meetings.
  These permissions are only used during active recording sessions.
- Caret is currently available for macOS only. Windows and Linux versions are planned
  for future releases.
- Workspace is a shared environment for accessing meeting recordings, transcripts,
  and notes.
- Caret automatically saves partial recordings, so you may be able to recover some
  of your transcription.
- Audio clarity and speaker clarity impact translation quality.
- Technical terminology may not translate accurately.
- API keys are workspace-specific and provide full access to the associated workspace’s
  resources.
- Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests.
- Rate limits are applied per API key and vary based on the endpoint and your subscription
  plan.
- Some resource-intensive operations may have lower specific limits, which will be
  documented in the relevant API reference section.
- Store webhook secrets in environment variables
- Always use HTTPS endpoints
- Process each event only once using the eventId field
- Respond quickly to webhook requests (process asynchronously)
- A Caret Enterprise workspace is required
- Admin permissions are necessary to configure webhooks
- Verify that your webhook URL is publicly accessible. Private or localhost URLs won’t
  receive events unless tunneled through a service like ngrok.
- Supports both online and in-person meeting notes
- Transcripts are available for recorded notes
- Caret secures webhooks using HMAC-SHA256 signatures.
- Each webhook includes an X-Caret-Signature header that you must verify.
- Store webhook secrets in environment variables.
- Always use HTTPS endpoints.
- Process each event only once using the eventId field.
- Respond quickly to webhook requests (process asynchronously).
- User role can be 'admin' or 'member'.
