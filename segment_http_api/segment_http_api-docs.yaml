auth_info:
- information_source; https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/:
  - Access tokens obtained from OAuth applications can be reused until expiry. The
    content-type header must be set to 'application/json' when sending data to Segment's
    HTTP API. Rate limits of 1,000 requests per second apply per workspace, with rejected
    requests returning HTTP 429 and Retry-After and X-RateLimit-Reset headers.
  - 'Basic authentication requires base64-encoding credentials in the format "username:password"
    (including the colon) and passing them in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Basic <encoded_credentials>". OAuth2 authentication uses Bearer tokens obtained
    from an Authorization Server; include the access token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" and optionally include the write key
    in the request payload as "writeKey". The Bearer token can be reused until expiration.'
  - 'The Tracking API supports three authentication methods. writeKey authentication
    sends the Write Key as a JSON field named "writeKey" in the request body, encrypted
    over HTTPS, with no authentication header required. Basic authentication uses
    HTTP Basic Auth with the Write Key as username and empty password, base64 encoded
    and sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic {encoded_value}".
    OAuth is also supported but details are not provided in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://segment.com/docs/api/config-api/:
  - 'Config API uses bearer token authentication. Obtain an access token by contacting
    Segment support, then include it in the Authorization header of requests as "Authorization:
    Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN". The token should be stored securely and cannot be retrieved
    later if lost.'
- information_source; https://segment.com/docs/api/config-api/authentication/:
  - 'The Config API requires Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header.
    Include the access token in requests as "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN".
    Different scopes control permissions; for example, the workspace:read scope only
    allows read operations, and attempting write operations with insufficient scope
    returns an "insufficient scope" error.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://segment.com/docs/api/config-api/api-design/:
  - The List method uses cursor-based pagination with optional `page_size` query parameter
    (defaults to 10 or 100 items). The response includes `next_page_token` field;
    pass this value as `page_token` parameter in the next request to fetch subsequent
    pages. When `next_page_token` is empty, pagination is complete.
