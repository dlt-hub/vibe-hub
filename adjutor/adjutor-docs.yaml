  for debits.
- Customers have 168 hours to send the activation amount.
- The Nigerian data privacy law requires that information for users must be gotten
  with clear consent.
- You must be licensed as a lender to use these services and your evidence of being
  licensed would be required before you are granted access to these APIs.
- This is the only mode available to users who are not KYC validated. This ensures
  all round compliance and reduces the risk of fraudulent activities.
- However, we have a no hit no charge policy so you get charged for only successful
  API calls.
- You must copy the API key displayed on your screen as you wonâ€™t be able to get it
  again except you Reset your API key.
- If you do not include your API key when making a request, or you use an incorrect/outdated
  key, the request will fail.
- Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to treat it as you would any other
  password and grant access only to those who need it.
- The Java SDK is available on GitHub on a private repo. To get access, please contact
  api@lendsqr.com. The installation instructions are on the repo README.
- OTP may not be delivered to the customer's phone on time or at all.
- OTP may be delivered to the customer's phone late due to GSM network delays
- Customer may not remember or have access to the phones or emails on record which
  means they may never be able to provide consent.
- The data returned may not be complete as banks may not have registered all the accounts
  for the customer.
- It is highly important to you set the specific decision model you wish to use for
  scoring.
- This is a beta, and so things may be a bit flaky at the edges.
- Access tokens often expire quickly, causing issues with your API calls.
- In the instance where the access token expires, you can use the refresh token to
  obtain a new access token.
- Depending on the use case, make sure to EXPLICITLY state what scopes you are requesting
  for in your request.
- Many of the Adjutor APIs are charged at commercial rates which means that your service
  account must be funded as the system debits this account for every successful API
  call.
- Lendsqr will make available to you a NGN1,000 credit so you can test out the capabilities
  of the API before committing to purchase it.
- You must be licensed as a lender to use these services.
