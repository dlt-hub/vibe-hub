notes:
- All new users must verify their email address.
- Verification links expire after 24 hours.
- RouterOS Version running on the router should be 6.48.7 Long Term or newer, or 7.8
  Stable or newer.
- The Default Policy is selected by default.
- Access is granted by generating a temporary username and password that you can use
  to log in to the router using WinBox or SSH.
- The credentials are short-lived and are automatically revoked after a configurable
  period.
- Transient Access provides temporary, secure access to MikroTik devices through a
  managed tunnel.
- The system continuously monitors the status of each WAN link, detecting faults within
  seconds.
- Any changes made to the interface order will take approximately 60 seconds to apply.
- Backups are performed daily.
- Faults are logged based on heartbeat checks and fault condition triggers.
- The dashboard displays real-time and historical faults.
- The management VPN facilitates secure management and operational monitoring through
  an OpenVPN tunnel.
- The management tunnel employs AES CBC encryption for securing data.
- Faults represent disruptions or issues present at your sites/ network, such as loss
  of connectivity, service degradation or hardware failures.
- Sites are configured to check in with MikroCloud every 30 seconds.
- If a site misses 10 consecutive heartbeats (a period of 5 minutes), a fault condition
  is recorded.
- The start time of a fault condition is backdated by 5 minutes from the current time.
- The fault condition is automatically cleared when the next heartbeat is successfully
  received.
- The downtime is calculated as the difference between the fault condition's start
  and end times.
- The management VPN uses OpenVPN, configured to connect to mgnt.mkcld.io over TCP
  port 8443.
- Ensure that your OAuth configurations are properly established and authorized within
  each identity provider's platform before activating your Captive Portal instance.
- Failure to do so may prevent users from successfully authenticating.
- Currently, only OAuth 2 is supported.
- This is an extremely important step in your Captive portal instance set up.
- Each account is limited to 10 VPN instances.
- Up to 250 sites can be added to a single VPN instance.
- Up to 250 users can be added to a single VPN instance.
- To create a VPN server, you must have at least 10 free seats available.
- Each user or site that you add to the VPN instance occupies one seat.
- 'Currently, you are limited in the following ways for the VPN service: Each account
  is limited to 10 VPN instances, Up to 250 sites can be added to a single VPN instance,
  Up to 250 Users can be added to a single VPN instance.'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Default Security Essentials policy includes pre-configured settings that ensures
  protection and a default block list of IP addresses and prefixes.
- MikroCloud auto-generates passwords for users, but in some cases, users are required
  to set their own passwords.
- Passwords are not stored in plain text. When a user logs in, the password they enter
  is hashed and compared to the stored hash.
- The upper limit when accessing short links is 60 requests per minute, per IP address.
- If not specified by the service that generated the short link, the short link will
  expire after 90 days.
- Removing a team will delete all associated resources and revoke access for its members.
- A user can only own one organization, but an organization can have multiple teams.
- All requests must be in JSON format.
- default PIN is `1234`
- The local IP address is **192.168.88.1**.
- Each router object provides detailed information about the router, including its
  identity, software version, uptime, and last seen details.
- MikroCloud auto-generates passwords for users
- Password must be at least 8 characters long
- Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number,
  and one special character
- New passwords should not match the last three passwords
- MikroCloud stores passwords using one-way hashing
- The synchronous API does not guarantee delivery and does not implement idempotent
  requests.
- 'Management Traffic Only: This feature is intended for management traffic, such
  as logging into a phone or printer. Heavy data transfer is not permitted.'
- 'TCP Only: Only TCP traffic is supported.'
- 'Duration: The maximum duration for a port forward is 1 day.'
- The token format is uuid:uuid:token, where the token is a 62-character alphanumeric
  string.
- Currently, API tokens are not generally available. Please contact support to obtain
  an API token.
- Metadata is a freeform key/value store, so it is possible that the response may
  include or exclude some properties.
errors:
- Rate limit of 5 requests per minute for resending verification email.
- 'FAULT_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE: Check status of the fault types.'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency.'
- Changes to the router configuration are generally not performed through the synchronous
  API due to its limitations in delivery assurance.
- 'WAN Tunnel Offline: This fault occurs when the WAN Tunnel(s), responsible for site
  communication, goes offline.'
- 'Site Rebooted: A site reboot fault is logged when a monitored site undergoes a
  restart.'
- 'Site Offline: This fault is recorded when an entire site loses connectivity and
  becomes unresponsive.'
- Changes to the router configuration are generally not performed through the synchronous
  API due to its limitations in delivery assurance and lack of idempotent request
  handling.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 60 requests per minute per API key.
- '204 No Content: Successful deletion of a port forward.'
