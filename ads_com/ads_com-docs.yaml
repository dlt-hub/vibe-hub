auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ads.com/:
  - An API key is required for authentication. The 401 Unauthorized response indicates
    no valid API key was provided, and the 403 Forbidden response indicates the API
    key lacks permissions for the requested operation. However, the documentation
    does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or method for sending
    the API key.
  - The Ads API uses API Key authentication. Send your API key in the X-API-KEY header
    with each request. All requests must use HTTPS. Retrieve and manage your API keys
    by logging into your account and navigating to Tracking > Api Keys.
