  - 'The API uses Basic Authentication for all requests. Credentials are sent via
    Basic Authentication (standard HTTP Authorization header with base64-encoded username:password).
    Rate limits are 5000 requests per hour per access_token. Current rate limit status
    is returned in response headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and
    X-RateLimit-Reset (Unix timestamp).'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an access_token. Credentials are
    passed as base64-encoded "username:access_token" either via curl''s -u flag or
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic [base64_encoded_credentials]".
    Requests without valid authentication return 403 Forbidden.'
