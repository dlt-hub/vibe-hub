auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.spacresearch.com/api:
  - All requests to the SPAC Research API must include an HTTP Authorization header.
    The documentation specifies that the Authorization header is required for all
    endpoints but does not detail the specific auth scheme, token format, or how to
    obtain credentials.
  - Send the HTTP Authorization header with a Bearer token in each request. The token
    should be formatted as "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN", where YOUR_API_TOKEN is your API
    secret found on your account page at spacresearch.com/account. Include this in
    the Authorization header of all API requests.
