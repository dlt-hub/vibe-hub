auth_info:
- information_source; https://webshop.one.com/api/v2/docs:
  - Auth uses BearerAuth scheme with tokens obtained via POST /auth/token/new. Send
    clientId and clientSecret as JSON in the request body to get a token, then use
    it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests. Tokens
    can be validated at /auth/token/validate and renewed at /auth/token/renew with
    the same clientId and clientSecret credentials.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" for all requests to the Order Email, Invoice Mail,
    and Shipping Information endpoints.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" for endpoints including Download Order as PDF and Orders as
    CSV.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}".
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://webshop.one.com/api/v2/docs:
  - Pagination uses pageNumber and pageSize query parameters. pageSize is an integer
    with a maximum of 200, and pageNumber is an integer for specifying which page
    to retrieve. Both are optional query parameters.
  - Pagination uses pageSize (query parameter, integer, max 200) and pageNumber (query
    parameter, integer) to request specific pages of draft orders. Response structure
    for pagination fields is not documented in the provided excerpt.
  - The second endpoint "GET Customers Details" uses offset-limit pagination. The
    limit query parameter specifies the number of results per request (example provided
    but no min/max stated), and offset specifies the starting position. The response
    does not explicitly show pagination metadata fields like total_count or has_more,
    so you continue paginating by incrementing offset until fewer results than limit
    are returned or an empty array is received.
  - Use pageNumber and pageSize query parameters to paginate. pageSize is optional
    with maximum value of 200, pageNumber is optional. Response includes totalCount
    field indicating total number of draft orders available.
  - pageSize and pageNumber are query parameters for pagination. pageSize accepts
    an integer up to 200 (maximum page size), and pageNumber specifies which page
    to retrieve. Use pageNumber to navigate through pages sequentially.
