auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.restroworks.com/:
  - 'API Key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization header
    with the key name "Key" and the value as your API key (e.g., Authorization: Key
    <your_api_key_value>). The API key must be included in all requests to authenticate
    access to the Restroworks Data Integration API endpoints.'
  - This API uses API Key authentication passed as a query parameter. The required
    parameters are customer_key (outlet unique customer key), partner (partner name),
    and apiKey (the actual API key value labeled as KEY_PROVIDED). All three must
    be included as query parameters in the GET request URL.
  - This request uses API Key authentication from the Data Integration folder. The
    API key should be included as part of the request, likely in the Authorization
    header or as a query parameter, though the exact header name and format are not
    explicitly specified in the provided documentation. The customer_key parameter
    is also required as a query parameter in the format customer_key=<<OUTLET_UNIQUE_CUSTOMER_KEY>>.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.restroworks.com/:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (integer, example value 1) to request specific
    pages of bill results. The documentation does not specify response fields indicating
    total pages, has_more status, or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - 'The API uses page-based pagination with a page query parameter (example: page=1)
    to request specific pages of results. The documentation does not specify response
    fields indicating pagination state (such as total_pages, has_more, or next_page),
    default page values, or when to stop paginating.'
