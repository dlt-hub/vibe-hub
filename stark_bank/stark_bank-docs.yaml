notes:
- Uses ECDSA for authentication by signing requests with a private key.
- Get a paged list of all deposit logs. A log tracks a change in the deposit entity
  according to its life cycle.
- Get a list of non-deleted boletos in chunks of at most 100.
- Max results per cursor is 100
- The Merchant Session resource can be created by a merchant and used by the card
  holder in order to collect their card data without having to handle it on the merchant's
  side.
- Get a list of merchant cards in chunks of at most 100.
- Canceled transfers will still appear in your queries.
- Initially, the brcode entity amount will be zero because the brcode is processed
  asynchronously.
- Payments that have already been processed can be deleted, but not cancelled.
- Get a receipt for payments whose status are either success, processing or created.
- Logs are pretty useful for understanding the life cycle of each payment and the
  changes that happened to it.
- Registered webhooks will only work for services used in that same version.
- It is recommended to create a daily task to get all undelivered events.
- Get a list of non-deleted events in chunks of at most 100. If you need smaller chunks,
  use the limit parameter.
