notes:
- Is it possible to make a REST API call from the HC2 / HC3 control unit to external
  sites?
- 'If you do a ''read configuration'' the HC3 answers: ''Device configuration read
  successfully'' but does not show the configuration at all.'
- Registration is required to view all content and post in community.
