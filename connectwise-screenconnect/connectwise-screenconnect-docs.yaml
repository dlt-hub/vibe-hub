- Custom integrations can only be enabled by users with the Rewst Admin role.
- V1 of custom integrations is deprecated and should no longer be used.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ConnectWise ScreenConnect utilizes the CustomProperty1 property—typically referenced
  as Company within the UI—to store the organization name.
- 'Ensure that you check on the following minimum permissions: ManageSessionGroups,
  ViewSessionGroup, ViewSessionGuestScreenshot, JoinSession, TransferSession, EditSession,
  RunCommandOutsideSession, AddNoteToSession, RemoveNoteFromSession, RemoveCommandFromSession,
  ReinstallSession, TransferFiles, PrintinSession, RunSharedToolAsUser, RunSharedToolAsSystemSilently,
  RunPersonalToolAsUser, RunPersonalToolAsSystemSilently, HostSessionWithoutConsent,
  ManageCredentials, SwitchLogonSession, CreateDelegatedAccessToken, EnableBackstageLogonSession,
  RespondToElevationRequest.'
- If refresh options are not working, change the root session group to All Machines
  to see if it pulls in customers.
- ConnectWise PSA was previously known as ConnectWise Manage.
- Note that you'll need to be signed in to ConnectWise PSA to view the documentation.
- Pods do not allow the use of the fat client due to authorization pass-through issues.
- Update your Rewst base URL to match your geographic Rewst instance.
- Firefox users must set network.cookie.cookieBehavior to 4 for successful pod authentication.
- User must have API Authentication enabled within Cove.
- You can use a custom URL if you have a custom N-able N-sight environment.
- Generic action for making authenticated requests against the N-able N-sight API.

- Currently no way to identify a domain controller via the N-able REST API. Must manually
  set the hostname of the preferred DC.
- Token will only be displayed once, and cannot be retrieved once the dialog is closed.
- Enables automation of remote monitoring and management.
- If you have IP address restrictions in place, you'll need to add the Rewst IP to
  your allowed list. The IP for Rewst is 3.139.170.31.
