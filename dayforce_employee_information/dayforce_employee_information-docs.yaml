- information_source; https://help.dayforce.com/r/documents/Dayforce-RESTful-Web-Services-Developer-Guide:
  - Access tokens are obtained via OAuth2 and returned with token_type "Bearer" and
    an expires_in value (standard 3600 seconds). To request Dayforce APIs, include
    the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". User
    security access is enforced based on the authenticated account.
- information_source; https://help.dayforce.com/r/documents/Dayforce-RESTful-Web-Services-Developer-Guide/Authentication:
  - Access tokens are obtained via OAuth2 Bearer token flow with a 3600-second expiration.
    Include the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" when
    making API requests to Dayforce APIs.
  - Dayforce REST services support two authentication methods. First, HTTP basic authentication
    protocol where credentials are passed with each request; note that some third-party
    REST clients may not include credentials on redirect responses, potentially causing
    401 errors. Second, token-based authentication where an access token is obtained
    from the Dayforce identity service API using Web Services login credentials, then
    used in subsequent API requests instead of sending username and password with
    each call. Additionally, the user account must have Web Services feature access
    enabled on its default role, with at minimum the Web Services and Read Data sub-features
    configured.

  : - Data returned from Dayforce REST Services is filtered based on field-level and
      access authorizations associated with the default role of the authenticated
      user account. The user role must have access to both the data and fields for
      proper filtering to apply.

      Anywhere > Web Services > Patch/Post Labor Metrics Code role feature, which
      must be configured in System Admin > Roles > Features tab.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://help.dayforce.com/r/documents/Dayforce-RESTful-Web-Services-Developer-Guide/Pagination-of-Response-Data
  : - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with a `Next` field in the `Paging`
      response object containing a complete URL for the next page. Optionally specify
      `pageSize` query parameter to control records per page (default 1,000). When
      `Next` is an empty string, pagination is complete.
    - Response data is paginated using a `Paging` element containing a `Next` property
      with the URI to the next page. When `Next` is an empty string, pagination is
      complete. Use the provided URI directly to retrieve subsequent pages.
    - The response includes a "Paging" object with a "Next" field containing a string
      value that represents the URL or token for retrieving the next page of results.
      Use this "Next" value to construct subsequent requests for pagination.

  : - "The EmployeePayAdjustments API supports pagination and returns responses in\
      \ multiple pages based on payload size. You must check for the next page of\
      \ the response. However, the specific pagination mechanism (request parameters,\

    - The EmployeePunches API supports pagination with responses returned in multiple
      pages depending on payload size. Refer to the Pagination of Response Data documentation
      for details on checking for the next page and handling paginated responses.
