auth_info:
- information_source; https://maileroo.com/blog/send-email-with-java/:
  - The API requires authentication via an API key passed as `MAILEROO_API_KEY`. The
    key should be included in requests to authenticate with the Maileroo service,
    though the exact header or parameter name for sending the key is not explicitly
    specified in this documentation excerpt.
- information_source; https://maileroo.com/docs/email-api/introduction/:
  - Sending keys (API keys) are used to authenticate requests to the Maileroo Email
    API. Include your sending key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token when
    making requests to the API endpoints.
- information_source; https://maileroo.com/docs/email-verification/getting-started/:
  - The Zeruh API uses API key authentication passed as a query parameter or form
    parameter. Include the api_key parameter with your API key value in either the
    URL query string (e.g., ?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY) or as a form parameter in POST
    requests (e.g., -d "api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"). Invalid API keys return a 403 Forbidden
    response.
  - 'Zeruh API supports three authentication methods: X-Api-Key header (recommended),
    api_key query parameter, or api_key form parameter. All methods use the same API
    key value obtained from your account.'
- information_source; https://maileroo.com/features/email-api:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY header is required. Send your API key as a
    Bearer token in the Authorization header when making requests to the Maileroo
    API.'
