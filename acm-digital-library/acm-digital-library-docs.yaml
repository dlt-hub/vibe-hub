notes:
- The development of Web APIs is rather autonomous, guided by no established standards
  or rules.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Promotes reuse of existing standards and technologies.
- Testing RESTful APIs thoroughly is critical due to their key role in software integration.
- Automation in test data generation provides a useful way of generating test data
  in a fast and efficient manner.
- Automated test generation often results in large test suites that are hard to evaluate
  and investigate manually.
- EvoMaster is primarily focused on RESTful APIs.
- Automated test generation tool that supports both black-box and white-box testing.
- The OpenAPI schema allows users to define enum constraints, to define a list of
  acceptable values for a particular input.
- Manually generated schemas are difficult and costly to maintain and can quickly
  become obsolete and unsupported.
- DBSCAN requires a distance function to calculate pairwise distances between the
  individual test cases.
- DBSCAN does not require that the number of clusters is defined in advance.
- The algorithm is robust in terms of the shape of clusters and in terms of noise
  and outliers.
- The last executed line provides useful information for identifying and classifying
  faults.
- scout-api wraps all errors by default and removes all information from the error
  messages, with the exception of the 'code 500' text.
- feature-service removes all text from the error, leaving the system unable to conduct
  clustering according to the error message at all.
- Clustering according to the last executed line proved to be problematic, as the
  distance between two 'last executed lines' components is somewhat uneven.
- Healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) applications require rigorous testing to ensure
  their dependability.
- Such applications are typically integrated with various third-party healthcare applications
  and medical devices through REST APIs.
- The ACM Digital Library is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.
- In industry, RESTful APIs are widely used to build modern Cloud Applications.
- Testing them is challenging, because not only do they rely on network communications,
  but also they deal with external services like databases.
- The search was conducted on March 1, 2022.
- Most articles deal with presenting a novel technique aiming at fault finding.
- This survey provides a clear picture of the current state-of-the-art in the testing
  of REST APIs.
- No authentication required for accessing the API.
- Published on 27 June 2024
- Fuzzing sessions were run for 1 hour each.
- Each experiment was repeated 10 times.
- Experiments were run in parallel (15 at a time).
- Results are statistically significant for only six APIs, with no statistically worse
  results.
- Running fuzzing sessions for longer (e.g., 10 hours vs. 1 hour) could lead to better
  results.
- GraphQL is a query language and execution engine for web application programming
  interfaces (APIs) proposed as an alternative to improve data access problems and
  versioning of representational state transfer APIs.
- The systematic mapping study aims to provide an overview of the scientific community’s
  production and find knowledge gaps around the GraphQL paradigm.
- GraphQL is a novel approach to APIs development that is gaining traction and interest
  from both researchers and practitioners.
- API design requires careful domain model design
- Patterns help to avoid API designs that lead to or are caused by anemic domain model

- Modern web services increasingly rely on REST APIs.
- Web services rely heavily on REST APIs, typically documented using the OpenAPI specification.
- Rate limiting is enforced on the API.
- Requires setup of a Spotify developer application.
