  - 'All API calls require authentication using a Seafile API token passed in the
    Authorization header. Obtain the token by sending a POST request to /api2/auth-token/
    with username and password as form data, then include the returned token in subsequent
    requests as Authorization: Token <token_value>.'
  - Authentication uses token-based access. Obtain a token by POST to /api2/auth-token/
    with username and password parameters. For two-factor authentication, include
    the X-SEAFILE-OTP header with the OTP token. Use the token in subsequent requests
    via the Authorization header as "Token <token_value>". If special characters are
    in credentials, use --data-urlencode for proper processing.
