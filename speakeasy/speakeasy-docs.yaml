auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.speakeasy.com/api-design/file-uploads:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The token
    is required for all upload requests and is used by the API to infer the user identity,
    eliminating the need to explicitly specify user information in the request. The
    exact header format is "Authentication: Bearer <token>".'
  - Authorization header using Bearer token scheme. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" when making requests to the YouTube Data API v3 upload
    endpoint.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN is required in the PUT request header when uploading
    video files to the YouTube API resumable upload endpoint.'
  - 'The input contains authentication information. Here is the extraction:


    Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" when making requests to protected endpoints like image
    uploads.'
- information_source; https://www.speakeasy.com/product/api-docs:
  - The API uses OAuth token-based authentication. Credentials should be passed in
    the security configuration with the key "oauthToken" set to your OAuth token value,
    as shown in the SDK initialization examples.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/sdks/customize/runtime/pagination:
  - Offset-based pagination uses an `offset` parameter (in query, path, or header)
    that is incremented by the length of the `results` array from each response. Cursor-based
    pagination uses a `cursor` parameter (typically in request body) set to the `nextCursor`
    value from the previous response. URL-based pagination returns a direct URL for
    the next page.
  - URL-based pagination uses a `next` field in the response containing the full next
    URL to request. For page-based pagination, a `page` variable is incremented with
    each request, optionally stopping when results returned are less than a specified
    limit. For cursor-based pagination, a `cursor` variable is populated from a response
    field (via JSONPath) and used in subsequent requests. All pagination inputs are
    passed as query/path parameters or in the request body, and outputs are extracted
    using JSONPath expressions.
