auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/docs/errors:
  - 'The request lacks valid authentication credentials if the `Authorization` header
    is missing, the token is invalid, expired, or revoked. Include a valid access
    token in the `Authorization` header to resolve 401 Unauthorized errors. Access
    control is also enforced: a 403 Forbidden indicates the authenticated user lacks
    required roles or permissions for the requested resource or action.'
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/docs/guides/authentication:
  - Access to the LawVu Developer API uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Clients
    must direct users to the authorize endpoint at GET https://{web_host}/#/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri},
    where web_host is demo.lawvu.com for sandbox or go.lawvu.com for production, client_id
    identifies your application, and redirect_uri is where LawVu returns the auth
    code as a query parameter after user consent.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with JWT tokens. Obtain an authorization code via
    redirect_uri and client_id query parameters, then exchange it for an access token
    using a POST request with grant_type, client_id, and code in the request body.
    The access token is a JWT that can be decoded to extract claims like organisationId.
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/docs/guides/creating-contracts:
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token> in requests to the POST /v2/files
    and POST /v2/contracts endpoints.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <your_access_token>" for all contract creation requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/new-api/lawvuapi.openapi/contracts:
  - Pagination uses query parameters $skip and $top. $skip specifies items to skip
    (default 0), and $top specifies maximum items to return (default 25). Both are
    optional integers.
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/new-api/lawvuapi.openapi/fields:
  - $skip and $top query parameters enable offset-based pagination. $skip (default
    0) specifies items to skip, and $top specifies the maximum items to return per
    request. Use the values from the response to construct subsequent requests by
    incrementing $skip.
  - The endpoint supports offset-based pagination using $skip (number of items to
    skip, default 0) and $top (maximum items to return, default 25) query parameters.
    The response returns an items array containing the paginated results.
  - The endpoint uses offset-limit pagination with query parameters $skip (default
    0, specifies items to skip) and $top (default 25, specifies maximum items to return).
    The response returns an items array containing the paginated results.
- information_source; https://api-docs.lawvu.com/new-api/lawvuapi.openapi/matters:
  - $skip and $top are query parameters used for pagination. $skip (default 0, int32)
    specifies how many items to skip, and $top (default 25, int32) specifies the maximum
    number of items to return. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing $skip
    by the number of items returned until fewer items than $top are returned, indicating
    the final page.
