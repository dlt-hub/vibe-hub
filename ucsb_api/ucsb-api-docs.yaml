- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- The form is used to gather information about the application that will be consuming
  the data in order for the data owners to better evaluate and approve the API access.
- The form gathers additional technical details required by the admins of the API
  management platform to evaluate the security measures that will be in place to protect
  the data that the application will have access to.
- The BasicAuth header is a base64-encoded(ucsbNetId:password) combination.
- This ucsbNetId needs to be supplied to the Office of the Registrar as part of the
  approval process.
