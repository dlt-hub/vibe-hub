auth_info:
- information_source; https://nlp.insightera.co.th/docs/v1.0/:
  - Every classification model requires the same secret token that was used during
    the training process to access it. Models are protected and can only be used by
    those who have the secret token. The token must be provided to access trained
    models.
  - 'Every classification models can be accessed only if users provide the same token
    used during training process. This means all models are protected. Only those
    who have access to a secret token can use the model.


    Based on this documentation, authentication uses a secret token that must be provided
    during model training and then again when accessing the model for predictions.
    The token is required to protect access to classification models, meaning the
    same token used to train a model must be supplied in subsequent requests to use
    that model. The documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter
    name, or request format for sending this token.'
  - Model ID and a secret token must be matched (the same token used when training
    a model) to use the prediction service. The secret token is required and must
    correspond to the model ID that was used during training.
