notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Use your test API key to simulate requests without triggering real verifications
  or incurring charges.
- Do not send any confidential or operational data when using the Sandbox.
- Run non-essential or routine batch jobs outside of peak hours.
- Throttle or limit the frequency of batch jobs.
- Implement exponential backoff for retries, starting with a 30-second delay.
- Prioritize requests that are essential to verifying active clients.
- Use webhooks instead of polling our API for updates.
- Requests that exceed the quota will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
- Requests will be paginated to 100 items by default.
- Clients are a core resource to all ComplyCube services.
- Some objects may have pagination requirements.
- All checks are asynchronous.
- The result object is only returned when the status of the check is complete.
- Returned values for outcome include clear, attention, or not_processed.
- It is highly recommended that you provide the client's date of birth in addition
  to the first and last names of persons.
- Results include multiple analysis types such as MRZ, RFID, and content analysis.
- The front side of the document will always be required.
- If the back side is not provided, the check will be conducted based on the front
  side alone.
- This check can only be performed on a client of type person.
- The documentId provided must have associated image attachments that adhere to image
  specifications.
- The documentId provided must have associated image attachments that adhere to our
  image specifications.
- The provided address must contain all required attributes.
- This check can only be initiated through a Workflow Session and is not supported
  for direct API calls.
- Requires the client to have an ssn attribute set.
- This check can only be performed on a client of type 'person'.
- The ID of the client associated with this check is required.
- The type must be set to 'identity_fraud_check'.
- The ID of the address is required.
- To run an Email Intelligence Check, you must create a check with type set to email_intelligence_check.
- This check requires the client to have a mobile attribute set.
- This service is only available through our Enterprise Plan
- Webhook notifications should be acknowledged with an HTTP 20x response within 15
  seconds.
- Tokens enable clients to send personal data to ComplyCube via our SDKs.
- The client-specific token expires after 60 minutes.
- Learn how to simulate specific responses during your integration before going live.
- Webhook endpoints might occasionally receive the same event more than once.
- ComplyCube does not guarantee the delivery of events in the order they are generated.
- Webhook events can be asynchronous, requiring specific handling based on event type.
- Ensure webhook endpoint is secure and supports HTTPS.
- Tokens enable clients to send personal data to ComplyCube via our SDKs securely.
- Handle rate limits and service quotas appropriately before going live.
- All 40x errors are gracefully avoided by ensuring requests are formed correctly
  and parameters are validated.
- An AML Screening Check takes under 1 second to complete.
- Utilizes ComplyCube's state-of-the-art AI and advanced analytics to perform 7 categories
  of analysis on government-issued ID documents.
- Highly recommended to run through Hosted Solution, Web SDK, or Mobile SDKs.
