auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.verified.eu/docs/api-documentation/584e632c71d0e-api-authentication:
  - JWT token-based authentication is required. Obtain a JWT token via the Retrieve
    token API, then include it in the Authorization header as "JWT <token>" or "Bearer
    <token>" for all API requests. Tokens expire after 7 days and can be renewed by
    making a GET request to https://app.verified.eu/api/auth/token with the current
    token in the Authorization header, which returns a new token valid for another
    7 days.
  - Requests are IP-locked by default as a security measure; if a request comes from
    a different IP than the one used during authentication, it will be rejected. To
    retrieve tokens without IP locking for use in distributed systems with dynamic
    IPs, add the query parameter withoutIpLock=1 to the POST /api/auth authentication
    endpoint.
  - The Verified API uses JWT bearer token authentication combined with company namespace
    isolation. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header as "JWT ey..." and
    add an x-namespace header with the value "/companies/{your_company_id}" (extracted
    from the user info endpoint at GET /auth/userinfo under the roles name path).
    All requests to an envelope require the same namespace header that was used during
    envelope creation. Additionally, IP locking is enforced, so requests must originate
    from the same IP address used during authentication.
  - 'To use the API you need to authenticate with Basic Auth (base64-encoded email:password)
    to POST /api/auth to retrieve a JWT token, then include that JWT and a company
    ID in HTTP headers for subsequent API requests. JWT tokens are valid for 7 days
    and must be renewed after expiration.


    **Token Retrieval:**

    - Endpoint: POST https://app.verified.eu/api/auth

    - Header: Authorization: Basic base64(email:password)

    - Returns: JWT token


    **API Requests:**

    - Include JWT token in HTTP headers (exact header name not specified in excerpt)

    - Include company ID in HTTP headers (exact header name not specified in excerpt)

    - Token validity: 7 days'
