notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires OAuth2 authentication
- Basic authentication may only be used with the Mambu API. However, we recommend
  using API keys instead of basic authentication whenever possible.
- Mambu automatically blocks any IP address that issues a total of 10 requests from
  an API consumer using invalid credentials. This applies even if the IP has been
  whitelisted.
- We're moving! We’ve launched a new and improved support site - designed to help
  you find answers faster and easier across support documentation and Mambu APIs.
- All requests must include the required viewfilter path parameter.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Mambu
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Mambu does not support versioning.
- APIs are backward-compatible for at least one release.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API v1 is no longer being actively developed. We strongly recommend that all customers
  use our API v2 endpoints for all new integrations and transition to API v2 endpoints
  for existing features wherever possible.
