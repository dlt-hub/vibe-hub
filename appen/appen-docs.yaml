    The api_key can also be passed as a query parameter named key.'

  - 'API key authentication is required via the Authorization header. Include the
    header "Authorization: Token token={api_key}" where api_key is your personal API
    key.'
  - 'API key authentication is required via the Authorization header. Send the API

    {api_key} is your personal API key passed as a query parameter named "key" or
    in the Authorization header.'
  - API key authentication is required, passed in the Authorization header as "Token

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.appen.com/:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (integer, required based on context) passed
    in the request to specify which page to retrieve, as shown in the example with
    page=1.
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, number of items) and offset (integer, number of
    items to skip) query parameters. The response is a flat array without pagination
    metadata fields, so continue requesting with incremented offset values until fewer
    items than limit are returned.
  - Use the page query parameter (integer) to paginate through Jobs. The documentation
    shows page as a query parameter for requesting a desired page, but does not specify
    response fields indicating pagination state, total pages, or how to determine
    when pagination ends.
  - Use the query parameter page (integer) to paginate through units, with a default
    of 1000 units per page. Increment page to retrieve subsequent pages and stop when
    an empty hash is returned.
