auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.openware.com/sdk/2.6/api/peatio/trading-api:
  - API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature scheme with three required headers.
    Send X-Auth-Apikey (your API key), X-Auth-Nonce (a unique value per request),
    and X-Auth-Signature (HMAC-SHA256 hex digest computed as OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest("SHA256",
    secret, nonce + api_key) where secret is your API secret).
  - 'API requests require three custom headers for authentication: X-Auth-Apikey (your
    API key), X-Auth-Nonce (a unique nonce value), and X-Auth-Signature (an HMAC signature).
    These headers must be included in all authenticated requests to the API endpoint.'
  - Authentication for private endpoints uses either cookies or API keys. For cookies,
    create a session by posting email and password to the identity/sessions endpoint,
    then include the session cookie in subsequent requests. For API keys (recommended),
    generate them via the UI or API and use them to authenticate private endpoint
    calls.
  - 'Authentication requires three custom HTTP headers: X-Auth-Apikey (your API key),
    X-Auth-Nonce (a unique nonce value), and X-Auth-Signature (an HMAC signature).
    These headers must be included in all authenticated requests to the API endpoint.'
  - Authentication uses API keys with HMAC-HS256. Create an API key via UI or API
    endpoint, receiving a kid (key ID) and secret value. Use these credentials to
    authenticate subsequent API requests, typically via Authorization header with
    the kid and secret for HMAC signing, or as query parameters depending on endpoint
    requirements.
