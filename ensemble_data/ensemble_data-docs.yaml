auth_info:
- information_source; https://ensembledata.com:
  - Token-based authentication is required. Pass your token via the "token" query
    parameter (in URL query string) or initialize the EDClient with your token string.
    The token value should be set to "YOUR-TOKEN-HERE" and replaced with your actual
    credentials.
- information_source; https://ensembledata.com/:
  - Token-based authentication is required. Pass your token as the `token` query parameter
    in the request URL, or initialize the EDClient SDK with your token string directly.
    The token should be provided as `"YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"` in the `token` parameter for
    direct API calls or as the first argument to EDClient for SDK usage.
- information_source; https://ensembledata.com/apis/docs:
  - API authentication uses a required token passed as a query parameter. Include
    the token parameter in your request URL or query parameters with your authentication
    token value.
  - API authentication uses a required token passed as a query parameter. Include
    the token query parameter with your request; the token value should be a string
    between 12 and some maximum length (exact length not specified in documentation).
  - API authentication uses a token-based approach. The token is passed as a required
    query parameter named "token" in the request URL.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://ensembledata.com/apis/docs:
  - Each request returns 100 followings. Use the cursor query parameter (integer,
    default 0) or page_token query parameter (string) to paginate through results.
    When more followings exist, the response includes a cursor value to use in the
    next request for fetching additional followings.
  - Each request returns 30 comments. Use the cursor query parameter (integer, default
    0) to paginate through results. When more than 30 comments exist, the response
    includes a cursor for the next request; continue until fewer than 30 comments
    are returned or no cursor is provided.
  - Each request returns 30 replies per page. Use the cursor query parameter (integer,
    default 0) to paginate through replies. When more replies exist beyond the current
    page, a cursor value is returned in the response for use in the next request to
    fetch additional replies.
  - Pagination uses `depth` and `cursor` query parameters. Depth 1 returns 10 results,
    depth N returns N * 10 results. Use the `start_cursor` parameter to fetch additional
    reels, with `chunk_size` controlling results per request.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach. The cursor query parameter is used to
    fetch subsequent pages of liked posts; pass the cursor value from the previous
    response to get the next set of results.
