pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.thumbtack.com/api-reference:
  - Pagination uses a "next" field in the response object containing the URL for the
    next page, and a "limit" parameter (default 0) controlling page size. Continue
    paginating by following the "next" URL until it is no longer present in the response.
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter (integer, 1-20, default 10) to specify
    the number of results returned per request. The response returns up to limit Review
    objects, but no next page token, cursor, or has_more field is documented, suggesting
    single-page results only.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, range 1-20, default 10) to control
    results per request, and beforeID (query parameter, optional, string) to retrieve
    records before a specified ID, with all records sorted by ID.
  - Pagination uses limit query parameter (integer, 1-20, default 10) to control results
    per page. The beforeID query parameter (string) enables cursor-based pagination
    by returning records before the provided ID. Response includes pagination object
    with next URL for the following page and limit value; when next is null, pagination
    is complete.
  - The Get Businesses endpoint uses cursor-based pagination with query parameters
    limit (integer, 1-20, default 20) to control page size and afterID (string) to
    specify the starting point. The response includes a pagination object with a next
    field containing the URL for the next page of results.
