notes:
- Document may be outdated as of December 2024.
- We cannot guarantee that no leak will ever happen, but we do our best to keep your
  data safe.
- This SLA is an information of intent, and does not engage Requirement Yogi in any
  way.
- Bugfixes and improvements are explicitly not part of any SLA, as software complexity
  makes it difficult to estimate the timeframe.
- The data that the app stores is subject to constant changes depending on features
  we develop.
- Personal data includes company name, contact names and emails.
- Retention period is as long as provided by Atlassian, and 10 years after the last
  event with the customer.
- Data provided by the user and customer includes logs of Confluence, database excerpts,
  files, configuration files.
- Data collected in production by the support to investigate issues.
- Data collected in license information to check the customers' support coverage.
- The cookies used by the main application do not have a configured 'SameSite' security
  attribute.
- During the audit, no critical or high vulnerabilities were found by the auditor.
- No injections identified (XSS, SQLi, SSTI, ...)
- No access control issues found.
- Malicious users could deliberately enter malicious Excel formulas in exportable
  data to execute arbitrary code on the workstations of people downloading them. A
  security warning will probably be displayed when Excel is opened, but most users
  ignore these warnings.
- Access to Swagger documentation without authentication
- No critical or high vulnerabilities were found by the auditor.
- The plugin Requirement Yogi Cloud is at a good level.
- We use the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire Lite (CAIQ-Lite) from
  the Cloud Security Alliance as a baseline mechanism to express our security posture.
- We don't have SOC2 or ISO 27001 reports, but we publish our last third-party audit.
- These terms of use apply to all our cloud products.
- Requirement Yogi may modify this Agreement from time to time.
- 'Data Residency supports 2 regions: Europe and USA.'
- Data is stored in AWS RDS with encryption enabled.
- Data may be collected and transferred outside of the EU.
- The search lets you filter requirements. You can use a specific syntax described
  below to filter requirements in the Search tab, Traceability tab, Diff tab and more.
- By default, only active requirements of the current space are displayed. You can
  use the URL to display deleted requirements or to search across spaces.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Requirement
  Yogi
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- There is no specific configuration.
- JIRA issues reflect the links at the time of creation.
- The most frequent problem is that the authentication to Jira/Confluence has timed
  out, and the user needs to authenticate again.
- Once you have reached this limit, it is not possible to create any more data in
  Requirement Yogi.
- It is voluntary to provide a consent.
- Read more about how we use cookies, how to avoid them, and how we process your personal
  data in our privacy policy.
- We are one of the rare vendors who communicate openly about the limitations, because
  we believe it helps managing expectations.
- Requirement Yogi is designed to help structure the free text and track the requirements,
  but we are not a good project planning tool, and you would need an external BI engine
  for the project planning part.
- App migration can take a long time to run, especially if you have thousands of pages.
- It’s always possible to transform non-migrated requirements later on with a manual
  transformation.
- Some RY macros are not migrated and cannot be transformed with the migration / transformation
  wizard.
- If some pages are restricted, it is not a blocking issue for you as a user because
  it is still possible to transform Server macros into Cloud macros manually.
- Verify especially jobs with a Failed status, so you can retry them or contact the
  support team.
- If there are restrictions on pages, which is very frequent, the app’s user can’t
  view and edit those pages.
- Requirement Yogi can’t recognise the format of the page because of the legacy editor.
- Confluence rejects the modification if it was performing too many modifications.
- 'There are some options which cannot be replaced on the Cloud: Count, Show all versions,
  Requirements from this space only, Limit, Sorting.'
- Spaces in the Cloud must have the same Space Key as the one in Data Center
- Cloud versions are limited to 50,000 requirements by default, 1,000,000 in certain
  conditions.
- The cloud editor seems to struggle with tables of over 100 requirements.
- 'Destructive step: It erases the target data and replaces it with the import.'
- Map automatically will try to lookup the values in the new database, and match the
  records.
- Import this data will attempt to import the current set of data.
- Voluntary consent for data collection.
- Administrators need to manually delete links to non-existing Jira issues.
- Voluntary consent required for data collection
- May collect information outside of the EU
- 'Not supported: Manually modifying backup files is not supported.'
- Backups that are exported through the UI are in CSV format.
- It’s hard-coded.
- It may collect information about your activities, your device/browser, and other
  information that Google has about you, and transfers them outside of the EU, mainly
  to the USA, where it is not as protected as within the EU.
- The import will delete orphan requirements.
- Direct SQL access is not supported
- Columns are uppercase (and may require quotes)
- Our unique keys are SPACEKEY - KEY - BASELINE (3 required items)
- Most databases assume that table names are lowercase
- There are risks of data loss when editing data in SQL. Please discuss with your
  system administrator and ensure you have a way to easily restore data if it is broken.
- These are the results of our performance tests. If your performance is sensitive
  and/or you are working on server sizing, it may be better that you perform performance
  tests on a staging instance yourself.
- Basically, once you have 50.000 requirements in the database, expect 20ms per requirement
  on the page when you save a page, and 20ms per requirement on view. This is not
  a commitment, as it depends on the machine, the set up, the configuration, the latency
  of the DB, the version of Confluence and Requirement Yogi.
- 'We recommend: 150 requirements per page, with a maximum of 400 (Confluence doesn''t
  support infinite pages anyway).'
- The default Global Limit is 12,000 and it should be the optimum for most people.
  If administrators notice that the Confluence is running slow, this might be where
  you need to check first.
- The expected number of dependencies, as explained on Limitations, is about 20. We
  don't have a hard limit, but please don't design a model with 1000-to-1 relationships,
  whether on requirements or on Jira issues.
- The size limit for baselines depends on the Global Limit and it is 12,000 requirements
  by default.
- Use queries that return fewer requirements, in the search, but more importantly
  in the dependency, traceability and coverage matrix.
- The dependency matrix and the coverage report can only be built by users who can
  export the space.
- Inform a subset of your users about the server limits and the tips to prevent a
  memory overflow; and restrict the export permissions to this group only.
- As a last resort, don't use the coverage and dependency matrixes. You can always
  explore Confluence's database schema and run the queries using an SQL tool.
- In 2.5.1, we've improved the behavior of the queue.
- Every 3 minutes, the job sends 3000 messages to Jira.
- Emails are only sent to watchers if the 'Send notifications' option was chosen in
  the Requirement Yogi administration, in Jira.
- All of this was measured with an efficient database.
- Global limit is configurable, with a default value of 12,000.
- UI limit is set to 2,000 (Global Limit / 6).
- Import limit is 4,000 (Global Limit / 3).
- The limit on pages is not implemented yet and will notify users above the recommended
  limit.
- Only PostgreSQL may require an action here, if you reach 2 billion records.
- At the latest, you can wait for users to raise the issue.
- If you want to act early, we suggest you act when the ID '2 billion' is generated
  in the table AO_32F7CE_AOINTEGRATION_QUEUE.
- The indexing v2 is the only one officially supported for Data Center.
- The performance of Confluence will be impacted by using the indexing v1.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- We require customers to move on to Indexing Engine v2.
- The comparison tool will show the differences in dependencies, but it will not apply
  them.
- For any information on support times and SLA Statement, please see the legal page
- Only space administrators can configure requirement types.
- Users have access to this screen in read-only mode, the only action they can perform
  is reset the sequences.
- We don't have calculations yet. You can't display the percentage of children in
  a given status, for example.
- We don't have filters.
- We may not have all Jira fields, but we've already developed renderers for Xray
  fields.
- External properties are not visible in the original page.
- They can be modified by anyone with edit permissions on the space.
- External properties are global to the instance.
- Our recommendation is not to use the refreeze, but always freeze requirements from
  the current version of requirements.
- The space key cannot be empty
- The baseline must be a valid number or empty
- If a requirement doesn’t exist in the target location, a warning will be shown,
  but others will be updated
- If none of the target requirements exist, the process will fail
- Building many reports on a single page may cause pages to be very slow.
- The Excel loop is useful when the file you want to import contains requirements
  you have defined with Requirement Yogi.
- You cannot edit those requirements directly in the app.
- The Excel file must remain attached to the page.
- It supports importing the key, the description, and the properties.
- Requirements in pages can mention a requirement of an Excel file, but it's not possible
  to put dependencies in Excel files.
- Requirement Yogi won't be able to rename and move requirements which are located
  in Scaffolding's live templates.
- In 4.4.0, the history needs to be activated manually.
- We recommend administrators to tune the settings according to the performance of
  their environment.
- The custom field only displays the links of one relationship, while the Requirement
  Yogi panel on Jira issues displays all relationships.
- The templates limit is 30 per space.
- You can't group more than 20 requirements in one Jira issue.
- We truncate the summary to 253 characters because this is the Jira limit.
- The left and right sidebars are paginated and will display 600 requirements per
  page.
- The NOT keyword doesn't work well yet.
- The user needs to have VIEW permissions on the spaces with requirements in Confluence.
- The user needs to have EDIT permissions on the issues with links, in Jira.
- The app has been tested for large instances
- The code has been proof-read and rearranged to avoid various possible locks or hanging
  threads
- The app will keep on living for long, even after Atlassian stops supporting Server
  instances in February 2024
- There is no configuration to perform. When it is enabled, every workflow change
  modifies the property on the requirements, on all spaces.
- The app is only compatible with Confluence Server, which has been deprecated in
  February 2024 by Atlassian.
- This extension allows uploading ReqIF files as attachments, and parsing them so
  that requirements are considered as local requirements.
- It doesn't 'support ReqIF' but it supports a subset of the specification, i.e. the
  definition of requirements and their properties.
- The feedback we have is that customers wish to update the requirements once the
  file is uploaded. But the file, as an attachment, can't be modified by Requirement
  Yogi. Therefore it has low popularity.
- Manage the limits of export in Confluence Administration → PSEA
- The Status and EDM macros will be displayed, but may not be indexed for the search
  as expected. Please test the search on those fields, and submit bug reports if you
  find anything.
- Speed is much better than the indexing V1, but not as good as pages without Scaffolding.
- If there are requirement definitions in 'Include' macro in Scaffolding, then it
  will behave as if the excerpt belonged to the page, i.e. it will appear as a duplicate
  definition.
- When a page is moved to another space or a requirement renamed, we cannot edit the
  contents of Scaffolding macros.
- You must have the permission to create a page in the space
- Use expand=all to get additional properties for requirements
- We attempt to provide updates for every LTS version of Confluence and Jira for 2
  years.
- 'Exceptions: We’ve succeeded to maintain compatibility with Confluence 7.19 LTS
  for 2.5 years.'
- It is now possible to set a global limit which is used everywhere.
- The default is 12,000 requirements in any batch, 2,000 by default in the UI, and
  4,000 for import.
- All tabs are visible to everyone
- Immediate synchronization is mandatory for everyone
- Administrators must add some credentials in the Requirement Yogi administration
  for the integration with Jira.
- Modifications in Jira will be performed under the username provided in the credentials,
  not under the name of the person who performed the change.
- Have you provided credentials in Confluence for Requirement Yogi, as explained in
  the Release 2.2?
- Cells aren't merged anymore after a non-merged column.
- The pagination is now correct.
- This release focuses on the improvement of the search with Russian characters in
  property names and values.
- We support UTF-8 in property names and values!
- Version 3.2.x is intended to provide a fallback option for customers who will stay
  on Confluence 7.4.x, for which Atlassian has dropped support (7.13.x is required).
- Version 2.5.19 is required in Confluence and Jira
- Compatibility with Confluence 7.4 was dropped, 7.13 is now required
- Dropped support for Internet Explorer
- A vulnerability was fixed (a dependency on DaisyDiff)
- Make use of PSEA 1.7, which added the ability to monitor and audit exports
- And our new logos
- 'IMPORTANT: If there is any screen that isn''t loading, please contact us in emergency.'
- Production environments may be different from our staging environments; If, as a
  system administrator, you notice anything weird, please notify us.
- Notable compatibility with Jira 10.2, Confluence 9.2, drop Jira 9.4 and Confluence
  7.19.
- We recommend waiting for two weeks before upgrading.
- Due to an indexation error creating wrong data, we recommend upgrading to 3.7.5,
  3.8.1 or above.
- Removal of RY 2.x database tables (which was only kept for the migration path)
- Removal of the deprecated feature 'Public descriptions'
- Removal of the RIL implementation in Jira (which was our storage in RY 1.x — only
  necessary for migrations)
- Indexation v2 is required
- No upgrade path from 2.x to 4.x
- No RIL migration in Jira
- Customers can still downgrade to Indexing V1, but please contact us and explain
  why your company can’t adopt the Indexing V2
- The comparison tool is only available in 4.1.1
- In 4.1.1, there is a small change to the JSON of the search and traceability REST
  APIs, mostly for baselined requirements.
- 'In 4.2.0, we’ve rewritten certains tabs in React (The search, the traceability
  matrix, the reports tab, the Excel tab, etc. - We didn’t modify the administration
  screens). There can be several risks for the first customers to upgrade:'
- We’ve reproduced all features. We may have missed some. Please reach out to our
  support if we missed anything!
- We’ve changed all URLs. If users are redirected to the old UI, we’ve kept the old
  screens available and there is a 'Old UI' label at the top-right. So, users will
  still benefit from a working screen, but by default they will be using the new ones.
- If you notice old URLs / features which are missing from the UI, please report them
  to us!
- In 4.3, we’ve upgraded all the plugins and reworked the communication between each
  others.
- Confluence 8.5 is end-of-life, please upgrade to Confluence 9.2 as per our Compatibility
  matrix.
- In 4.4.0 PUBLISHED, we’re adding the history of requirements.
- In 4.4.1 PLANNED, we plan to add the history for the other entities, and perhaps
  fix any bug reported in the previous release.
- In 4.4.2 FUTURE, we plan to make it possible to restore old versions of records
  (saved traceability matrices, etc. — everything except requirements).
- 'Confluence 10 and Jira 11 is a high-risk major release: The JDK 21 has changed
  base package names, which has impacts on practically every class.'
- We expect unexpected issues.
- Please test the upgrade on a staging instance.
- Please ensure all apps on your instance have a version available.
- We continue the support of Requirement Yogi through Atlassian’s ascend to the cloud
- We don't have baselines on the Cloud. It is a younger product with fewer features.
- It is more difficult to see the requirements on the Jira issues.
- We don't have an assisted migration path yet. Baselines, traceability matrixes,
  reports, and links in Jira will be lost and have to be re-created manually.
- Both Jira and Confluence should be in the Cloud, or on Data Center, but we can't
  "mix" requirements from both instances.
- ActiveObjects will recreate old tables automatically and we don't have control on
  this.
- If you have pages pointing from other spaces, then you will also have to modify
  the XML of those pages.
- Requirement Yogi can't do it automatically, because we don't have direct access
  to the DB, and API access will trigger all sorts of notifications (and slowness).
- Requirements in Paragraphs are indexed as default.
- Linear documents can be used to index titles as requirements.
- Permissions are cached for 15 minutes, you can wait or clear the cache if you are
  in a hurry.
- This feature allows you to find requirements with errors, and clean them up.
- Suggestions based on your input, other requirements in the page, and across your
  space and variants.
- It may take a couple of seconds for us to receive the Confluence Draft of the page,
  with the new requirement you just created.
- Requirement Yogi now supports data residency for both Requirement Yogi for Confluence
  and Requirement Yogi for Jira apps.
- 'Default region: If data residency is not configured, data is stored and processed
  in the EU region by default.'
- Currently, we do not support automatic migration of data between regions (e.g. from
  EU to US).
- We’re proud to say that our Cloud solution is now on par with our Confluence Data
  Center offering.
- Requirements are extracted from pages and exported to the entire space. We apply
  the space permissions for view, edit and admin.
- If you are configuring your Content-Security Policies, you cannot limit the loading
  of images or scripts to the domains above.
- You can export your reports in PDF by clicking on the three dots at the top-right
  of the page and on export.
- The coverage will not work, unless you have setup requirement types first.
- Variants are not designed for versioning. They are more like 'branches' in a version
  control system.
- If you want to compare modifications between sets of requirements.
- If you want to build reports to compare requirements present in different baselines
  or variants.
- If you want to compare the evolution of requirements over their versions.
- Change records are retained for 1 month during the BETA, ensuring users can reference
  past modifications when needed. After this period, it is automatically deleted.
  The retention period will be extended in the future.
- You can use variables to reuse the key generation in other documents.
- 'Available variables: {space.key}, {page.id}, {page.title.capitals}, {parent.page.title.capitals}.'
- Default values are not written inside the Confluence table, and the transformation
  wizard will not add them in the page.
- The transformation only adds new columns for Required Properties.
- You won't have as many options when transforming a vertical table, but we recognize
  that sometimes the choice is dictated by external factors. We suggest defining requirements
  in horizontal tables to fully benefit from the transformation wizard.
- This transformation is only usable on vertical tables, when other transformation
  rules would not work.
- When you import a document from Word, tables may not have proper headers.
- 'You can choose between three transformation modes: Add a header row, Replace the
  header row, Set the number of header rows.'
- Uses Google Analytics 4 to understand user behavior
- Supports various document formats similar to ISO and IEEE standards
- Allow to create new configuration or select an existing configuration.
- The name of the Linear Document configuration. By default it’s the page title.
- Describe the configuration
- This option, allow you show a text on page which indicate the page is processed
  as Linear Document.
- External properties are managed per instance.
- Regular users with page edit permissions can still add or modify external properties
  values on requirements, but cannot create a new type of external property.
- For now, only external properties can be imported.
- External properties can only be imported to requirements in the current space.
- External properties can only be imported to requirements in the current variant.
- We only support .XLS and .XLSX files.
- We limit the size of the spreadsheet to 10 MB.
- We limit the number of columns to 200 columns per spreadsheet.
- We limit the number of rows to 1000 rows per spreadsheet.
- It is absolutely not mandatory to use a Configuration macro, but it will help you
  customize your requirement detail with property and dependency names.
- You can ignore the numbered headings by passing a regular expression specifying
  the numbering format.
- Your first requirement does not have to be inside a table to be indexed as a parent,
  it can be a simple macro in a paragraph or title.
- This feature requires Requirement Yogi for Jira to be installed and configured.
- Only basic Jira fields (summary, description) are supported.
- This function is still in beta, as the underlying Atlassian API is still in preview.
- You cannot display test status, but you can display the status of Jira issues
- If you are unable to see the fields ‘Xray Revision’, ‘Xray Begin Date’ and ‘Xray
  End date’, it probably means the custom fields weren’t set up in your Jira environment.
- Integration allows importing documents and versions managed by Scroll as variants.
- Requires Scroll Documents to be enabled and Space Administrator privileges.
- The integration requires Zephyr Scale for Jira and Requirement Yogi for Jira plugins.
- Every user that wishes to see Zephyr Scale information in the traceability matrix
  will have to complete the API token creation step.
- We have been experiencing rate limit errors triggered by the Atlassian platform.
- This issue was caused by the migration from the Connect macro to Forge.
- We’re sharing a little more about our future roadmap.
- Migration of in-scope End-User Data between data residency supported locations is
  NOT POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT.
- Our apps are migrating from Connect API to Forge
- Minor Improvements in UI/UX and technical enhancements
- New AI Search feature allows AI to write search queries.
- This feature is still BETA , so feel free to contact us if you have questions and
  improvement requests!
- RY Champions require setup by Confluence instance administrator.
- We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how people use and purchase our product.
- It is now possible to export your traceability matrices in PDF, using the RY Report
  macro.

- Users are now able to index requirements in paragraph and headings.
- Users are now able to transform requirements in vertical tables.
- Requirements defined in vertical tables are now properly indexed with their properties.
- Users can now reset the transformation wizard without having to close or reload
  the page.
- Added a link to the template administration on the first screen of the transformation
  wizard.
- Leverage the power of Confluence rich text editor to define, annotate requirements
  and much more.
