  - 'A valid Access Token must be passed as an HTTP Authorization header with the
    Bearer scheme (capital "B"). The token is obtained through an OAuth2 flow, and
    once acquired, it should be included in every API request as "Authorization: Bearer
    {access_token}". HTTPS is required for all requests, and a valid Content-Type
    header must be specified (application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded).'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant type is used for API authentication. To obtain
    an access token, send a POST request to /oauth/access_token with form-encoded
    body parameters: grant_type set to "client_credentials", client_id, and client_secret.
    The response returns an access token valid for a specified duration in seconds.
    Use the access token to authenticate subsequent API requests. Access tokens have
    expiration times and there is a limit on concurrent active tokens per client.'
  - The Skills Base API uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant for authentication.
    To obtain an access token, send a POST request with client_id and client_secret
    parameters, which returns an access_token with token_type Bearer and expires_in
    (in seconds). Use the access token in subsequent API requests until a HTTP 403
    response is received, then request a new token using the same method. Refresh
    tokens are not issued or used with this implementation.
