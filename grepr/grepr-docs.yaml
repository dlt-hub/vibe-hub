- information_source; https://docs.grepr.ai/apis/:
  - OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow using Auth0 is required for Grepr REST API authentication.
    Obtain a client ID and client secret from Grepr support, use them to request an
    access token from Auth0, then include the token as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header of API requests. Access tokens are time-limited and organization-specific.
- information_source; https://docs.grepr.ai/apis/api-spec/:
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: grepr-api-key (sent as a header
    or parameter) and grepr-oidc (OpenID Connect). Exact header/parameter names and
    credential formats are not specified in the provided documentation.'
  - 'The API supports two authorization methods: grepr-api-key (API key authentication)
    and grepr-oidc (OIDC/OpenID Connect). Credentials should be sent as authorization
    headers, though the exact header name and format are not specified in this documentation
    excerpt.'
  - 'The API supports two authorization methods: grepr-api-key (an API key credential)
    or grepr-oidc (OpenID Connect). Credentials should be sent as authorization headers
    with requests to the S3 Data Warehouse integration endpoints.'
  - 'The API uses two authorization schemes: grepr-api-key (API key authentication)
    and grepr-oidc (OpenID Connect). Credentials must be sent as authorization headers
    with requests to protected endpoints like dataset operations and template management.

    in this documentation excerpt.'
