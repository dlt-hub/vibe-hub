auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/twinehealth.com/v7.78.1/openapi.json:
  - Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with client_credentials and refresh_token grant
    types. Client credentials are provided per organization and scoped to organization
    level, allowing full access to all patients and related data. Obtain tokens via
    POST /oauth/token endpoint using client_credentials or refresh_token grant type
    parameters.
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required for all API requests. To obtain
    a token, POST to /oauth/token with grant_type "client_credentials", client_id,
    and client_secret in the request body. Set Content-Type header to "application/vnd.api+json"
    (or "application/json" for older clients). The returned bearer token must be included
    in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/twinehealth.com/v7.78.1/openapi.json:
  - Cursor-based and offset-based pagination are both supported but cannot be mixed.
    For cursor-based paging, use query parameters page[limit] (page size) and page[after]
    (cursor value from previous response) to navigate; for offset-based, use page[size]
    and an offset parameter. Both methods return meta.count for resource count verification,
    and a next field indicates if more pages exist.
  - The Fitbit Plus API supports two pagination strategies for GET collection endpoints.
    Skip-based paging uses query parameters page[size] and page[number] with a links
    object in the response containing first, last, prev, and next page links. Cursor-based
    paging uses page[limit] and page[after] query parameters with a links object containing
    only the next page link if it exists, and is not subject to duplication when new
    resources are added.
