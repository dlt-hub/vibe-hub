auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-239/introduction.html:
  - Bearer token authentication using OAuth2. Access tokens are sent in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}". Tokens expire and can be refreshed using a
    refresh_token via POST to the /uaa/oauth/token endpoint with grant_type=refresh_token
    parameter. The refresh flow requires basic auth credentials (username and client
    secret) passed via the -u flag.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code grant flow is supported. Step 1: Direct user to SERVER/uaa/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENTID&response_type=code.
    Step 2: User logs in and is redirected to redirect_uri with authorization code
    parameter. Step 3: Exchange the code for an access token by POSTing to SERVER/uaa/oauth/token
    with grant_type=authorization_code, code=CODE, using HTTP Basic auth with client_id
    and client_secret (passed as -u client_id:secret in curl).'
  - OAuth2 password grant type authentication. Client credentials (clientId and secret)
    are sent via HTTP Basic Auth (-u flag), and user credentials (username and password)
    are sent as form data (grant_type=password, username, password) to the /uaa/oauth/token
    endpoint. The response includes access_token (bearer token) and refresh_token
    for subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://docs.dhis2.org/en/full/develop/dhis-core-version-master/developer-manual.html:
  - A client must authenticate using basic auth with username and password credentials
    supplied via the -u flag (e.g., -u admin:district). The credentials are sent in
    the Authorization header as base64-encoded "username:password" pairs. Additionally,
    the POST request to /api/synchronization/metadataPull requires Content-Type header
    set to text/plain and the metadata package URL as the request body payload.
  - 'API tokens are created via POST request with an empty JSON body and retrieved
    from the response. The token (format: d2pat_ prefix + Base64-encoded random bytes
    + CRC32 checksum) must be saved immediately as it is only shown once. Tokens are
    configured using PUT requests with Basic authentication (Authorization: Basic
    admin district header) to modify constraints like expiration and IP allowlists
    after creation.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.dhis2.org/en/full/develop/dhis-core-version-master/developer-manual.html:
  - Pagination for tracked entity searches is explained in the linked developer manual
    section. For paginated requests with non-zero KeyTrackedEntityMaxLimit, pageSize
    must not exceed this limit or an error is returned; if pageSize is less than or
    equal to the limit, pageSize is enforced.
  - Pagination is enabled by default with query parameter `page` (default 1) and `pageSize`
    (default 50). Response includes `pager` object with `page`, `pageCount`, `total`,
    and `pageSize` fields. Disable pagination by adding `paging=false` to the GET
    request.
  - Pagination uses a pager object in the response with page (current page number,
    default 1) and pageSize (items per page, default 2) fields. Request parameters
    page and pageSize control pagination, though their exact optionality and limits
    are not explicitly documented in the provided excerpt.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters `page` (page offset) and `pageSize`
    (default 50) to control results. By default, responses include a `pager` object
    and `entries` array; use `paging=false` to disable pagination and return a plain
    array, or `headless=true` to get a plain array while keeping paged results.
  - Pagination uses query parameter pageSize (optional, default 50) to control page
    size. Response includes pager object with page (current page number, 1-indexed),
    pageCount (total number of pages), total (total item count), and pageSize (items
    per page). Increment page parameter in subsequent requests until page equals pageCount.
