  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>". The API endpoint is fuse.com/api/v1/user/
    and returns user information including email, verification status, SSO and MFA
    settings when properly authenticated.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}". The authType parameter should be set to "bearer" in requests.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send your API token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN". Store the token in an environment variable
    rather than hardcoding it in flows to prevent accidental exposure.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. The HTTP request node is configured with
    authType set to "bearer", meaning an Authorization header with a Bearer token
    must be provided to authenticate requests to the FlowFuse API endpoint.
  - 'Every request to the FlowFuse API requires an API token sent in the Authorization
    header using Bearer authentication. Include the token as Authorization: Bearer
    <your_api_token> in the request headers.'
