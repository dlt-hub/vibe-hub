auth_info:
- information_source; https://vatlayer.com/documentation:
  - The API requires an access key passed as a query parameter named `access_key`.
    Include this parameter in all requests, for example `access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`
    in the query string.
  - 'The vatlayer API requires an access key for authentication. The access key must
    be passed as a query parameter named access_key in all API requests to endpoints
    like validate and rate. For example: http://apilayer.net/api/validate?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY&vat_number=VAT_NUMBER.
    You need to obtain a free or paid plan to get your access key.'
- information_source; https://vatlayer.com/faq:
  - Every registered user receives a personal Access Key that must be attached to
    API endpoint URLs as a query parameter named access_key to authenticate requests,
    for example http://apilayer.net/api/validate?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY. The Access
    Key can be found in the Account Dashboard and can be reset at any time.
