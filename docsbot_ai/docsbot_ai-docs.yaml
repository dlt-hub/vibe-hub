auth_info:
- information_source; https://docsbot.ai/documentation/developer/authentication:
  - 'API authentication uses an API key obtained from the API Keys section of the
    dashboard. For REST API endpoints, include the API key in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY. For WebSocket/streaming
    API endpoints, send the API key as an auth parameter in the JSON request body.
    The API key inherits all permissions from the user account that created it, including
    access to multiple teams if applicable. API keys are displayed only once when
    created and must be copied immediately; lost keys require creating a new one,
    which invalidates all previous keys.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {token}". API keys must be kept server-side and
    never exposed in client-side code. Example header: Authorization: Bearer 2e9fd6965890e80b9a7bb271900ab859e199a5778f851b73d97136d3495849ef'
- information_source; https://docsbot.ai/documentation/developer/source-api:
  - Authorization header with bearer token. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" where the token is a 64-character hex string provided by the
    API service.
