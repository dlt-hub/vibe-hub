notes:
- Customization Services provides the tools to instantly add customizations to Sage
  Intacct standard objects.
- You can subscribe to Customization Services by navigating to Company > Admin > Subscriptions.
- Platform Services must be enabled by Sage Intacct Customer Support.
- No developers should store sensitive information within Platform Services objects,
  custom fields, pages, URLs, and so forth.
- HTTP GET requests are not supported and will be blocked as of January 15, 2023.
  Use POST requests only.
- It is strongly recommended that you set up a Web Services user account in the Sage
  Intacct UI.
- Sage Intacct does not support special characters in the XML API.
- Make every effort to securely store your credentials and not hard code them.
- Using name/value pairs for picklist fields is not supported for custom picklists
  on standard objects.
- You can create an API Smart Event on the detail line, and the event criteria can
  include LINE_NO = 0.
- As of Sage Intacct's 2025 Release 1 (February 2025), the REST API is in General
  Availability (GA).
- Injections work in the context of Smart Events, but are not supported in Web Services
  XML API calls that originate outside the Sage Intacct UI.
- 'Warning: Components are copied to sandbox or Preview environments when you opt
  in to them.'
- Some objects like Vendor may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When a customization package is deleted in the Sage Intacct UI, everything in that
  package is deleted.
