auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.spark.re/:
  - API key authentication is required. A valid API key must be provided; requests
    without one will return a 401 Unauthorized status code.
  - API tokens are required and must be passed as a query parameter named "token"
    in all requests to the Spark.re API. Contact support@spark.re to obtain your API
    token for the environment you are using (production or demo).
  - 'Spark uses HTTP token authorization for API access. Submit an Authorization header
    with all requests in the format: Authorization: Token token="YOUR_API_KEY". The
    API key is generated from a Spark account under Settings -> API and should be
    kept secure on the server side only. API keys support granular permissions that
    should be restricted to only the minimum required access for your integration.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.spark.re/:
  - Pagination uses optional `per_page` query parameter (maximum 100, default not
    specified) to control results per page. Response includes Link header with rel="next"
    and rel="last" to navigate pages; construct next request using the URL from rel="next".
    Query parameters for filtering are preserved in pagination links.
  - The API uses Link header pagination. Responses include a Link header with URLs
    for previous, next, first, and last pages using rel="prev", rel="next", rel="first",
    and rel="last" attributes. The page query parameter controls which page to fetch.
    The optional per_page query parameter controls results per page with a maximum
    of 100; default is 25 results per page.
  - When a response from the API includes many results, Spark paginates by default
    returning 25 results per page. The documentation mentions response headers contain
    pagination information but the text is incomplete and does not specify the exact
    header names, request parameters for controlling page size or page number, or
    how to construct subsequent requests.
