notes:
- All previous image versions have been deprecated and are no longer supported.
- Support for viewing large scan reports on the platform UI will be expanded to Scan
  v2 report in a future release.
- Automatic sharing with teams is only available in the collection mode and only applies
  to new API collections that are created.
- Manage teams permission not shown on list of users
- Changing tagging on an API may trigger an unrelated error on the UI
- Data dictionary duplication does not yet duplicate the values in it.
- Scan customization rules may lead to no response codes being accepted.
- The permission to manage teams is not yet shown on the list of users in your organization,
  but you can view all permissions that a user has by clicking the permission column.
- Sometimes applying tags to or removing them from an API may trigger an unrelated
  error on failing to fetch the SQG approval report for the API.
- Duplicating a data dictionary does not yet duplicate the values in it.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Paying customers use IDE tokens to configure the IDE extension to access and authenticate
  to 42Crunch Platform.
- Free customers can use freemium tokens in their IDEs to configure using the more
  limited freemium service locally.
- API usage is on the rise. More and more, web and mobile applications are based on
  a UI that uses API operations to call to the backend servers for resources and data
  to provide the functions of the application.
- An API can belong to only one API collection at a time.
- The file size of your API should not exceed 10 MB.
- Inadequate data validation is the most common attack vector in API security.
- Do not run invasive scans against APIs that you do not own.
- API Scan does not support operations that require request bodies with the content
  type 'multipart/formData'.
- You must update your scan configuration before you can see the effect from some
  updates to API Scan.
- 'Large response bodies do not inflate the logs: response bodies over 8 KB are truncated.'
- API Firewall logs are located under /opt/guardian/logs in the file system of the
  API Firewall container.
- Transaction logs may include personally identifiable information that falls under
  GDPR regulations.
- Security automation is critical for business-grade API security.
- Tags are applied to individual APIs in an API collection.
- Tags can group APIs from multiple collections.
- Organization administrators can create SQGs and set the baseline for specific quality
  criteria that APIs in their organization must reach.
- Each organization automatically gets a default audit and scan SQGs out of the box.
- We recommend adding a dedicated category for SQGs.
- One size does not fit all, not even in API security.
- The maximum number of customization rules is 100.
- Users cannot change their username or the organization they belong to.
- Self-registering with a work email can be enabled or switched off completely.
- Always store all your tokens securely, for example, in Kubernetes Secrets, like
  other secrets you use!
- Treat tokens as you would other sensitive information, like your passwords.
- 42Crunch API Security Platform helps to align your APIs with many of the key security
  standards, regulations, and recommendations that abound in the modern service industries.
- The plugin checks the quality of the OpenAPI files present in your project.
- Make sure that you do not accidentally overwrite things in the API definition that
  you would like to keep.
- You must have a user account in 42Crunch Platform, and you need to create an API
  token with specific access rights (scopes) to run Security Audit from Postman.
- Switching the authentication checks off completely can be a big security risk down
  the line, and is not recommended.
- Specifying a sensitivity level affects how the audit score is calculated for your
  API.
- Local sensitivity levels override the global sensitivity.
- Tags must be unique within the category, but you can have same tags in multiple
  categories.
- Deleting a tag or category permanently removes it from 42Crunch Platform. This action
  cannot be undone.
- You must have an account in 42Crunch Platform that you can use for the integration.
- The integration plugin REST API Static Security Testing is available off-the-shelf
  for various CI/CD solutions.
- The plugin uses API tokens with specific access rights (scopes) to access 42Crunch
  Platform.
- By default when running on branch, the plugin uses the naming convention '<shortened-source-control-uri>
  Branch:<branch-name>' for the created API collection.
- The CI/CD plugin cannot apply tags from a category that only allows organization
  administrators to apply tags.
- Tags created through the CI/CD plugin do not have descriptions, but organization
  administrators can update the tags to add one.
- The discovered APIs are automatically uploaded to an API collection in 42Crunch
  Platform.
- If the quality of the APIs meets your criteria, the task or job ends with a success,
  if they do not, the task fails.
- The fail-on criteria you set in the CI/CD plugin are independent from the acceptance
  criteria defined in security quality gates (SQGs).
- Always store all your tokens securely, for example, in Kubernetes Secrets, like
  other secrets you use! Treat tokens as you would other sensitive information, like
  your passwords.
- The plugin will not block the pipeline from proceeding if X42C_IGNORE_FAILURES is
  set to true.
- The plugin will not fail the CI/CD job if X42C_IGNORE_NETWORK_ERRORS is set to true.
- You can define collection names for specific branches, tags, and pull requests using
  the property `collection_name` in the configuration file `42c-conf.yaml`.
- The job uploads all discovered OpenAPI definitions to the specified API collection
  in 42Crunch Platform.
- Make sure that your Jenkins version is the same or newer than the minimum compatible
  version.
- The plugin replaces all contents in the APIs in 42Crunch Platform with the contents
  of the API files in your repository.
- The default minimum audit score is 75.
- The default level of detail for logs is INFO.
- If using other plugins, ensure build variables match those plugins.
- The plugin cannot apply tags from a category that only allows organization administrators
  to apply tags.
- Configuring settings is entirely optional and not needed in most cases.
- Default settings are usually enough.
- API Firewall performs validations on incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- Log destination PLATFORM (alone or with STDOUT) is not suitable for firewall instances
  running in production environment due to the volume of logs produced. We recommend
  setting the log destination to FILES or STDOUT (or both) in production or for performance
  testing.
- Depending on the nature of your API, transaction logs could include personally identifiable
  information that falls under, for example, GDPR regulations.
- To avoid interleaving of different messages, any message larger than ${LOG_CONSOLE_SPLIT}
  (default `8K`) is split on multiple lines.
- If you are using any of the deprecated versions, make sure to update to a supported
  version.
- 'Scan configurations and tokens are specific to a scan version: you cannot run Scan
  v2 engine using a Scan v1 scan token, and vice versa.'
- Dynamic variable $random generates values for testing when schema is not available.
- $randomFromSchema requires schema to generate values based on defined types.
- API Scan generates suitable values using type-specific dynamic variables when no
  schema is available.
- Drift scan is a light-weight, non-invasive scan.
- Drift scan only sends GET requests.
- 'API Scan can have potential side effects: APIs can throw exceptions, fail, and
  data can be affected.'
- You must only run invasive scans, such as conformance scan and fuzzing requests,
  against APIs that you own, and only against non-production systems and non-production
  data! Do not run other scan types except the non-invasive drift scan in production
  environment!
- By default, the maximum size for a scan report is 20 MB.
- When running the scan on premises, you can increase the maximum report size up to
  128 MB.
- Large scan reports can take a long time to load in your browser.
- If the first value does not solve the timeout error, try running the cURL against
  your API more times to see if there is variation to the response time.
- If you run API Scan in 42Crunch Platform, you cannot change maximum scan report
  size.
- If you set the log level to `debug` when running Scan v2, all the values of all
  variables in your scan configuration are printed in the clear in the scan logs.
- The integration extension OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor is currently available for Microsoft
  Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Eclipse IDE.
- All API collections are private by default.
- Organization administrators have access to view and modify all API collections in
  their organization.
- Logs are only written in the IDE if the Audit runtime is set to `Platform`, AST
  binary does not write logs into the IDE.
- OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor can write logs only about the actions the extension itself
  performs, logs from other components it interacts with are not logged in the IDE.
- Mandatory tags must be applied for structural validity.
- IDE logs only record actions performed by the OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor.
- You must have an account in 42Crunch Platform that the SonarQube plugin can use
  to access Security Audit.
- Customization rules can be defined on platform level.
- Default rules apply to any APIs not tagged for a rule of the same type.
- All organizations get a data dictionary with formats that follow standard patterns.
- You cannot delete the standard data dictionary.
- User invitations are switched off by default.
- Auditors cannot receive any permissions.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'Invalid OpenAPI definition: You API definition has critical errors that are preventing
  API Scan from running.'
- 'Invalid scan configuration: The configuration you set up for the scan does not

- 'Scan cannot reach API endpoint: API Scan tried to run the scan but failed to reach
  the API endpoint you had selected for the scan.'
- 'Timeout: The scan took longer than the maximum scan duration (3600 seconds).'
- You see an error if a file with the same name exists during plugin run.
- The plugin does not delete or overwrite any summaries from previous runs, so if
  a file with the same name exists, you see an error.
- The plugin fails the build task if tags do not exist or settings prevent tags from
  being applied.
- If the CI/CD plugin cannot apply one or more of the tags you have listed, either
  because the category does not exist or the category settings prevent the plugin
  from applying using it or creating any missing tags, the plugin fails the build
  task.
- The plugin will replace all contents in the APIs in 42Crunch Platform with the contents
  of the API files in your repository.
- If the CI/CD plugin cannot apply one or more of the tags you have listed, the plugin
  fails the build task.
- '404: Not Found'
- '405: Method Not Allowed'
- '500: Internal Server Error'
- Error logs and access logs are written to the file system of the API Firewall container.
- Scan fails unless you specify all SCAN42C_SECURITY_ environment variables for them.
- 'User account not found: Check the username or email provided.'
- 'Invitation link expired: Regenerate a new invitation link.'
