In this guide, we'll set up a complete Spotify data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def spotify_ads_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "ad_accounts",
            "campaigns",
            "campaign_performance"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='spotify_ads_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='spotify_ads_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(spotify_ads_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from spotify_ads‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Ad Accounts: Endpoint to manage and get information about ad accounts.
- Campaigns: Endpoint to manage and get details about advertising campaigns.
- Campaign Performance: Endpoint to retrieve performance metrics for specific campaigns.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Spotify workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@spotify_ads-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Spotify support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:spotify_ads duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Spotify API, as specified in @spotify_ads-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "ad_accounts" and "campaigns" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in spotify_ads_pipeline.py and name the pipeline spotify_ads_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python spotify_ads_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Spotify uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, supporting a refresh token flow. Clients must provide the client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token to obtain an access token which is then used for API requests.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://developer.spotify.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python spotify_ads_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline spotify_ads load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset spotify_ads_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/spotify_ads.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline spotify_ads_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("spotify_ads_pipeline").dataset()
   # get ad_accounts table as Pandas frame
   data.ad_accounts.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Users must have a Spotify Developer application with Partner API access. The API requires a valid Spotify Ad Account ID for most endpoints. There are also specific error codes to handle, including 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, and 404 for non-existing resources.
