notes:
- Requires setup of Dropbox app in Developer console
- Access token must be obtained through OAuth flow for production usage
- The API is in active development and may change in the future.
- The API is fully covered in the LIB.
- To output the time of the execution at the end use --time flag.
- If you want to know how your execution happens in your console specify --debug flag.
- Job classes currently are not isolated and may interfere with each other.
- If another facilitator is created within the same JVM it’ll rewrite the global setting.
- The distributed overseer has optional constructor parameter `distributionPlanner`.
- When running all tests or testing DropBox related stuff, you may need to specify
  dropbox integration parameters.
- They are specified via environment variables DBX_TEST_CLIENT_ID and DBX_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN.
- WaveBeans uses metric approach to be monitored, and can be connected to a variety
  of monitoring systems, i.e. Prometheus.
- 'The previous approach works well while you’re running your jobs within one JVM:
  either in single-threaded or multi-threaded mode.'
