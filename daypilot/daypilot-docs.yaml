notes:
- Since version 2024.2.5957, the bubble will always show on hover if the bubble property
  is specified.
- DayPilot uses a special class for representing a DateTime value on the client side.
- The DayPilot.Date class reuses instances for the same points in time.
- DayPilot.Date allows direct comparison using >, <, ==, === operators.
- The values are normalized.
- The DayPilot.Date instances are immutable.
- Use .toDate() to get a Date object that stores the DayPilot.Date value as the GMT
  base.
- Use .toDateLocal() to get a Date object that stores the DayPilot.Date value as the
  local part.
- DayPilot.Date has the same methods as Date.
- Calling *toString()* without parameters will return the ISO 8601 representation
  of the input value.
- No time zone identifier is used.
- You can use *toString(format)* to get a locally formatted string.
- The controls work with an idealized continuous timezone.
- By calling *toDateLocal()* you say - I pretend the idealized timezone is my local
  timezone.
- Use *DayPilot.Date.parse(string, pattern, locale)* to read the value from a custom-formatted
  string.
- The original *DayPilot.Date* object is not modified (instances are immutable).
- 'There are two cases when the visible event box does not represent the full event
  duration: overnight events shown as two or more event parts, or if non-business
  hours are hidden.'
- Strings set using the text() method is automatically HTML-encoded to prevent XSS
  attacks
- Store custom properties in the tags object to avoid collision with future property
  names.
- The value should be a string in the CSS format for padding style.
- 'Default Value: null'
- The value should be a string in the CSS format for the border-radius style.
- If the value is a number (e.g. 10) it will be applied as a pixel value ("10px").
- The value should be a string in the CSS format for the padding style.
- Available since 2024.3.6180
