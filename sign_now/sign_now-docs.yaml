  : - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
      header as "Bearer {{access_token}}". The Content-Type header should be set to
      application/json.

  - SignNow uses OAuth2 with basic authorization for token acquisition. Make a POST
    request to /oauth2/token with an Authorization header containing "Basic" followed
    by your basic_authorization_token, and include your account email and password
    in the request body. The response provides an access_token and refresh_token for
    subsequent API requests.
  - The API supports two authentication methods. API key authentication uses an API
    key generated in the dashboard, passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {{API_key}}". Access token authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with a Basic Authorization
    Token obtained from the dashboard's OAuth 2.0 tab, then exchanged via a POST request
    to /oauth2/token for an access token to use in the Authorization header.
