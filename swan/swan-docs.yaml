    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" when making requests
    to the GraphQL endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.swan.io/developers:
  - The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Access tokens are required and differ
    between the Live and Sandbox environments. The OAuth 2.0 endpoint is located at
    https://oauth.swan.io/oauth2, while the GraphQL API endpoints are https://api.swan.io/sandbox-partner/graphql
    for Sandbox and a separate Live endpoint. Tokens and credentials are environment-specific
    and cannot be used across environments.

    access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" when making
    requests to the GraphQL endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/authentication/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication using OAuth 2.0 is required. Access tokens are provided
    in the HTTP Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer {access token}`. Two
    token types are available: user access tokens (valid for 3600 seconds, refreshable
    via refresh tokens, support all operations) and project access tokens (support
    queries and non-sensitive mutations only). User access tokens require the authorization
    code grant type. Expired tokens return HTTP 401 Unauthorized.'
