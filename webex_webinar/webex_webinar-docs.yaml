  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Access Token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" when making GET requests to retrieve
    file attachments. For unscannable files, add the query parameter allow=unscannable
    to the request URL.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization

- information_source; https://developer-usgov.webex.com/docs/compliance:
  - The Events API requires the `spark-compliance:events_read` OAuth scope for authorization.
    This scope must be added to your application through the Integrations/OAuth Guide,
    and users must be designated compliance officers in Webex Control Hub to access
    organization-wide events. The scope grants permission to read events for your
    user's organization via the Events API endpoint.
  - The Webex REST API uses OAuth2 scopes for authorization. Standard users have access
    only to their own account data, while compliance officers can be granted spark-compliance
    scopes (such as spark-compliance:messages_read, spark-compliance:messages_write,
    spark-compliance:memberships_write) to access and modify organization-wide data
    without needing to be a member of specific rooms. Scopes are added to apps through
    the Integrations/OAuth Guide, and authentication tokens must be authorized with
    the appropriate scope for each action.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer-usgov.webex.com/docs/compliance:
  - Use offset and limit query parameters to paginate events. The offset parameter
    specifies the starting position (default 0), and limit specifies the number of
    results per page. Navigate pages by incrementing offset by the limit value until
    no more results are returned.
