auth_info:
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415511936407-REST-API-Documentation:
  - The API requires an access_token request header obtained via POST user/login endpoint,
    which is mandatory for all requests except the login endpoint itself. Additionally,
    current_tenant header is required if the logged in user is a tenant user, and
    selected_tenant header can be used by system users to specify a particular tenant
    context.
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415492760599-User-APIs:
  - User credentials (userName and password) are sent in the request body as JSON
    fields for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the API returns an
    AccessToken in the response data field, which is used for subsequent authenticated
    requests. The token appears to be a base64-encoded string (e.g., "3AfY....yKg==")
    that should be included in subsequent API calls for authorization.
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415511948823-Export-APIs:
  - The API uses bearer token authentication via an access_token field. Include the
    access_token value obtained from authentication in the request body as a JSON
    field named "access_token". The current_tenant field should also be included in
    the request body, typically as an empty string if not applicable.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415511936407-REST-API-Documentation:
  - 'Based on the provided documentation excerpt, here is the pagination information:


    The GET fusion/{report_id}/{report_part_id}/(pageIndex)/(pageSize) endpoint uses
    path parameters pageIndex and pageSize to control pagination, where pageSize specifies
    the number of records per page and pageIndex specifies which page to retrieve.'
  - 'Based on the provided input, I can identify one pagination parameter:


    The GET report/reportPart/{report_part_id}/(report_id) endpoint accepts an optional
    query parameter page with a value to paginate results.


    However, the documentation excerpt does not provide details about response fields,
    stopping conditions, or how to construct subsequent requests, so the pagination
    mechanism is incompletely described.'
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415504641943-Data-Model-APIs:
  - Pagination uses pageIndex (1-based, required) and pageSize (required) as request
    parameters. Response includes pageIndex, pageSize, total (total records), skipItems,
    and isLastPage (boolean indicating final page); continue requesting with incremented
    pageIndex until isLastPage is true.
  - Request uses QuerySourcePagedRequest object with pagination parameters. Response
    returns PagedResult object containing results array and pagination metadata. Exact
    parameter and field names not specified in excerpt, refer to QuerySourcePagedRequest
    and PagedResult documentation for details.
- information_source; https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415492732439-Report-Designer-Details-APIs:
  - Pagination is used in the POST report/advancedSearch endpoint. The request body
    includes pageSize (default 10) and pageIndex (default 1) parameters to control
    pagination. The response returns pageIndex, pageSize, and total fields indicating
    the current page, page size, and total number of results, allowing clients to
    calculate subsequent pages.
