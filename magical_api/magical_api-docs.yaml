auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.magicalapi.com/docs/api-overview/overview:
  - MagicalAPI uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the request headers
    with the header name "api-key" set to your key value. API keys are available only
    with Pro plans and must be generated from the API Info section of your account
    panel.
- information_source; https://docs.magicalapi.com/docs/api-overview/authentication:
  - All requests to MagicalAPI require authentication using an API key passed as the
    "api-key" HTTP header. Every request must include the header "api-key" with your
    API key value and set "Content-type" to "application/json".
- information_source; https://docs.magicalapi.com/docs/api-overview/create-a-request:
  - API requests require an API key passed as the header api-key with the value YOUR-API-KEY.
    The key must be included in every request to the endpoint https://gw.magicalapi.com/profile-data
    as a required header parameter.
  - 'Send requests with an API key in the `api-key` header. Include `Content-Type:
    application/json` header. The API uses a request/polling pattern where you receive
    a `request_id` in the initial response and poll the same endpoint with that `request_id`
    to retrieve results.'
- information_source; https://docs.magicalapi.com/docs/resume-score/resume-score-request:
  - API key authentication is required. Send your API key in the `api-key` header
    with each request to the resume-score endpoint. The header name is `api-key` and
    you must provide your unique API key value as the header value.
