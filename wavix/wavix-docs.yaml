auth_info:
- information_source; https://wavix.com/api/rest/models/structures/document:
  - Authentication uses an API key passed as a query parameter. Add the `appid` query
    parameter to all API requests with your API key as the value, for example `GET
    https://api.wavix.com/v3/messages?appid=your_api_key`. Keep your API key confidential
    and revoke it immediately if compromised.
  - Wavix APIs use API key authentication. Include your API key as the appid query
    parameter in every request. Retrieve the API key from your Wavix account profile
    and append it to the request URL as ?appid=YOUR_API_KEY.
