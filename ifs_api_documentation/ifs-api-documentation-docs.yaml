- A percent (%) sign can be used in combination with a process code.
- Using % (percent sign) in a code part results in automatic posting taking place
  even though the code part has a null value.
- If (_%) is entered, automatic postings are created only for code parts that are
  not null.
- Set Concurrent Operations on the Work Center to Allowed – Group Start in Parallel.
- Each operation receives 3 hours of Labor Time (duration).
- Crew Size = 0.33, since the employee worked approximately 33% on each operation
  during those 3 hours.
- Man Hours = Labor Time × Crew Size = 3h × 0.33 ≈ 1h per operation.
- The work center option only applies if you actually group start the operations.
- If you start them one-by-one, the system will assume they are performed in parallel.
- To view all changes on a PR, check the document revision and look at the history
  tab.
- IFS reserves the right to change these rules and regulations from time to time at
  its sole discretion.
- There's no mention of the OAuth token timeout change to 3 minutes, which is important
  for integration purposes.
- Unfortunately it’s not possible to change the filename or the message body when
  using the Email functionality in the report dialog.
- Disabling the standard 'email' sent when you provide an email in the print dialog
  is possible but convoluted.
- Previously, printing the delivery note included all lines from the customer order.
- Now, only the line of the delivery action is printed.
- The Create Task Event option does not create a parent/child relationship between
  the created Task and the Event it is created from.
- Ad-hoc tasks do not populate the parentEvent property.
- Concurrent Operations must be set to Allowed – Group Start in Sequence to split
  time evenly.
- In practice, the Labor Time and Crew Size may not be split evenly — they depend
  on the remaining labor time or crew size defined for each operation.
- Users are reporting excessive browser CPU and memory usage with IFS Cloud.
- Some pages may cause high resource consumption.
- Some objects like Item may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Event Monitor disappears from home page after tab navigation
- It’s not possible to change the filename or the message body when using the Email
  functionality in the report dialog.

  PDF Archiver when they want to send the email.'
- This is a known issue in UPD 28, and it has already been resolved in App10 UPD 29.
- Project Code part values that identify the original code string. A percent (%) sign
  can be used in combination with a process code. Using % (percent sign) in a code
  part results in automatic posting taking place even though the code part has a null
  value. If (_%) is entered, automatic postings are created only for code parts that
  are not null.
- Consider using action as input for easier task creation.
- Users may encounter issues with permissions after importing configurations
- Token exchange or getting a token for the user 'on-behalf-of' via a confidential
  IAM Client seems to be disabled in Keycloak.

- Customer agreements may not reflect valid prices when base sales price site differs
  from sales site.

  site.
- Error was with OPERATION_STATUS field value in EQUIPMENT_OBJECT_TAB, some Service
  Objects had 'In Operation' value instead of 'IN_OPERATION' which seems to be the
  value required for this field.
- Once we set these values to null through a Migration Job, the API.method call was
  done and correct values were retrieved.
- Project Code part values that identify the original code string.
- Invoices are generated based on the completion status of scopes.
- Some work orders from other sites are also being replicated.
- Some users may have restricted access to certain folders.

- Create separate invoice previews for each scope irrespective of the scope status.
- We encountered issues with pods being OOMKilled (Out of Memory). The default memory
  settings were insufficient, even on servers with 128 GB of RAM.
- After analyzing memory usage via Grafana, we observed that only about 10% of the
  available memory was being utilized. To mitigate this, we manually added the addMemory
  directive to increase the memory allocation for the affected pods.
- User interacts with an Action to call a PL/SQL Command.
- Communication Method is nested under the SupplierHandling projection.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits or specific access requirements.
