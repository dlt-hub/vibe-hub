notes:
- The API token should be treated as sensitive as a password and must not be shared
  or distributed to untrusted parties.
- The token will remain valid as long as the account is in good standing or until
  it is regenerated.
- Scheduled allocations and logged time can be created over the API when full-day
  time off tasks exist on the same date, the task will still be saved in the database
  but it will not be visible on the UI.
- Creating a part-time time off task will not delete already existing tasks.
- All requests must be made over HTTPS.
- You can filter results by using query parameters.
