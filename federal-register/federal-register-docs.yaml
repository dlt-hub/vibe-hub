notes:
- This site displays a prototype of a 'Web 2.0' version of the daily Federal Register.
- These regulations are effective on April 8, 2024.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Data freshness and accuracy are critical.
- This final rule will improve the electronic exchange of health care data and streamline
  processes related to prior authorization.
- Policies will reduce overall payer and provider burden and improve patient access
  to health information.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Compliance dates for various APIs are finalized for 2027
- Compliance dates for MA organizations and state Medicaid and CHIP programs by January
  1, 2027.
- Compliance dates for Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities
  begin with the first rating period on or after January 1, 2027.
- All prior authorizations covered as a medical benefit must still meet the timeframe
  requirements established in this final rule.
- Requires impacted payers to make available, at a minimum, adjudicated claims, encounters
  with capitated providers, and clinical data.
- Payers must make those data available via the Patient Access API no later than 1
  business day after a claim is adjudicated.
- The Patient Access API works on a query mechanism and not a 'push.'
- Payers must make all required data available via the Patient Access API by January
  1, 2027.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Payers must report metrics to CMS on an annual basis about how patients use the
  Patient Access API.
- Metrics should be reported from the previous calendar year to CMS by March 31st
  of each year.
- Impacted payers must make information about prior authorization requests and decisions
  available via the Patient Access API beginning 2027.
- Access to information concerning beneficiaries must be restricted to persons who
  are subject to standards of confidentiality that are comparable to that of the state
  Medicaid agency.
- Beneficiaries are not 'outside sources,' and information is shared with an app through
  this API only if the beneficiary has verified their identity and authorized the
  app to receive information.
- Payers must implement and maintain a Provider Access API to make current patients'
  information available to in-network or enrolled providers.
- Providers should have access to a patient's health information without technological
  or financial barriers.
- Payers may communicate policies to new providers through existing channels.
- The final rule does not require payers to impose requirements to use the Provider
  Access API on their in-network or enrolled providers.
- Payers may choose to require providers to share certain data with them as part of
  their network/enrollment requirements.
- Payers must respond to a provider's request for patient data no later than 1 business
  day after the payer receives the request.
- Adherence to HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules is required for data shared via the
  Provider Access API.
- Payers must maintain an attribution process to associate patients with their providers.
- Data must be made available no later than one business day after conditions are
  met.
- Payers must establish a process for patients to opt out of data sharing via the
  Provider Access API.
- Data sharing by default unless a patient opts out.
- Payers should make efforts to ensure their patients or their personal representatives
  have the opportunity to opt out of data sharing under the Provider Access API policy
  and should be accommodated accordingly.
- Each impacted payer must provide information about opt out rights and instructions
  both for opting out and for opting in after previously opting out, in non-technical,
  simple, and easy-to-understand language, before the first date on which the payer
  makes patient information available through the Provider Access API, at the time
  of enrollment and annually thereafter.
- Resources must be available no later than one week after the start of coverage.
- The payer authenticates the identity of the provider that requests access and attributes
  the patient to the provider under the required attribution process
- The patient does not opt out of the Provider Access API
- Disclosure of the data is not prohibited by law
- Impacted payers are required to make prior authorization information available no
  later than 1 business day after the payer receives a prior authorization request
- Impacted payers must establish and maintain an attribution process to associate
  patients with their in-network or enrolled providers
- Compliance dates established in 2027 for impacted payers.
- Payers must implement and maintain a Payer-to-Payer API conformant with the FHIR
  standard.
- Payer to payer data exchange is legally required under this final rule.
- Five years of data exchange is mandated from the date of service.
- Denied claims may contain important information about a patient.
- Payers have formatted necessary data elements for interoperability through FHIR
  APIs.
- Provider remittances and patient cost-sharing information are excluded from the
  Payer-to-Payer API.
- Payers must begin the process of collecting previous/concurrent payer information
  and opt in no later than 1 week after the start of coverage.
- Payers are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to engage with patients to gather
  their permission and identify any previous/concurrent payer(s).
- Each new payer will be responsible for gathering permission through an opt in process
  before requesting data from any previous or concurrent payer.
- The patient's opt in election is valid indefinitely with that payer unless the patient
  decides to withdraw their permission at a later time.
- We proposed to require impacted payers to request a patient's data from their previous/concurrent
  payer(s) no later than 1 week after the start of coverage.
- We agree with commenters that state Medicaid and CHIP agencies are the logical entity
  to hold Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries' permission for payer to payer data exchange.
- Payers are required to request patient information from previous and concurrent
  payers if the conditions in the rule are met.
- We encourage payers to establish connections and perform testing with other payers
  before the compliance dates for the Payer-to-Payer API.
- Impacted payers must respond within 1 business day to a request for patient data
  from a concurrent payer.
- Payers are only responsible for maintaining their own records, including that which
  has been received from another payer.
- Payers must incorporate patient data into the appropriate place where they maintain
  that type of information.
- The state Medicaid or CHIP agency is responsible for obtaining the required permission
  for data exchange.
- Impact payers must implement and maintain a Payer-to-Payer API beginning in 2027.
- Requiring the data described in this section to be shared via the Payer-to-Payer
  API is consistent with states' requirements to provide safeguards meeting certain
  requirements to share these data.
- When state Medicaid agencies share medical records or any other health or enrollment
  information pertaining to individual beneficiaries, they must comply with the requirements
  of 42 CFR part 431, subpart F.
- The Prior Authorization API is intended to streamline the prior authorization process.
- The Prior Authorization API aims to improve the prior authorization process through
  automation and real-time responses.
- Payers are required to implement a Prior Authorization API that allows a provider
  to query a payer's system to determine whether a prior authorization is required.
- The Prior Authorization API can support the submission of a prior authorization
  request itself.
- This final rule does not address health care attachments.
- The requirements include implementation of a Prior Authorization API that can provide
  responses about whether an authorization request has been approved (and for how
  long) or denied, a specific reason for the denial, or request more information from
  the provider to support the prior authorization.
- Denial information must be sufficiently specific to enable a provider to understand
  why a prior authorization has been denied and what actions must be taken to re-submit
  or appeal.
- Nothing in this final rule will limit the existing enrollee notification requirements
  for Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities.
- Impacted payers may be required to provide this information in languages other than
  English.
- 'Finalized timeframes for prior authorization decisions: 72 hours for expedited
  requests, 7 calendar days for standard requests, beginning January 1, 2026.'
- The timeframe for standard prior authorization requests and expedited organization
  determinations for certain programs may be extended for either 14 or 15 days for
  reasons specified and permitted under existing or new policies.
- New requirements would apply to prior authorization decisions beginning January
  1, 2026.
- Timely prior authorization decisions are important patient protections.
- CHIP patients should be afforded the same decision timeframes as Medicaid and Medicare
  patients.
- Payers are required to post prior authorization metrics on their public websites.
- Impacted payers must implement and maintain a Prior Authorization API beginning
  2027
- MA organizations must report prior authorization metrics at the contract level
- The Prior Authorization API will enable a provider to determine if a prior authorization
  is required electronically, in real-time and what the documentation requirements
  are regarding such requests.
