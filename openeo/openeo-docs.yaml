auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.openeo.org/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header (format: "Authorization: Bearer <token>"). The API supports optional pagination
    via offset, level, and limit query parameters, where offset is required to be
    implemented by backends.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header when making requests to this endpoint.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header using the format "Bearer <token>", where the token is base64-encoded in
    the form "username:password" (e.g., "Bearer basic//ZXhhbXBsZTpleGFtcGxl"). The
    token must be included with every request.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}".'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <token>". The API returns 401 if authorization is required or 403 if
    authorization fails.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.openeo.org/:
  - Pagination for logs uses an optional offset parameter (required to implement)
    that clients should use when requesting consecutively to retrieve only new entries
    not previously received. The documentation does not specify response fields for
    pagination state, total count, or how to determine when all logs have been retrieved.
  - Pagination is enabled via the optional `limit` query parameter (integer >= 1),
    which specifies the maximum number of elements in the `services` array. If `limit`
    is not provided, all elements are returned. The response includes a `links` array
    with pagination links using predefined `rel` types for browsing pages; clients
    should follow these links to navigate pagination.
  - Pagination is implemented using Link headers with rel relation types. The links
    array itself must not be paginated. Required rel types include next (link to next
    page, except on last page) and optional prev (link to previous page, except on
    first page), first (link to first page, except on first page), and last (link
    to last page, except on last page).
  - Pagination is optional and controlled by the limit query parameter (integer >=
    1), which specifies the maximum number of elements in arrays. If limit is not
    provided, all elements are returned. The response must include a links array with
    rel types for browsing pagination (e.g., next, previous), which clients should
    use to navigate pages. Back-ends can implement any pagination technique (page-based,
    offset-based, token-based).
  - 'Pagination uses Link header relations: next (required on all pages except last),
    prev (optional except first page), first (optional except first page), and last
    (optional except last page). Follow the links in the Link header to navigate between
    pages, and stop when the next relation is absent.'
