notes:
- The maximum limit for participants to return is 100.
- Triggering referrals is recommended using the /POST Trigger Referral by Participant
  ID endpoint.
- Your campaign must have a custom 'From' email address in order for email invites
  to be sent out.
- GrowSurf can be fully implemented in a few days or less.
- Many GrowSurf customers get up and running within a day.
- Your campaign-specific GrowSurf Universal Code will work on any URL that shares
  the same origin as the Share URL or Signup URL that you entered in the Installation
  step of the Campaign Editor.
- A very common issue with using Google Tag Manager is that common adblockers will
  prevent it from loading in the browser.
- Your Participant Auth Secret holds privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do
  not share your Participant Auth Secret in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub,
  Bitbucket, client code, etc.
- You must have the GrowSurf Universal Code installed on the same webpage that embeddable
  elements are on.
- For troubleshooting auth states, please view the support article.
- This element will only be displayed to signed-in participants.
- Ensure to set up Webhooks for reward fulfillment.
- Participant authentication is required for referral links to display.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Growsurf
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in GrowSurf
- To test in a sandbox/development environment, create two different campaigns for
  development and production environments.

  GrowSurf.
- A 401 error will be returned if the campaign has participant authentication enabled
  and there is no authentication cookie present on the participant's browser.

- The script will display progress and status updates for each deletion operation
- This Participant Object contains detailed information about a campaign participant.
- All requests should be made using HTTPS.
- Data is returned in JSON.
- You can add a total of 5 webhooks per campaign.
- For security purposes, you can add a webhook secret to limit requests sent to your
  webhook endpoint to those only coming from GrowSurf.
- Once your campaign has a webhook secret, a signature GrowSurf-Signature will be
  included in the header of all outgoing requests to your webhook endpoint.
- To see the different sample data from webhook request payloads, see Events
- For double-sided rewards, two events will be sent for both referrer and referee.
- 'If you have manual reward approval enabled for your campaign, events will be sent
  twice: when the reward is pending approval and when the reward is approved.'
- All metadata keys will be converted to camelCase.
- Do not store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, such
  as credit cards and social security numbers) as metadata within GrowSurf, as metadata
  rewards are accessible from the JavaScript SDK.
