notes:
- Requests are sent using HTTPS requests; JSON is the data format for both input and
  responses.
- Responses are asynchronous and are sent using HTTPS requests from the payment gateway
  to the client.
- Transactions are sent in batches to efficiently support bulk-payment operations.
- Every API request must contain a valid private key signature.
- Requests to the API must include a unique client ID and request ID.
- Final status updates for transactions can be retrieved from the callback endpoint.
- Configuring the client with a callback URL is recommended for production environments
  since it prevents transactions from being processed without the client being informed.
- Keys are required for all clients, whether production or development/test. Keys
  must be at least 256 bits in length.
- Requests to the payment gateway are signed using public-key cryptography.
- Public keys must be encoded in PEM format when uploading to the payment gateway's
  key management interface.
- Do not include your private key in the request body!
- The gateway's current key ID is YvZ4YObUo9A.
- Payments made using the SWIFT provider have their own field length and character
  set restrictions.
- The SWIFT provider will accept at most 2 decimal places for all currencies.
- Field length restrictions may vary by recipient market.
- Some ACH schemes use daily payment cycles, resulting in a delay between payment
  initiation and execution.
- Other ACH schemes have instant settlement, providing real-time feedback on payment
  status.
- Not all endpoints can be used to interact with payments initiated using the ACH
  provider.
- Polling schedule recommended for transaction retrieval.
- startTime parameter needed for FX Settlements.
- Transaction records include details such as transactionId, transactionType, statusCode,
  and more.
