notes:
- This property is used for integration with CM systems.
- Control the number of redirects to follow and get the last URL of a redirect.
- Clean up response HTML with built-in HTML Tidy for easy parsing as XML.
- The UnPack() method will first remove all files from the destination folder.
- This component was not designed to work with huge archives.
- This component is designed for 32-bit operating systems.
- Base64 is not encryption, it is used to package data for storage or transmission.
- XStandard runs in browser-based content management solutions.
- XStandard runs in desktop-based content management solutions.
- Supports most CSS 2.1 selectors
- XStandard makes applying the correct CSS quick and easy
- The advantages of using Web Services
- A configurable and customizable toolbar
- Imports third-party data
- Supports drag & drop of images directly into the editor, and file browsing
- Inserts custom tags that add semantic meaning to text and objects
- Supports the distinction between data and layout tables
- Distinguishes between decorative and informative images
- Includes a unique 'Screen Reader Preview'
- Storing images used by content-managed documents in separate folders solves many
  of the problems caused by using a single 'images' folder.
- This reference is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict / XHTML 1.1. With the exception of ruby
  elements which are part of XHTML 1.1, the two specifications are almost identical
  from a markup perspective.
- When using the XHTML 1.0 Strict DOCTYPE, the attribute lang may be used instead
  of the attribute xml:lang.
- When using the XHTML 1.0 Strict DOCTYPE, the attribute name may be used instead
  of the attribute id for elements a and map.
- Better support for Microsoft-only intranet environments. Some intranets use proxies
  and NTLM authentication. Setting ProxySetting param tag to value platform should
  automatically pass NTLM authentication over the network without prompting for a
  username/password.
- 'To enable caching, set the following param tag: <param name="EnableCache" value="yes"
  />'
- The editor automatically ensures that the cache does not exceed 200 files or 5 MB.
- Be sure to save your localization XML file in Unicode (UTF-16 or UTF-8).
- To enable the heartbeat, create a Web page in the same development environment that
  your CMS is written in (ASP, PHP, etc.) and put the Web page in the same folder
  with the rest of your CMS Web pages.
- Add a line of code to the Web page in order to trigger the scripting engine. This
  can be as simple as writing out the current date.
- To set the length of the pulse interval, use the following <param> tag where the
  value is measured in seconds.
- By default, content within markers is displayed inside a dashed outline. To remove
  the dashed outline, set the CSS `border` to 'none'.
- XStandard removes inline elements that have no content.
- Styles are not CSS rules. CSS is often applied to the markup to create formatting.
- Styles can be grouped for ease of use.
