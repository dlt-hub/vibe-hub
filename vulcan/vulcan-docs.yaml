notes:
- The full repository is very large, and some ISPs appear to have trouble providing
  a robust connection to github while the clone is being made.
- HLSL is considered a first class shading language for Vulkan.
- DXC is the reference HLSL to SPIR-V compiler.
- Vulkan SDK version for macOS internally uses MoltenVK.
- 'On Xcode toolbar go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme..., and in the Arguments
  tab add the two following environment variables: VK_ICD_FILENAMES = vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json,
  VK_LAYER_PATH = vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d.'
- For CLion, add VULKAN_SDK=<fullPathToVulkanSDK> in the environment variable settings.
- Vulkan is targeted at programmers enthusiastic about high performance computer graphics.
- The tutorial will not assume knowledge of OpenGL or Direct3D concepts.
