notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- All records generated by Landano are stored as Cardano NFTs with supporting documentation
  packages provided on the permissionless Arweave storage network.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires a Blockfrost API key (testnet or mainnet)
- No. The current version of the plugin only supports Blockfrost for querying and
  submitting transactions to the Cardano blockchain.
- Yes. The plugin supports the Preprod and Preview testnets.
