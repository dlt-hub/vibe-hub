notes:
- Búsqueda de datos ASF es una herramienta de búsqueda fácil de usar para encontrar
  datos SAR
- All jobs submitted to HyP3, whether via web access or programmatic access, are publicly
  visible.
- On Demand products are available for 14 days after they have been processed.
- A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is required to generate each of the On Demand products
  offered by ASF.
- Currently, only scenes with beam mode IW are eligible for On Demand processing.
- Event monitoring is triggered automatically by existing hazard alert systems.
- Beginning on May 21, 2025, we will implement a 30-second timeout on SearchAPI queries.
- An authenticated session is generally required.
- If not using .netrc credentials, that session should be passed to whichever download
  method is being called.
- Requires authentication before downloading products.
- Use to check if results returned from asf_search.search() are incomplete (this can
  happen if an error occurs while querying CMR)
- Search results are returned as an ASFSearchResults object, a subclass of User List.
- When searching for multiple products, it's faster to search all products at once.
- It is generally preferred to collapse many small queries into fewer large queries.
- Granule searches can be 1:many, whereas a product search will always be 1:1.
- Search results are returned as an ASFSearchResults object.
- Using .netrc credentials is the preferred method for authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requests will attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL’s hostname
  from your .netrc file.
- Downloading data, and accessing some data, requires an authenticated session with
  Earthdata Login.
- Recommended way to perform large, long-running searches is to use search_generator()
  to yield CMR results page by page.
- Base ASF Exception, not intended for direct use
- Base search-related Exception
- Raise when SearchAPI returns a 4xx error
- Raise when SearchAPI returns a 5xx error
- Raise when SearchAPI returns an unknown error
- Raise when baseline related errors occur
- Base download-related Exception
- Any errors will be returned in JSON format.
- URL encoding is required for spaces and parentheses in queries.
- Rate limitation is per IP and is currently 250 queries per minute.
- Upon hitting the limit, further queries will yield a HTTP 429 with an error message.
- GeoJSON is the preferred Search API output format.
- Data is free and easy to download in several formats.
- Projected to UTM coordinates
- Hi-Res Terrain Corrected products are 12.5 meter resolution
- Low-Res Terrain Corrected products are 30 meter resolution
- Caution on interpreting the data!
- The unfiltered displacement layer from the DISP-S1 product will not reflect what
  is visualized in the portal.
- All of the SARVIEWS products available in Vertex are freely available for download
  and use without restrictions.
- On Demand products are retained and available to download for two weeks (14 days)
  after processing.
- If you do not already have one, create a free Earthdata Login account.
- Log in by clicking the Sign in icon in the top right of the window. Use your Earthdata
  Login username and password.
- Active Events Only switch displays only active events.
- Jobs expire 14 days after submission.
- Some keywords and endpoints will accept a POST request.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: No authorization token provided'
- Raises an asf_search.exceptions.ASFSearchError if the results are incomplete
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'HTTP 429: Rate limited, please reduce your request rate to 250/minute or less'
- '401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid Earthdata username/password'
- 'HTTP 429: Rate limit exceeded'
- 'Timeseries Service Error: Selected area is outside the dataset coverage'
- 'HTTP 429: Rate limit exceeded.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Special characters in Earthdata password'
