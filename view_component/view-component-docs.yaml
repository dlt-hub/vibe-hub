notes:
- Content passed to a ViewComponent as a block is captured and assigned to the content
  accessor.
- Slots allow the rendering of multiple blocks of content.
- Lambda slots can access state from the parent ViewComponent.
- Use ViewComponents in place of partials.
- Prefer using slots for providing markup to components.
- Content can’t be passed to a component via a block in controllers. Instead, use
  with_content.
- Requires non-EOL Rails (>= 7.1.0) and Ruby (>= 3.2.0)
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Run into an issue with this release? Let us know
- As of version 4, ViewComponent is considered feature-complete.
- The largest consequence of this change is that we’ll need to deprecate the old setter
  usage in favor of the new setter API.
- ViewComponent provides a way to isolate common UI patterns for reuse, helping to
  improve the quality and consistency of Rails applications.
- Split the slots API into a getter and setter.
- New API for setting slots includes `with_#{slot_name}`.
- Avoid inheritance in ViewComponents to reduce confusion.
- Prefer ViewComponents over partials and HTML-generating helpers.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
  an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
- Polymorphic slots introduced in v3.0.0
errors:

- 'RedefinedSlotError: COMPONENT declares the SLOT_NAME slot multiple times. To fix
