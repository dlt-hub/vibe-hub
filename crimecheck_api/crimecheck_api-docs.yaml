auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidoc.crimecheck.in/crime-check-api.html:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Pass the API key using HTTP Basic Authentication
    with the key as username and empty string as password (format: `-u ''api_key:''`).
    The API key should be included in the Authorization header as Base64-encoded credentials.'
  - 'API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Send the API key as the username
    with an empty password in the Authorization header (format: `username:password`
    encoded in base64), or use curl''s `-u ''test_apikey:''` flag. The API key is
    `test_apikey` in the provided example.'
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with an API key. The username is the API key
    (e.g., 'test_apikey') and the password is left empty. In Python, pass auth=('your_apikey',
    '') to the requests library, or set the Authorization header to 'Basic ' + base64_encode('apikey:').
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with your API key as the username and an
    empty password. Alternatively, for cross-origin requests, use the Authorization
    header with the format `Authorization: test_apikey`. Keep your API key secret
    and do not share it publicly.'
  - Basic authentication is required using a username and password sent in the Authorization
    header. The username is the API key (e.g. "test_apikey") and the password field
    is left empty. Send credentials via HTTP Basic Auth with the request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidoc.crimecheck.in/crime-check-api.html:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter passed in the request body or query string.
    Pass page=2 to retrieve the second page of results. The documentation does not
    specify response fields indicating total pages, next page availability, or when
    to stop paginating.
  - 'The API response includes pagination fields: page (current page number, default
    1), resultsPerPage (items per page, default 10), totalResult, and totalHits. To
    paginate, include a page parameter in the request body to retrieve different pages;
    continue requesting with incremented page numbers until totalResult is exhausted
    or no more results are returned.'
  - The API uses a page parameter passed in the POST request body to paginate results.
    The example shows page=2, indicating page-based pagination where clients specify
    the desired page number.
