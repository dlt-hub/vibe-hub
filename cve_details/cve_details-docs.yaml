  - 'All API calls require Bearer access tokens sent in the Authorization header.
    Access tokens are created and managed through the user account dashboard at https://www.cvedetails.com/user/access-token/list,
    displayed only once upon creation, and must be saved by the user. The Authorization
    header format is "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN". API access requires
    an active subscription (Business or Enterprise plans typically include it). Rate
    limiting is applied per minute based on subscription plan, with responses returning
    HTTP 429 when limits are exceeded.'
