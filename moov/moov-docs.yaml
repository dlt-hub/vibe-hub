notes:
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- If your website used Moov.js prior to May 14, 2024, please review your codebase
  for the url https://js.moov.io/v1, and update the url to https://js.moov.io/v1?min=v0.6.12.
- Moov.js v0.6.12 guarantees a seamless transition to all future Moov.js releases.
- When making calls from the browser, you'll need to specify scopes when generating
  an access token.
- An individual with administrator or developer permissions is required to take the
  actions laid out in this guide.
- Webhooks allow applications to react to state changes in a platform in real time.
- API keys required for server side integrations, while client-side integrations use
  OAuth2 access tokens.
- This SDK requires an API key.
- Moov will send the terms of service platform agreement as part of the onboarding
  process through the Dashboard.
- Moov offers a variety of integration options to get started.
- Everyone with a Moov account must agree to and accept the terms of service before
  using Moov.
- Moov implements rate limiting for security and performance optimization.
- Currently limit the number of requests by any given IP address to 40 requests per
  second per account ID.
- Test accounts are limited to 10 requests per second per account ID.
- Moov follows the OAuth2 protocol authentication flow.
