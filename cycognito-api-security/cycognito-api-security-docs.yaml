notes:
- The OWASP API Security Top 10 list provides guidelines for securing APIs.
- 'Use API gateways with security policies: Deploy API gateways to enforce security
  policies like authentication, rate limiting, and data encryption.'
- 'Implement mutual TLS (mTLS): While standard TLS encrypts communication, mutual
  TLS adds an additional layer of security by requiring both client and server to
  authenticate each other.'
- 'Employ runtime protection mechanisms: Implement runtime application self-protection
  (RASP) solutions that can monitor and protect APIs in real-time.'
- 'Secure API documentation: Restrict access to API documentation to only those who
  need it.'
- 'Monitor for shadow APIs: Use tools that can detect shadow APIs—undocumented or
  forgotten APIs that still reside in your environment.'
- Requires setup of connected app in CyCognito
- Limitations may exist based on user permissions
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in CyCognito
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token.
- Purchasing all three modules empowers companies to take full control of their attack
  surface.
- Automates the first phase of offensive cyber operation with deep reconnaissance
  and active security testing.
- CAASM integrations lack the context required to efficiently remediate risks across
  externally exposed assets.
- CyCognito delivers hundreds of elements of high-performance context.
- Adopting an outside-in approach gives you perspective on your cybersecurity risk.
- CyCognito provides high-confidence insight into risk that allows you to plan for
  the upcoming event as early as possible around areas such as tool consolidation,
  testing schedules, and team focus.
- Clear remediation steps, with evidence, allow you to proactively communicate issues
  in the candidate’s environment.
- Continuous security monitoring is essential for maintaining visibility on the evolving
  attack surface.
- Most IT security teams face budget constraints yet still need to manage external
  risk.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- CyCognito uses natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and a graph
  data model to automatically map the organization and identify subsidiaries
- CyCognito requires zero-input, zero-seeds, zero configuration, and zero onboarding.
- Cycognito seamlessly discovers all external assets, even those that are hidden or
  unregistered, providing security teams with comprehensive visibility.
- API provides access to CVE data.
- Ensure proper handling of high-severity vulnerabilities.
- Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3,
  and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do
  not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.
- From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.
- From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has
  been completely removed.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The CyCognito platform automatically identifies violations for major security and
  compliance frameworks such as NIST, CIS and PCI-DSS.
- Continuous monitoring and testing addresses the new rapid response timelines.
- EASM provides a systematic approach to safeguarding an organization's external attack
  surface by continuously identifying, analyzing, and addressing vulnerabilities and
  risks.
- The platform provides continuous visibility necessary to understand and truly know
  your attack surface.
- Data breaches are a potential risk for modern organizations — and the wider your
  attack surface, the higher your organization's risk of a data breach.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup.
- Pagination available for data retrieval.
- API requires setup of connected app in CyCognito
- Requires setup of connected app in CyCognito.
- Monitor the IT security risk of subsidiaries.
- 73% of manufacturers‘ externally exposed web apps lack basic protections like HTTPS
  or a WAF
- Manufacturers face distinct cybersecurity risks.
- Our Website is not meant to be used by or for persons under 18; as such, we do not
  knowingly collect Personal Data from minors younger than 18.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented.
- Regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments,
  is essential.
- CyCognito automatically identifies shadow external-facing assets in Azure, AWS,
  and GCP across all organizational units and brands.
- Ensure proper OAuth setup for API access.
- Rate limits may apply to API calls.
- Effective threat hunting begins with visibility
- Automated reconnaissance, attack path mapping, and risk-based prioritization
- A vulnerability assessment is an ongoing process that must be revisited regularly
  to ensure that the system remains secure.
- Identifying security weaknesses allows you to take preemptive action to fix them
  before they can be used against you.
- Prioritization is crucial in determining how resources should be allocated to address
  vulnerabilities.
- 'Utilize Just-in-Time (JIT) access: Implement JIT access policies to grant users
  temporary permissions only when needed.'
- 'Encrypt data at the application level: Integrate encryption within your applications
  themselves.'
- 'Implement behavior-based threat detection: Employ machine learning and AI-driven
  analytics to monitor and detect anomalies based on user behavior patterns.'
- 'Harden cloud service configurations by default: Start with the most restrictive
  settings when configuring cloud services.'
- 'Conduct regular red team exercises: Regularly perform red team exercises focused
  on cloud environments.'
- CyCognito provides automated active testing, including web application testing/DAST
  at enterprise scale.
- Incorporate DAST early in DevOps pipelines to catch runtime issues earlier.
- DAST can detect runtime issues like session management flaws, insecure direct object
  references (IDOR), and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- DAST actively tests software for exposures, leading to a reduction in false positives.
- DAST is language agnostic and can be used to test any web application.
- DAST tests applications when they are in a running state, which usually means that
  the application has reached the later stages of development.
- DAST does not provide specific information about where issues are located in the
  code.
- DAST tools can be run frequently throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits that require handling in client logic.
- API may have rate limits that could affect data extraction.
- User permissions may restrict access to certain endpoints.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Web application penetration testing is necessary due to the increasing complexity
  and prevalence of web applications in business operations.
- Penetration testing provides insights into security weaknesses and offers actionable
  recommendations for mitigation.
- Integration of the incident response plan with automated incident detection and
  response tools can enhance responsiveness.
- Security testing is critical for organizations handling sensitive data.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- API limits may apply based on usage
- Regularly audit third-party integrations to ensure that all associated APIs are
  documented and conform to your organization’s security policies.
- Employ rate limiting with adaptive algorithms
- Use strong, client-side encryption for sensitive payloads
- Integrate API security into the CI/CD pipeline
- Use HMAC for request validation
- Enable DNS-based security features
