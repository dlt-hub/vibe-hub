notes:
- Excessive usage of the API will be curtailed programmatically.
- CORS is a mechanism that may prevent you from making http request to a domain that
  is different from your website.
- Make sure that the Redirect URI is set up to be used with Postman.
- 'Authorization URL: https://secure.sharefile.com/oauth/index.aspx?redirect_uri=https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback'
- ShareFile uses an exponential back-off strategy when retrying the callback to avoid
  overloading the destination server.
- Currently there is a Time-to-Live of 7 days on the event, and retries may stop after
  that time span.
