notes:
- All edits will be queued until they can be approved by a country editor. If no country
  editors are available, your edit will be approved after 3 days.
- All edits will be queued until they can be approved by a country editor.
- Charging status is not live for the equipment.
- The company last updated these terms on July 12, 2018.
- You must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.
- You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company,
  at info@openchargemap.org.
- API Keys must be real API keys
- Currently have approx 7600 registered apps and services who have an API key to use
  our API, a few thousand of those actively query the data.
- If it’s operated by a business it would be (Business Owner At Location). If it’s
  at your own home it shouldn’t be listed on Open Charge Map.
- Data is either imported or manually contributed, so if nobody has manually contributed
  the information and EV Box have not given us an officially licensed data feed then
  the information won’t be there until you add it or you convince EV Box to provide
  us with a data feed.
- Suggest dropping (aka Carcharger.ie) from the name - no-one refers to it as that,
  & even carcharger.ie itself only displays / directs you to easygo.ie content.
- Approximately half of OCM data is manually entered by users in the community.
- Imported data may come from networks and government open data registrars but currently
  not that many.
- Imports are periodically updated but not automatically (currently) and the import
  process does some basic deduplication checks.
- Manually entered data is submitted for review by country editors and is automatically
  published if nobody reviews it within a few days, or if the user submitting is already
  a country editor.
- We do occasionally refresh the ADFC import and duplicates can happen, but we also
  tend to get thousands of listings we didn’t have before, so there is an upside.
- There is a validation limit of 99 qty of ports.
- Locations added are marked Private instead of public.
- Your network has been added as ChargeBay (US) now, the existing Australian 'Chargebay'
  operator has been renamed Chargebay (AU).
- Regarding maps that use the data, we currently have approx 7600 registered apps
  and services who have an API key to use our API.
- Encourages charging network operators to provide data via OCPI data feed.
- We collect and manage an OCPI data feed of all DC chargers in Costa Rica (21kW and
  above), including real time information of their status (available, charging, inoperative,
  blocked, outoforder, etc).
- Our import will avoid adding locations that are already present, in some cases we
  might arrange for manually added listings to be removed (if they are easily identified)
  to make way for the import if it’s likely to be much more correct.
- Ideally the networks would provide the OCPI feeds to us directly but we are also
  happy take an aggregated feed.
- For the network to provide live data, they need to share a data feed with OCM.
- EasyGo has been renamed to EZO in Ireland.
- Your OCM account has editor permissions for Israel.
- To edit the location of a charging point, sign in, browse to your location and select
  it, select Edit, drag the map and the location of the POI will be moved.
- Requires a working website for operator promotion.
- There is a validation limit for adding quantities over 99.
- Some EV mapping mobile apps have advanced filtering options and can be set to use
  OCM as the database.
- Charges are marked Private instead of public
- They have recently started installing branded EV chargers, but they also have Tesla
  chargers on some sites (v2 and v3), and other network operators at other sites.
- Some of these sites are already in the database via Tesla, chargepoint, and others.
- API doesn’t have filtering on postal code or province.
- Encourages charging network operators to provide OCPI data feed directly.
- The OCPI URL provided does not connect, most likely due to geographic filtering
  at the firewall level.
- The project is not a map, it is an open data set of EV charging locations.
- Historical occupancy data is typically only known to the charging networks themselves.
- Many charging networks may not have the data.
- Occupancy data can be commercially sensitive.
- Our import will avoid adding locations that are already present.
- We don’t currently have an OCPP import as that tends to be used for communication
  between the chargepoint and the network operator.
- Even OCPI is limited because some forms of it require is to conduct a two way back
  and forth conversation to negotiate our final credentials, which we don’t currently
  do.
- For data import, the network needs to provide a data feed we are allowed to use.
- Your instagram links `temcarregadores.com.br` but that website doesn’t work.
- We don’t really have a pricing/tariffs except for Usage Cost which is free text,
  so you can supply any information you see as relevant.
- In the future we may support additional tariff information but that would only be
  from automated network data feeds.
- Get an API key by signing into openchargemap.org, then use my profile > my apps,
  register an application.
- API returns no data when specifying start and end points of a route.
- They have recently started installing branded EV chargers.
- Some sites have Tesla chargers (v2 and v3) and other network operators.
- Our API doesn’t have filtering on postal code or province.
- Occupancy is commercially sensitive from a corporate investment point of view.
- Open Charge Map has a strict requirement that data entered is not copied without
  permission from other sources.
- There is no bulk import other than providing an OCPI data feed, this is because
  data in different formats required their own code to be built for each import.
- They cover the UK (Scotland) and have one site in Sweden too.
- Their website is down which isn’t really a good indicator!
- Generally our data starts in 2011.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- When specifying start and end points, the API returns no data.
- The API key can be accepted as an HTTP header.
- Pagination is not currently supported, but adjustments are being made to handle
  it.
- Limit 50 Locations for single GET Locations request.
- Full list of Locations can be received on several requests.
- The API already has a bounding box parameter.
- No data returned for specified start & end points
- Including boundingbox in URL may be necessary
- In general if you have a comment or photo you wish to remote you can sign into https://openchargemap.org
  and use the my profile > my comments option or my profile > my uploads option to
  remove things you no longer want to share.
- Locations of EV charging stations awarded through Round 1 of California's NEVI funding
  program that are planned for deployment.
- There is no bulk import other than providing an OCPI data feed.
- Website for Green Charge Georgia is down.
- The biggest issue is network fragmentation, there are simply too many charging networks
  globally.
- When a location is no longer active it will either become Not Operational or Decommissioned.
- Periodically clean up decommissioned items to avoid mapping confusion.
- A network operator can publish an OCPI data feed and license it so we can redistribute
  the information.
- We’d need to filter on country (`WHERE CountryID=2`) but we also would only be able
  to update items that have been manually entered, anything that comes from an imported
  source (approx 1000 of those items) pretty much has to stay as it was as subsequent
  imports will clobber any changes.
- Long term though, we would like pretty much all of our data to come via OCPI data
  feeds directly from the networks themselves, at that point we could have automated
  cleanup (for all US OCPI imports).
- Providing data feed is simple if you have an OCPI based system.
- A data sharing agreement must be completed.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- CSV isn’t a great format because it lacks detail compared to the default JSON output.
- Country code examples are 2 character ISO.
- You need Bounding Box to specify area for charging points.
- Uses token C for connecting to OCPI system
- Supports a limit of 50 Locations for single GET Locations request
- X-Total-Count header in response shows the total number of Locations.
- OCPI expects non-null entries for connector format, max_amperage and tarrif_ids
  and tarrif_ids should be an array.
- The API is currently free for everyone, but some users abuse it.
- User contributions are essential for refining data.
- I do force myself to work on it sometimes but I rarely use it myself and any fixes/support
  I do for it are just to try to keep it going.
- The actual data is refined by the community of users themselves, I don’t do any
  of that (or try not to).
- Current active construction sites include Williams, CA; Chula Vista, CA; Hazard,
  KY; Harrington, DE; Camden, DE; Arlington, WA.
- Ford has its 'Ford Charge' network up and running at many Ford/Lincoln dealerships,
  but they are using existing network providers.
- Ford appears to have a uniform requirement for 240W stations, but I can't confirm
  that.
- Ford Charge locations are not listed as part of the Shell Recharge network.
- Network fragmentation is a key issue in charging infrastructure.
- API is currently free for everyone, but some users abuse it.
- Currently, I’m the only person running this.
- The API has supported comments/checking for a long time.
- We’d need to filter on country (`WHERE CountryID=2`)
- We would only be able to update items that have been manually entered, anything
  that comes from an imported source (approx 1000 of those items) pretty much has
  to stay as it was as subsequent imports will clobber any changes.
- Long term though, we would like pretty much all of our data to come via OCPI data
  feeds directly from the networks themselves.
- Providing a data feed is relatively simple if you already have an OCPI based system.
- There is no complex legal agreement, just a data sharing agreement form is needed.
- You need Bounding Box.
- They have started to open stations in the home state of WI and have plans to open
  many sites at their gas stations Kwik Trip.

  daily depending on what other priorities I have.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Open Charge
  Map
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Discontinuing most data imports in favor of user edits.
- Data is refined by the community of users themselves
- If something is hopelessly wrong you can set it to Removed (decommissioned) and
  it will disappear from the result set.
