auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/authentication:
  - Access tokens are obtained via OAuth 2.0 and used as HTTP Bearer tokens. Include
    the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>". When
    an access token expires, use the /oauth/token endpoint with grant_type set to
    "refresh_token" and the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
  - OAuth 2.0 web server flow using client_id and client_secret. Redirect user to
    /oauth2/authorise with client_id, scopes, and redirect_uri. Exchange authorization
    code at /oauth/token endpoint via POST with code, client_id, client_secret, and
    grant_type set to authorization_code to obtain access_token and refresh_token.
    Use access_token in subsequent API requests. Verify tokens at /oauth/verify endpoint.
    Refresh expired access tokens by posting refresh_token to /oauth/token endpoint.
  - The Companies House API supports two authentication methods. First, HTTP basic
    authentication using an API or stream key as the username (password left blank)
    sent via the Authorization header in the format "Basic base64(key:)". Second,
    OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication for certain endpoints, requiring developer
    registration to obtain client_id and client_secret, with end-user involvement
    to acquire an access token sent via the Authorization header as "Bearer access_token".

  - 'Access to the Companies House API requires authentication via one of three methods:
    API key, stream key, or OAuth access token. These credentials must be sent with
    each request. Details on creating applications and obtaining these credentials
    are available in the authentication documentation.'
