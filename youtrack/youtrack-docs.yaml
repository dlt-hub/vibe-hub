      as "Bearer perm:reporter-token" when making API requests to create drafts on

    - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, here is the authentication information:


      Bearer token authentication is used with the Authorization header. The token
      is passed as ''Authorization: Bearer perm:reporter-token''. Different user roles
      (Standard user vs Reporter) have different permission levels for API operations,
      with Reporter role having restricted access to certain operations like creating
      comments or issues via the REST API.'
    - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Send the token in the Authorization
      header as ''Authorization: Bearer perm:token1'' (or your actual token value).
      The token format appears to be ''perm:'' prefixed for permanent tokens.'
