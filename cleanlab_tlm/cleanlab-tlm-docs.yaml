notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Cleanlab offers Enterprise API connectors that allow your SMEs to work in any major
  platform rather than the Cleanlab Web Interface.
- Cleanlab can be privately deployed in your company’s Virtual Private Cloud, such
  that no data leaves your firewall.
- TLM significantly improves the quality of LLM responses by reducing mistakes and
  outperforming other evaluation methods.
- Can be deployed in your company’s own cloud such that all data remains within your
  private infrastructure.
- Requires setup of connected app in Cleanlab Studio
- Cleanlab Studio works for both structured (tabular) and unstructured (image, text)
  datasets.
- You can just try both approaches and see which works better for your data.
- Uses API key for authentication — requires setup of an account in Cleanlab Studio
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'ValueError: CLI is out of date and must be updated.'
