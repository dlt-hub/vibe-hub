auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.mouseflow.com:
  - 'API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are the user''s email and API
    token, formatted as "email:token" and base64-encoded in the Authorization header
    as "Basic {base64_credentials}". For example, the header would be Authorization:
    Basic followed by the base64 encoding of "my@email.com:token1234".'
  - Authentication to the API uses HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your email address as
    the username and your API key as the password. All requests must be made over
    HTTPS to the appropriate datacenter endpoint (https://api-us.mouseflow.com or
    https://api-eu.mouseflow.com). API keys have the same privileges as your user
    level and can be managed from your Mouseflow account.
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as a base64-encoded pair
    in the Authorization header using the format "Basic base64(email:token)", or use
    HTTPBasicAuth with email as username and API token as password. Example: basic_auth(''my@email.com'',
    ''token1234'').'
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as username (email) and
    password (API token) in the Authorization header using the format `Authorization:
    Basic base64(email:token)`. Example: `curl -u my@email.com:token1234` or set basic
    auth with email as username and API token as password.'
  - Basic authentication is required using email and token credentials. Send requests
    with HTTP Basic Auth using the email address as username and API token as password
    (e.g., `curl -u my@email.com:token1234`). In Python, use `requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth('my@email.com',
    'token1234')` or pass the auth tuple directly to requests methods.
