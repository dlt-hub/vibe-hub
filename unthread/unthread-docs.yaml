  of the organization, so no internal channels will be tracked.
- Only messages from 'Customers' are tracked.
- The channel must be connected to Unthread.
- Projects are a way to separate different teams using Unthread who have a different
  group of admins and agents.
- Welcome to the Unthread Helpdesk! Search or browse below for common questions.
