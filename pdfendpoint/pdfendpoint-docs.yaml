auth_info:
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/:
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY" (replace SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY with your actual API
    key obtained by signing up). Send this header with every POST request to the API
    endpoint.
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/playground:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Send requests
    with the header "Authorization: Bearer SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY" where SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY
    is replaced with your actual API key obtained by signing up.'
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/docs:
  - API requests require Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY", where SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY is replaced with your
    actual API key obtained by signing up. The header name is Authorization and the
    scheme is Bearer.
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/docs/authentication:
  - Authentication to the API uses HTTP Bearer Token. Include an Authorization header
    with the value Bearer <token>, where <token> is your secret API key obtained from
    the Dashboard after signing up. The header key must be exactly "Authorization"
    and the value format is "Bearer " followed by your token.
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/docs/endpoints:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY" (replace SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY with your actual API key
    obtained by signing up). The header name is "Authorization" and the format is
    "Bearer" followed by your key.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/docs/endpoints:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (max 100 PDFs per request) and
    page (page number to return). The documentation does not specify response fields
    indicating total pages, whether to stop paginating, or how to construct subsequent
    requests beyond incrementing the page parameter.
  - The list endpoint uses query parameters page (page number) and limit (number of
    PDFs to return, max 100) for pagination. The endpoint returns PDFs from latest
    to oldest, with from and to date filters also available as query parameters.
- information_source; https://pdfendpoint.com/llms.txt:
  - The List PDFs endpoint supports pagination with `limit` (number of PDFs to return,
    max 100) and `page` (page number) as query parameters. The response structure
    for indicating pagination state is not documented.
