notes:
- Keep your API keys safe and do not post them publicly.
- Tracking numbers are not unique, provide additional information for unique identification.
- Your endpoint needs to return a 200 OK to HEAD requests.
- Recommended to return useful information in POST response body.
- Webhook messages are not guaranteed to arrive and be processed in order.
- If Ship24 doesn't receive an HTTP status code in the 2xx range to a webhook request,
  the request will be retried up to 20 times with an exponential backoff.
- If your infrastructure or system restricts the reception of requests from public
  IPs, please allow all the specified IPs.
- Providing courierCode improves tracking accuracy.
- Up to 3 couriers can be provided per shipment, totaling a maximum of 9 couriers.
- Up to 3 couriers can be provided at a time, for a total of 9 couriers maximum per
  shipment.
- statusCode and statusCategory may be empty on non-significant events, but statusMilestone
  will always be provided.
- Our API has a fixed rate limiter on all endpoints that allows a maximum of 10 requests
  per second per endpoint.
- Our server will answer `429 Too Many Requests` after that.
