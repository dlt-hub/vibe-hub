  - 'Sprinklr APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, supporting three grant types:
    Code Grant, Client Credentials Grant Type, and JWT Certificate Based Token Generation
    Process. All OAuth flows operate over HTTPS and use one-time tokens to provide
    limited access to HTTP services while invoking user-level governance and security
    models.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header, along with
    an API key passed in the Key header. The Authorization header should contain the
    value "Bearer" followed by credentials, and the api-key header must include your
    API key for authentication to access the Custom Field endpoints.
