notes:
- The specified DDL must be written in the native SQL dialect of the target database,
  and is not portable across databases.
- No proprietary API - managed only by standard Java APIs (JPA 2 / JDO 2).
- Database is stored as a single file.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- ObjectDB is the only Object-Oriented Database with built in support for JPA 2.
- ObjectDB is the only database management system with built in support of the Java
  Persistence API (JPA).
- ObjectDB is a full featured standalone Object Database Management System (ODBMS)
  and not an ORM tool.
- ObjectDB can be downloaded and used at no cost (including commercially) with the
  restriction of a maximum of 10 entity classes and one million entity objects per
  database file.
- ObjectDB is a commercial software and using it without these restrictions requires
  purchasing a license.
- Documentation on this website explains how to use JPA in the context of the ObjectDB
  Object Database but mostly relevant also for ORM JPA implementations, such as Hibernate
  (and HQL), EclipseLink, TopLink, OpenJPA and DataNucleus.
- We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
  the age of 13.
- This tutorial demonstrates how to create and run a simple JPA application in Eclipse.
- The Point class represents Point objects in the database.
- The tutorial was written for NetBeans 6.9.1 but it should work with other NetBeans
  versions as well.
- JPA 2.0
- JPA 3.2
- Portable applications should not rely on the standard timeout hint. Depending on
  the database in use and the locking mechanisms used by the provider, the hint may
  or may not be observed.
- Interface used to control transactions on resource-local entity managers.
- Dynamic queries can be built using the Criteria Query API.
- This annotation is a marker annotation (with no attributes).
- 'Since: JPA 1.0'
- An entity class holds state, represented as persistent fields and properties.
- Every entity class must have at least one field or property annotated Id or EmbeddedId
  holding the primary key of the entity.
- Specifies the callback listener classes to be used for an entity or mapped superclass.
- Specifies that the invocation of default listeners is to be excluded for the entity
  class (or mapped superclass) and its subclasses.
- A mapped superclass is not a persistent type, and is not mapped to a database table.
- Mapping information may be overridden in each such subclass using the AttributeOverride
  and AssociationOverride annotations or corresponding XML elements.
- ObjectDB silently ignores all the above annotations.
- ObjectDB supports only the preferred JPA query language, JPQL, and silently ignores
  all the above annotations.
- Specifies the column mapped by the annotated persistent property or field.
- If no Column annotation is explicitly specified, the default values apply.
- If the DiscriminatorColumn annotation is missing, and a discriminator column is
  required, the name of the discriminator column defaults to 'DTYPE' and the discriminator
  type to DiscriminatorType.STRING.
- Defines supported types of the discriminator column.
- The DiscriminatorValue annotation can only be specified on a concrete entity class.
- If the DiscriminatorValue annotation is not specified, and a discriminator column
  is used, a provider-specific function is used to generate a value representing the
  entity type.
- Enumerated the options for mapping entity inheritance.
- Specifies a column for joining an entity association or element collection.
- If the JoinColumn annotation itself is defaulted, a single join column is assumed
  and the default values apply.
- Specifies the mapping for composite foreign keys.
- This annotation may not be applied to a persistent field or property not annotated
  ManyToOne, OneToOne, ManyToMany, or OneToMany.
- The LOB type (BLOB or CLOB) is inferred from the type of the persistent field or
  property.
- The map key can be a basic type, an embeddable class, or an entity.
- If the map is specified using Java generics, the MapKeyClass annotation and associated
  type need not be specified.
- Default values apply if no MapKeyJoinColumn annotation is specified.
- Supports composite map keys that reference entities.
- When the MapKeyJoinColumns annotation is used, both the name and the referencedColumnName
  elements must be specified in each of the grouped MapKeyJoinColumn annotations.
- The order column must be of integral type.
- The order column value for the first element is 0.
- Defaults to the generated SQL to create a column of the inferred type.
- If no PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation is specified for a subclass in the JOINED
  mapping strategy, the foreign key columns are assumed to have the same names as
  the primary key columns of the primary table of the superclass.
- Used to map composite foreign keys
- The join table that maps the relationship. The joinTable element must be specified
  if a join table is used in the overriding of the mapping of the relationship.
- The joinTable element must not be specified if a foreign key mapping is used in
  the overriding of the relationship.
- If this annotation is not specified, a default foreign key strategy is selected
  by the persistence provider.
- The provider will generate foreign key constraints whose update and delete actions
  it determines most appropriate for the join column(s) to which the foreign key annotation
  is applied.
- If both this element and the foreignKey element of any of the joinColumns elements
  are specified, the behavior is undefined.
- If no foreign key annotation element is specified in either location, the persistence
  provider's default foreign key strategy will apply.
- Optional comment to be applied to the column. This is only used if table generation
  is in effect.
- 'Optional: Whether the column is included in SQL INSERT statements generated by
  the persistence provider.'
- The column length applies only to columns whose type is parameterized by length,
  for example, varchar or varbinary types.
- The name of the column. Defaults to the property or field name.
- Whether the database column is nullable.
- 'Optional: A SQL fragment appended to the generated DDL which declares this column.
  May not be used in conjunction with Column.columnDefinition.'
- The precision for a column of SQL type decimal or numeric, or of similar database-native
  type.
- Applies only to columns of exact numeric type.
- The default value 0 indicates that a provider-determined precision should be inferred.
- The default value 0 indicates that a provider-determined scale should be inferred.
- The default value -1 indicates that fractional seconds should not be stored in a
  time column, or that the maximum number of digits supported by the database and
  JDBC driver should be stored in a timestamp column.
- 'Optional: The name of the table that contains the column. If absent the column
  is assumed to be in the primary table.'
- Optional whether the column is a unique key.
- This is a shortcut for the UniqueConstraint annotation at the table level.
- 'Optional: Whether the column is included in SQL UPDATE statements generated by
  the persistence provider.'
