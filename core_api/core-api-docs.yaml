notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- CORE APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
- CORE APIs support refresh tokens.
- CORE APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to securely authenticate and authorize your
  apps.
- Redirect URIs must match those defined in the developer portal.
- Ensure the redirect URI matches the one set in the Developer Portal
- Use the provided callback URLs for quick setup
- Webhook events are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON body.
- A total of 5 attempts are made with an interval of 30 seconds between each retry.
- Listen for limited event types to avoid strain on the server.
- Delivery attempts and retry logic should be handled by the endpoint.
- Webhook endpoints can receive duplicate events; process them idempotently.
- Order of events is not guaranteed.
- Validate events using the X-BQECore-Signature header.
- Use an HTTPS server for secure event receipt.
- Refresh Tokens must be stored securely by an application.
- Access to the CORE company terminates when the current refresh_token expires.
- The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a
  user agent with a server. This header is required for all the requests
- Custom fields can be assigned to modules.
- Uses OAuth2 with access token
- Use HTTP GET method to retrieve existing record or records
- Use HTTP POST method to add a new record
- Use the HTTP POST BATCH method to save multiple resources in the database
- Use HTTP PUT method to edit an existing record by sending a complete object
- Use HTTP PATCH method to edit an existing record by sending a partial object
- Use HTTP DELETE method to remove an existing record
- Parameters allow you to specify further action on the resources.
- By default, the list endpoints only return flat models in the response body and
  any nested resources are not retrieved. You can use the expand parameter to retrieve
  the nested resources.
