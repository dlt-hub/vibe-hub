  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the "api-key" header and
    an API signature in the "api-signature" header with each request to authenticate.
  - 'HollaEx uses API key authentication for private endpoints. Three headers are
    required in all private API requests: api-key (your API key), api-signature (HMAC
    signature), and api-expires (Unix timestamp). Register for credentials in the
    security section of hollaex.com.'
  - 'HollaEx uses HMAC-SHA256 authentication for private API access. Requests require
    three headers: api-key (your API key), api-signature (HMAC-SHA256 hash of a formatted
    string), and api-expires (unix timestamp). The signature string format is ${METHOD}${PATH}${api-expires}
    for requests without a body, or ${METHOD}${PATH}${api-expires}${JSON_BODY} for
    requests with a body. The HMAC is computed using your api-secret as the key. All
    three values must be included in request headers.'
  - 'The API uses HMAC-based request signing for authentication. Include three required
    headers in every request: api-key (your API key), api-signature (HMAC signature
    of the request), and api-expires (request expiration timestamp). The signature
    must be computed using your API secret and included as the api-signature header
    value.'
  - 'The API uses three custom headers for authentication: api-key (your API key),
    api-signature (HMAC signature of the request), and api-expires (request expiration
    timestamp). These headers must be included in all requests to authenticate and
    authorize access.'
