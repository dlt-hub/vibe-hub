pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.modash.io/products/discovery_api/openapi_doc/discovery/collaborations:
  - Use cursor-based pagination with optional limit parameter (1-30, default 30).
    Pass cursor string from previous response to get next page; cursor is valid for
    2 days. Stop when no cursor is returned in response.
  - When using the Search API, each response returns 15 influencers total. To retrieve
    more results for the same query, increment the `page` parameter in the request
    body, which defaults to `0`.
