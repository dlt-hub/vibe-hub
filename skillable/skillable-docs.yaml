notes:
- API Key must be obtained from a Skillable team member.
- API key should never be exposed to client-side code.
- Self-Paced or On-demand training is associated with course assignments or subscriptions.
- A student or learner is an end user assigned lab content for training, upskilling,
  or assessment purposes within the Skillable TMS platform.
- Hardwired connections are preferred over using a WiFi connection.
- WiFi connections are not recommended and could impact lab user experience if any
  network issues arise.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires setup of connected app in Skillable
- May have specific data formats for handling LTI payloads
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Skillable
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This only applies to labs running on the Hyper-V platform only.
- 'Certain lab environments utilize GitHub; therefore, the following URL should be
  added as a firewall exception: https://githubusercontent.com'
- Skillable Insights provides dashboards and reports for data analytics.
- Moving to a new product comes with a number of Challenges.
- Understanding this, we have strived to make the flow of documentation you may need
  to follow as close to the original Azure Lab Services documentation as possible.
- A Lab Series is a container that holds one or more Lab Profiles.
- Ensure correct user account is used to access training.
- Skillable Studio is meant for lab developers to create and manage labs.
- Use various Skillable Studio components to build and configure labs.

  LMS, CRM, BI and/or learning system.
- Skillable Studio supports containers via Docker.
- Use Skillable Connect to integrate into your existing LMS, CRM, BI and/or learning
  system.
- Skillable Connect provides OpenAPI compliance, with clear, searchable documentation
  on how to consume APIs.

  Studio without being associated to a Lab Series.
- Skillable's lab building & authoring platform.
- Integration scenarios are not covered in this document.
- Contact your CSM or Account executive to gain Skillable Insights access.
- Some replacement tokens may not be available in your lab, depending on the lab's
  configuration.
- Skillable's lab launching capabilities support a variety of integration methods.
- Automated Activities are configured in the Lab Instructions, using the lab instruction
  editor.
- Activities can be modified anytime, by anyone that has access to edit the lab instructions.
- The Instructions File Import feature allows users to import content from Word, RTF,
  and Markdown files directly into the Instructions Editor.
- User-friendly error messages are displayed, and errors are logged for further analysis.
- Use Automated Activities in areas of your lab when students are prone to making
  mistakes.
- Provide the student feedback with your scripts where possible, to help them complete
  the lab instructions correctly.
- Some replacement tokens may not be available in your lab, depending on the lab's
  configuration. I.E. Cloud related tokens are not available in labs that do not use
  cloud orchestration, and virtualization related tokens are not available in labs
  that only use a cloud-based configuration.
- Activities are configurable in the instructions editor.
- API allows setting and using variables in lab instructions
- Automated Activities can use scripts for various tasks.
- Scoring must be enabled in your lab for scoring-related options.
- API lab launches are not affected by the Override theme during lab launch.
- Activities are configured in the instructions editor and represented in the lab
  instructions by a replacement token.
- Themes allow styling to be configured for a lab profile, to provide a custom look
  and feel.
- Skillable places a strong emphasis on data protection, and your integration should
  align with these principles.

- LTI 1.3 provides a secure and effective way for LMS systems to integrate with tool
  providers like Skillable, enhancing the learning experience by providing access
  to a wide range of educational resources, including labs.
- Skillable emphasizes data security and compliance with regulations.
- API integration offers flexibility and adaptability for various training programs.
- Requests are not case sensitive.
- Lab Profiles with a development status of Complete are consumable via API.
- SCORM promotes content reusability, reducing development time and costs.
- SCORM Lab Launcher provides basic security and simple results reporting.
- LTI 1.3 provides a secure and effective way for LMS systems to integrate with tool
  providers like Skillable.
- Webhooks do not require a request.
