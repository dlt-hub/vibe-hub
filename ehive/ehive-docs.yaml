auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.ehive.com/authentication/:
  - OAuth2 authorization using client credentials flow. Send a POST request to https://ehive.com/api/oauth2/v2/authorize
    with headers Client-Id, Client-Secret, Authorization set to "OAuth", and Grant-Type
    set to "client_credentials". The obtained access token is then sent with clientId
    for subsequent API requests. Expired tokens return HTTP 401 and require re-authentication
    at the token endpoint https://ehive.com/api/oauth2/v2/token.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization_code grant flow. Obtain an access token via POST to /api/oauth2/v2/token
    with Authorization: OAuth and Grant-Type: authorization_code headers, receiving
    oauthToken in JSON response. Include Client-Id header with clientId value, Authorization:
    Basic header with the OAuth access token, and trackingId query parameter in all
    subsequent API requests.'
  - 'OAuth2 client credentials flow requiring Client-Id and Client-Secret headers
    sent to the authorize endpoint, followed by a token exchange using the returned
    Access-Grant header. All requests require Authorization: OAuth header, with Grant-Type
    header specifying the flow type (client_credentials for initial authorization,
    authorization_code for token exchange).'
  - eHive API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization and authentication. During authorization,
    send clientId and clientSecret to https://ehive.com/api/oauth2/v2/authorize to
    obtain an access grant, then exchange it at the token endpoint for an OAuth access
    token. For API requests, include clientId and the OAuth access token in request
    headers. Additionally, include a trackingId header to track user access and prevent
    abuse.

  - The eHive API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. Refer to the Authentication section
    at https://developers.ehive.com/authentication for specific details on token acquisition,
    required headers, scopes, and credential submission methods.
