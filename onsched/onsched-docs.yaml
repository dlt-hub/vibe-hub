  a new token with each mount.
- Elements can be chained together using the Event Listeners to create more complex
  booking flows.
- Setup Elements should always be protected behind an authenticated area of your application.
- Consumer Elements are public facing, and therefore are accessible without generating
  an API token via the API.
