notes:
- D-Bus allows sending file descriptors - references to open files, sockets, etc.
- D-Bus includes a mechanism to introspect remote objects.
- D-Bus is designed to be used between programs on the same computer.
- D-Bus is primarily used on Linux to interact with various parts of the operating
  system.
- Authentication failures now raise a new AuthenticationError subclass of ValueError,
  so that they can be caught specifically.
- Fixed logic error when authentication is rejected.
- If you are setting up a socket for D-Bus, you will need to do SASL authentication
  before starting to send and receive D-Bus messages.
- Raised in tasks waiting for a reply when the router is closed
- This will also be raised if the receiver task crashes, so tasks are not stuck waiting
  for a reply that can never come
errors:
- 'FDNegotiationError: raised if the message bus can’t or won’t support file descriptor
  support'
- 'AuthenticationError: Raised when authentication fails'
- 'RouterClosed: Raised in tasks waiting for a reply when the router is closed'
