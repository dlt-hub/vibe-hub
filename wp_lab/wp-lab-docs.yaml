notes:
- 'Updating an existing product from a CSV file will be very much like updating the
  product manually in WooCommerce: Unlocked listings will be marked as changed while
  locked listings will have their price and inventory updated instantly, resulting
  a slower import process.'
- Please keep in mind that your products should have unique SKUs â€“ for variable products,
  each variation needs to have a SKU as well.
- Unfortunately not. Item specifics and shipping options are not simple meta field
  containing only a single value. Instead, they are both tabular data with an unknown
  number of rows, which is why they are stored as serialized arrays in a single meta
  field. This data looks rather cryptic, like 'a:2{i:0;a:3:{s:4...', which is not
  suitable for being imported from a CSV file (or edited in a spreadsheet app).
- Instead of importing item specifics, we recommend importing normal WooCommerce product
  attributes, which are sent to eBay as item specifics automatically. Shipping options
  should rather be define in the listing profile, not on the product level.
- Use external cron job to ensure tasks are executed without site traffic.
- No columns for sale prices and dates in an inventory report.
