auth_info:
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log:
  - Bearer tokens are required to edit command permissions. The bearer token must
    be retrieved via OAuth2 and the authenticating user must have permission to manage
    the guild and roles. The applications.commands.permissions.update OAuth2 scope
    is required for this operation.
  - The `role_connections.write` OAuth2 scope is required to authenticate requests
    for retrieving and updating a user's role connections via the GET and PUT endpoints
    at `/users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection`.
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/overview:
  - Request signature validation using Ed25519. The public key (APPLICATION_PUBLIC_KEY)
    is obtained from the Developer Portal. Validate incoming requests by verifying
    the X-Signature-Ed25519 header against the concatenated X-Signature-Timestamp
    header and request body using NaCl's VerifyKey.
  - 'Validate security-related request headers sent by Discord: the `X-Signature-Ed25519`
    header contains an Ed25519 signature and the `X-Signature-Timestamp` header contains
    a timestamp. Your app must verify that the signature matches the request body
    using the public key associated with your app. This is a required security measure
    before processing any interactions.'
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands:
  - Command permissions require a Bearer token (OAuth2) for updates, not a bot token.
    The Bearer token must be authorized with the `applications.commands.permissions.update`
    scope. The authenticating user must have Manage Guild, Manage Roles permissions
    in the guild, ability to run the command being edited, and permission to manage
    affected resources (roles, users, channels).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log:
  - Setting `with_member` to `true` enables pagination for List Thread Members endpoint
    using `after` (cursor) and `limit` (default 100) query parameters to fetch additional
    thread members. In API v11, pagination will always be enabled regardless of the
    `with_member` parameter.
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message:
  - The Get Channel Pins endpoint uses limit-offset pagination. The limit query parameter
    (optional, default 50, range 1-50) controls the number of pins returned. The response
    includes a has_more boolean field. To get additional pins, use the before query
    parameter set to the pinned_at timestamp of the last pin from the previous response,
    then repeat with limit=50.
- information_source; https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user:
  - The endpoint uses query string parameters before (snowflake, optional) and after
    (snowflake, optional) for cursor-based pagination, along with limit (integer,
    1-200, default 200) to control page size. However, pagination is not needed since
    the endpoint returns a maximum of 200 guilds by default, which is the maximum
    non-bot users can join.
