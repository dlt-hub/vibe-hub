auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.vatusa.net/:
  - 'The VATUSA API supports two authentication methods: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs, translated
    from Laravel sessions) and API Keys issued to facilities. Endpoints accept JWT
    in the Authorization header, API Keys as query parameters or headers, or session
    cookies. Some endpoints also accept a ?test query parameter for sandbox testing.
    Facilities with a configured APIv2 JWK will receive responses encapsulated in
    a signed JSON Web Signature package per RFC 7515.'
- information_source; https://api.vatusa.net/docs/api-docs.json:
  - API Key, JWT, or Session Cookie authentication is supported. API Key requires
    no special roles. JWT and Session Cookie require Senior Staff or Training Staff
    roles. Send API Key in the appropriate header (exact header name not specified
    in this excerpt), JWT as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, or Session
    Cookie in request cookies.
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) translated from Laravel sessions or API Keys issued to facilities.
    JWT is sent in the Authorization header. API Keys can be sent via header, query
    parameter, or session cookie. Facilities with APIv2 JWK configured in settings
    receive signed response packages. Use ?test query parameter to prevent database
    changes in development environments.
  - 'The API supports three authentication methods: API Key, JWT (JSON Web Token),
    or Session Cookie. For JWT and Session Cookie authentication, certain endpoints
    require specific roles such as Senior Staff or Training Staff. API Key authentication
    does not have role restrictions. Credentials should be sent as an API Key header,
    JWT bearer token in the Authorization header, or as a session cookie in the request.'
  - 'This endpoint requires authentication via a Key and role-based authorization.
    The user must have one of the following roles: Key, Mentor (at or above the requested
    rating), Instructor, or Senior Staff. The exact mechanism for sending the Key
    (header name, parameter name, or body field) is not specified in this excerpt.'
