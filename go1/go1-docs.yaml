  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" with each request to the /files/upload-url
    endpoint.'
- information_source; https://developers.go1.com/api/rest/2025-01-01/overview:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication using client_id and client_secret to obtain an access
    token. Include the access token in the Authorization header of requests. Apps
    must also request specific access scopes during the authentication process as
    defined in the Scopes documentation.
  - Requests to the Go1 API require OAuth 2.0 authentication. You must obtain an access
    token using your client_id and client_secret credentials, then include the token
    in an Authorization header with each request.
  - 'The API requires an access token passed in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    {access_token}". Additionally, requests should include an Api-Version header (e.g.,
    "Api-Version: 2025-01-01") to specify the API version being used.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.go1.com/api/rest/2025-01-01/overview:
  - Pagination information is available but not shown in the provided documentation
    excerpt. The overview page lists "Pagination" as a section in the table of contents
    at `/api/rest/2025-01-01/overview/#pagination`, but the actual pagination details
    are not included in the text provided. To extract pagination parameters and behaviors,
    the full pagination section content would need to be provided.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit (integer, default 20,
    range 1-50) specifies results per page; offset (integer, optional) specifies where
    to start. Response includes total (total result count) and hit array (page results).
    Offset-based pagination is capped at 10,000 results; some endpoints support a
    scroll parameter for larger datasets.
- information_source; https://developers.go1.com/api/rest/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit (default 20, range 1-50)
    specifies results per page; offset specifies the starting item position. Response
    includes total field for total count. Offset-based pagination cannot exceed 10,000
    results; some endpoints support a scroll parameter for larger datasets.
  - Use offset-limit pagination with query parameters offset (optional, default 0)
    and limit (optional, default varies by endpoint). Response includes total field
    indicating total number of results; continue paginating by incrementing offset
    until offset plus returned results count equals or exceeds total.
- information_source; https://developers.go1.com/api/rest/v2/overview:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit (default 20, range 1-50)
    specifies results per page; offset specifies the starting item position. The response
    includes a total field indicating total results. Offset-based pagination cannot
    exceed 10,000 results; some endpoints support a scroll parameter for larger datasets.
