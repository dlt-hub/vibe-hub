notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in Sezzle
- Sandbox API keys cannot be used in the production dashboard.
- Production API keys cannot be used in the sandbox.
- API Keys do not translate across environments.
- Only one environment’s dashboard session can be active in the browser at a time.
- Tokenization is optional, recommended only for charging via Sezzle outside standard
  checkouts.
- Orders created via customer UUID are treated the same as those from a standard Sezzle
  checkout.
- Token must be replaced every 120 minutes.
- Use API keys to obtain an authentication token
- Update the wrapper element’s class name to the theme color you desire (indigo or
  black)
- Update the Learn More href URL to point to your own How Sezzle Works page, if applicable
- Express Checkout is available to all Sezzle partners at no extra cost. You’ll just
  need a Merchant ID (MID) to activate it.
- Your website or app must already be set up to accept Sezzle payments before enabling
  Express Checkout.
- Express Checkout option is only available for direct integration and WooCommerce
  merchants.
- For security purposes, authentication and checkout update must originate from merchant’s
  back-end code.
- The default authorization expiration is 30 minutes for all merchants except Shopify,
  whose default is 7 days
- You can extend this up to a maximum of 7 days
- Once the authorization expires, capturing is denied, and any uncaptured amount is
  released
- If the order total is not captured before expiration, the order is deleted
- Payment is considered paid only when the amount is captured
- If the order amount shows Not Captured and the Captured value in the History section
  of the Merchant Dashboard is 0, the order amount has not been captured
- If the amount remains uncaptured before the authorization expires, the order will
  be deleted
- Sezzle lacks permissions to view or modify Shopify inventory, so this feature is
  not supported with the new payment app.
- Widgets will only show for IP addresses in US and CA.
- By default, widgets only show on products up to $2500.
- Sezzle operates only in US and Canada
- Express Checkout is temporarily enabled for limited merchant IDs.
- This integration is only available with BigCommerce’s Optimized One Page Checkout.

- Sezzle is currently available for customers from The United States and Canada.
- Payment Action set as Authorize and Capture — Payment will automatically be captured
  during the checkout process.
- Payment Action set as Authorize Only — needs to be captured manually from backoffice.
- Only 3D Cart legacy merchants can use Sezzle at the moment.
- Copy your Private Key and Public Key from your Sezzle Merchant Dashboard
- Ensure you have the Merchant UUID and the API Keys from the Sezzle Merchant Dashboard.
- Set `Payment from Applicable Countries` to `Specific Countries`
- Set `Payment from Specific Countries` to `United States` or `Canada` as applicable
