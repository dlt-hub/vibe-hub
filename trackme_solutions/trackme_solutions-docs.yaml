  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Tokens are obtained from a session
    endpoint and remain valid for 1 hour by default. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Splunk $token" where $token is the session token value.'
  - 'The Splunk REST API supports three authentication methods. The recommended approach
    is bearer token authentication, where you pass the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>". Alternatively, you can use basic authentication
    with username and password via the curl -u flag, or generate an API token by authenticating
    to the /services/auth/login endpoint with username and password form data, which
    returns a sessionKey that can be used for subsequent REST calls.'
- information_source; https://docs.trackme-solutions.com/admin_guide_rest.html:
  - 'Splunk REST API authentication can be done via bearer token or basic authentication.
    For bearer tokens, pass the token in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>". For basic authentication, use standard HTTP basic auth credentials.
    The documentation references Splunk''s authentication token documentation for
    token creation details.'
  - 'Token-based authentication using the Authorization header with the scheme "Splunk".
    The token is obtained from a session and remains valid for 1 hour by default.
    Send the token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Splunk $token".
    Alternatively, basic authentication with username and password using curl -u is
    supported.'

  - The TrackMe REST API endpoint for testing remote connectivity requires a bearer
    token passed in the request body. Specifically, when calling the `/services/trackme/v2/configuration/test_remote_connectivity`
    endpoint via POST, include a `bearer_token` parameter in the JSON body along with
    `target_endpoints` and `app_namespace`.
