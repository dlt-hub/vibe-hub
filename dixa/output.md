In this guide, we'll set up a complete Dixa data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def dixa_conversations_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://dev.dixa.io/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "apikey",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "conversations",
            "anonymization",
            "endpoints"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='dixa_conversations_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='dixa_conversations_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(dixa_conversations_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from dixa_conversations‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Conversations: Manage and retrieve data related to conversations, including logs, messages, and creating new conversations.
- Anonymization: Request and schedule anonymization of conversations to ensure privacy and compliance.
- Endpoints: Manage contact endpoints, retrieve lists, and specific details.
- Flows and Queues: Handle flow configurations and queue management, retrieve current flows and list queues.
- Users and Tags: Manage user accounts, retrieve user information, and manage tags associated with conversations.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Dixa workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@dixa_conversations-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Dixa support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:dixa_conversations duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@dixa_conversations-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Dixa API, as specified in @dixa_conversations-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "conversations" and "anonymization" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in dixa_conversations_pipeline.py and name the pipeline dixa_conversations_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python dixa_conversations_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is accomplished using an API key which is passed via the Authorization header. The key should be included in every request to the API.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.dixa.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python dixa_conversations_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline dixa_conversations load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset dixa_conversations_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/dixa_conversations.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline dixa_conversations_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("dixa_conversations_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "conversations" table as Pandas frame
   data."conversations".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

All Dixa API endpoints are rate limited, and exceeding these limits is monitored but not considered misuse. However, rate limits are subject to change. Additionally, each query cannot span more than 31 days, and the export messages endpoint does not include internal notes. Error handling is essential, especially for 4XX and 5XX HTTP errors where certain types might not be retried.
