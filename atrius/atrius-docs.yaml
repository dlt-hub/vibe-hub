notes:
- An Atrius user account with 'Administrator' access is required.
- A registered OAuth2.0 client app in Atrius is necessary.
- An authorization token created with your registered OAuth2.0 client is required.
- Deleting a building cannot be undone
- Certain countries cannot use postal codes
- Requires a registered OAuth2.0 client app in Atrius.
- Arcadia is an energy data company that enables the integration and automation of
  utility invoice and smart meter data.
- Uses HTTPS POST with CSV data format
- Only the Property Data Administrator can authorize data exchange with third-parties
  like Atrius.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Each ESPM property is owned by a Property Data Administrator. You must be using
  the Property Data Administrator account for all ESPM integration steps.
- Sending Monthly Usage is required.
- Sending Estimated Cost is optional and only applies to non-bill points.
- Sending Historical Data is optional.
- By default, Atrius will automatically create a new Energy Star point with a “by
  Building Insights” identifier in both Atrius and ESPM.
- Make sure that your formula is inputted correctly, with the correct syntax and Atrius
  IDs of the input points you wish to use in the calculation.
- Make sure that all input points are reporting expected data. If 'Partial calculation'
  is disabled, then all input points must have readings in order for the calculated
  point to compute a value.
- Totaled Points are designed to simplify and automate the creation of whole building
  resource totals.
- They always represent Whole Building scope and are not editable.
- If multiple points for a given resource in a building have Add to building totals
  enabled, a new Totaled point is generated to aggregate the input points and represent
  the whole building resource total.
- Create reminders for efficient task management
- Monitor task completion all in one place
- If a task assignee is deactivated or deleted, no emails for recurring tasks will
  be sent.
- Work orders data will be automatically updated in the app, depending on the frequency
  with which data are pushed from your external work order management system.
- Validation threshold can be updated in the point's Profile tab in Atrius.
- If no market-based factor is assigned, Atrius will automatically copy the location-based
  factor over as a back up.
- Competitions are resource-specific. You’ll need to configure separate competitions
  for electricity, natural gas, and water.
- The most common reason for unexpectedly high or low reduction values is due to what
  stage the of the competition you are in.
- Percent reduction results will not populate until the competition has begun.
- You can edit both the competition period and baseline period after the competition
  starts.
- To create a Competition Rankings card, the competition must already exist in Atrius.
- Administrator access is required.
- Atrius supports SAML 2-based Okta integrations.
- 'Atrius requires the following password strength policy: Password must not be the
  same as the username; Password must include at least 3 of the following: 1 number,
  1 special character (!@#$%^&*+), 1 upper case letter, 1 lower case letter; Password
  must be at least 8 characters long; Password must be unique for at least the past
  13 passwords; Account is locked for 30 minutes after 5 login attempts.'
- Planning ahead is the key to running a successful competition.
- Leave enough time for planning.
- Set your baseline to a 2-, 3-, or 4-week period directly before your competition.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Atrius
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- New features and updates for emissions, points, bills, cards, and integrations.
- Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via an email verification code.
- Emissions app provides filterable tables of your buildings' emissions and default
  eGRID emission rates.
