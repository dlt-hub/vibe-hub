auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-examples/:
  - Basic authentication is required for the Jira REST API. Pass an auth filter to
    restkit (or equivalent HTTP client) containing credentials, which will be sent
    as HTTP Basic Auth headers with each request. The example shows using filters=[auth]
    in a Resource call to handle credential transmission automatically.
  - 'Basic authentication is required, using username and password provided via the
    `-u` flag in curl format, which translates to the Authorization header with base64-encoded
    credentials (e.g., `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`).'
  - Basic authentication is used to authenticate API requests. Credentials are passed
    via the `-u` flag in curl (username:password format) or as an Authorization header
    with base64-encoded credentials. For example, `-u charlie:charlie` authenticates
    as user "charlie" with password "charlie". In Python, this would be passed as
    the `auth` parameter to requests using a tuple like `auth=('charlie', 'charlie')`.
- information_source; https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/basic-authentication/:
  - 'Basic authentication is supported by sending a username and password with each
    request. Construct the authorization header by Base64-encoding a string in the
    format username:password, then send it as Authorization: Basic {encoded-string}.
    Alternatively, use the -u username:password argument in cURL or equivalent in
    other HTTP clients. OAuth is recommended as a more secure token-based alternative
    to basic authentication.'
- information_source; https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-search/:
  - OAuth 2.0 is required for this Jira API endpoint. Use either classic scope read:jira-work
    or granular scopes including read:issue-details:jira, read:field-default-value:jira,
    read:field.option:jira, read:field:jira, and read:group:jira. For Connect apps,
    use READ scope. Send the OAuth 2.0 access token in the Authorization header as
    a Bearer token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-examples/:
  - Pagination uses startAt (query parameter, optional, default 0) to specify the
    starting index, maxResults (query parameter, optional, default 50) to limit results
    per page, and total (response field) to indicate total available issues. Continue
    paginating by incrementing startAt by maxResults until startAt plus returned results
    equals total.
  - The search endpoint uses offset-based pagination with startAt (query parameter,
    default 0) and maxResults (query parameter, default 50) to request pages. The
    response includes startAt, maxResults, and total fields to indicate pagination
    state; construct the next request by incrementing startAt by maxResults until
    startAt plus maxResults exceeds total.
- information_source; https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-search/:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with the query parameter nextPageToken (a
    string) to retrieve subsequent pages. The response includes an isLast boolean
    field to indicate when the final page is reached; continue paginating by passing
    the nextPageToken value from the current response until isLast is true.
  - Use the request body parameter nextPageToken (string) to paginate through search
    results. The response includes a nextPageToken field; pass this value in the nextPageToken
    parameter of the next request to retrieve subsequent pages. Stop paginating when
    nextPageToken is absent or null in the response.
  - maxResults and startAt are query/body parameters for pagination. maxResults (integer)
    specifies the number of results per page, startAt (integer) specifies the starting
    index for results. The response returns SearchResults containing the paginated
    data; use the startAt value plus maxResults to construct the next request until
    all results are retrieved.
