  - 'Authenticate with a bearer token in the Authorization header. Call the Authentication
    endpoint first to obtain a token for API access, then include it as "Authorization:
    Bearer {token}" in all subsequent requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses bearer tokens. Include the token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests. The API returns 401 for missing
    or invalid credentials and 403 for insufficient permissions.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header when making requests to this endpoint.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the bearer token in the Authorization

    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" to access the endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.klarpay.com/docs:
  - Pagination is available on two payment query endpoints. The new `/api/payment/filter-extended`
    endpoint accepts query parameters pageSize and pageNo, returning totalCount in
    the response. The existing `/api/payment/filter` endpoint supports the same pagination
    via headers x-page-size, x-page-no, and x-total-count.
  - Pagination uses pageNo and pageSize parameters in the request body. The response
    includes meta object with pageSize, pageNo, totalCount, and resultCount fields
    to track pagination state.
  - The response includes pagination metadata with pageSize (50), pageNo (1), totalCount
    (1), and resultCount (1). To paginate, use pageNo as a query parameter in subsequent
    requests, incrementing it to retrieve additional pages until resultCount is less
    than pageSize or totalCount is reached.
- information_source; https://api.klarpay.com/docs/swagger.json:
  - Pagination is implemented via response headers for the filter transactions endpoint.
    The POST /api/payment/filter endpoint returns x-page-no, x-page-size, x-result-count,
    and x-total-count headers to indicate current page number, page size, result count,
    and total count respectively. The request body schema (FilterTransactionsDto)
    likely contains pagination parameters, but their exact names are not specified
    in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'Pagination uses header-based response fields: x-page-no (page number), x-page-size
    (page size), x-result-count (current result count), and x-total-count (total count).
    No request parameters for pagination are specified in the documented endpoint.'
