auth_info:
- information_source; https://dsj23.me/2024/07/24/authenticating-rest-api-calls-in-ifs-workflows/:
  - Basic authentication uses a base64-encoded concatenation of username and password
    sent in the Authorization header as "Basic " + base64(username:password). Bearer
    token authentication follows OAuth2 Client Credentials flow, requiring a token
    request with client_id, client_secret, and scope parameters to obtain a token
    that is then sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer " + token.
  - 'HTTP authentication is handled via the Authorization header. For basic authentication,
    credentials (username:password) must be base64-encoded and sent as Authorization:
    Basic [BASE64_encoded_credentials]. The IFS REST Call workflow delegate accepts
    an optional Headers parameter where you can include the Authorization header with
    either basic authentication or bearer token format, configured manually within
    the workflow using a Script delegate to encode credentials as needed.'
  - IFS Rest API uses OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. Create an auth body
    with client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to 'client_credentials', and scope
    set to 'openid', then POST to the token endpoint (typically https://YourDomain.ifs.cloud/auth/realms/YourSystemID/protocol/openid-connect/token)
    to obtain an access token. Include the token in subsequent API requests using
    the Authorization header with format 'Bearer {token}'.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain a bearer token. Send a POST request
    with client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to 'client_credentials', and scope
    'openid' in the request body. Extract the access_token from the JSON response
    and use it in the Authorization header as 'Bearer {access_token}'.
  - Service User Authentication uses OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow to obtain an access
    token from IFS Cloud. The token is then used in REST API calls via the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token, allowing requests to be made as a service user rather
    than a logged-in user.
