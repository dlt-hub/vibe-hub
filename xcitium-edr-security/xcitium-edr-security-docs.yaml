notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Endpoint security monitoring in the cloud is simplified and more accurate, thanks
  to its centralized, managed architecture.
- Predictive models enable local systems to foresee new threats and avert unknown
  malicious behavior without signatures or pre-existing knowledge of the specific
  threat.
- Some operations may require specific endpoint configurations
- EDR solutions provide proactive protection by identifying unusual behavior, patterns,
  and anomalies.
- Comprehensive visibility into all endpoints.
- Rapid response by automatically isolating infected devices.
- EDR security solutions provide real-time threat detection and response.
- EDR systems significantly reduce dwell time by detecting anomalies and threats in
  real time.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in xcitium
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- OAuth2 with refresh token required for access
- Xcitium exists to ensure that people can embrace technology fully, without the shadow
  of insecurity hanging over them.
- Make HTTPS your only option
- Implement rate limiting
- Cybersecurity is a fundamental right, not a privilege.
