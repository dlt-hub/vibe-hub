Here's a YAML configuration for the `posthog_analytics` REST API source based on the provided documentation:

client:
  base_url: "https://app.posthog.com/api/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"

resources:
  - name: "projects"
    endpoint: "/projects"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.results"  # Assuming the expected response contains results

  - name: "annotations"
    endpoint: "/annotations"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.results"  # Assuming the expected response contains results

  - name: "cohorts"
    endpoint: "/cohorts"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.results"  # Assuming the expected response contains results

  - name: "events"
    endpoint: "/events"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.results"  # Assuming the expected response contains results

  - name: "feature_flags"
    endpoint: "/feature_flags"
    method: "GET"
    params: {}
    data_selector: "$.results"  # Assuming the expected response contains results

notes:
  - "Authentication is done using an API key. Include the key in the request headers under 'Authorization'."
  - "Rate limits may apply to all analytical endpoints, requiring throttling of API calls or reducing request frequency."
  - "Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions to access the endpoints."

errors:
  - 401  # Unauthorized
  - 403  # Forbidden
  - 429  # Too Many Requests

auth_info:
  mentioned_objects:
    - "API key requirements"
    - "Authentication methods"

source_metadata:
  description: "The PostHog API provides endpoints to manage and retrieve information about projects, annotations, cohorts, events, and feature flags for analytics."
### Explanation of the YAML structure:
1. **Client Configuration**: The `base_url` is extracted from the documentation, and the authentication method is specified as an API key.
  
2. **Resources**: A list of endpoints is provided with the assumed endpoints extracted from the context. The `data_selector` is set to `$.results`, which is a common pattern in APIs where data is returned in a JSON object under a "results" key.

3. **Notes**: Important notes about authentication, rate limits, and permissions are included.

4. **Errors**: Common error codes relevant to the API are listed.

5. **Auth Info**: This section mentions the requirements for API keys and authentication methods.

6. **Source Metadata**: A brief description of the API's purpose is included.
