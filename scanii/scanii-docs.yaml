  - 'Scanii API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key and secret. Credentials
    are passed as a colon-separated pair (key:secret) in the Authorization header
    using the Basic scheme, as shown in the curl example: -u 8eb05c68f386421db2dd4929fc4f77ad:12345678.
    Authentication tokens can be generated for temporary, time-bound access to third
    parties, but tokens cannot generate other tokens or access administrative resources.'
  - 'Scanii API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials consist of an API key
    and a secret, provided as username and password respectively in the Authorization
    header using the format username:password encoded in base64. Example: API key
    "8eb05c68f386421db2dd4929fc4f77ad" with secret "12345678" is sent via curl''s
    -u flag or as an Authorization header with value "Basic base64(8eb05c68f386421db2dd4929fc4f77ad:12345678)".'
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a client ID and secret (username:password
    format). To obtain a temporary token, POST to the auth/tokens endpoint with Basic
    Auth credentials; the response includes an id, creation_date, and expiration_date.
    The token timeout is configurable via an optional timeout parameter (defaults
    to 300 seconds).
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials consist of a username (API
    key) and password, sent via the Authorization header using the format "username:password"
    encoded in base64. Example: curl -u 8eb05c68f386421db2dd4929fc4f77ad:12345678
    demonstrates passing the API key as username and a token/secret as password for
    Basic auth.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials consist of an API key and
    secret (e.g., `8eb05c68f386421db2dd4929fc4f77ad:12345678`), passed via the `-u`
    flag in curl, which translates to an `Authorization: Basic` header with base64-encoded
    credentials in the format `key:secret`.'
