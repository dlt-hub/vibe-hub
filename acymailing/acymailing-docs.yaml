notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Not all data can be migrated, only global statistics are imported.

- If a case is not covered yet, don't hesitate to let us know by using the contact
  form on our website 🙂
- You can install the free version of AcyMailing directly from your website by searching
  for AcyMailing in the available extensions.
- If you have other languages installed in Joomla, then AcyMailing will detect them
  and automatically installed the related language files.
- If you have other languages installed in WordPress, then AcyMailing will detect
  them and will automatically install the related language files.
- Joomla has a dedicated page to update extensions.
- If the update fails, you may want to do it manually. In this case, download the
  latest version from our website, and install it like any other extension from the
  menu Plugins => Add New Plugin with the Upload Plugin button.
- You do not need to uninstall the previous version, just install the new version
  over it. Your data won't be lost, only the AcyMailing files will be updated.
- Note that you don't need to uninstall the AcyMailing module/component/plugins, they
  will automatically be uninstalled if you uninstall the package.
- The AcyMailing data will still be present in your database, so if you re-install
  it, you won't lose any data (apart from your images).
- If you wish to completely uninstall AcyMailing and remove all its data, execute
  the SQL query shown in the confirmation message.
- If you wish to completely uninstall AcyMailing and remove all its data, you will
  need to remove the tables prefixed with 'xxx_acym_' in your database.

  Here are some step by step guides to help you do this without having to worry about
  data loss.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The latest version of AcyMailing must be installed on both Joomla! and WordPress
  websites
- Attachments added to newsletters cannot be migrated correctly due to differing structures
- Update AcyMailing to its latest version on the origin website
- During the install process, some options will be automatically set from your website
  configuration but you can modify them at any time.
- It's always better to unlink the license directly from your website, this way your
  AcyMailing configuration stays correct.
- By default AcyMailing doesn't allow ümlauts or Chinese/Cyrillic characters in email
  addresses, you can activate this option to allow any character.
- AcyMailing can connect to an external delivery service (SMTP, SendGrid, Sendinblue,
  Mailgun, Amazon SES).
- If none of your ports are opened and your host does not want to open any, then you
  can still use the REST API integration with ElasticEmail.
- When the cron triggers your website, you can enable some reports via e-mail or log
  file.
- If you use the free version, the send process can only be triggered manually.
- Be careful with these options, if you set too many batches your server might not
  be able to keep up.
- AcyMailing uses a queue to send emails.
- If the message cannot be sent immediately, it will be kept in the queue.
- 'Queue processing: Automatic Only'

  of your site.

  on your AcyMailing subscription forms in order to only allow human subscriptions.
- The multilingual option lets you create multiple versions of the same campaign when
  editing one.
- The option Translate content is for now only used for WordPress and allows you to
  translate automatically in the right language the posts and page content in your
  campaign with Polylang or WPML.
- Most of language files are included in the package so during the AcyMailing installation
  process, the translations are automatically installed.
- In case that a language isn't included, you simply have to go on the AcyMailing
  Configuration page, tab 'Language' and create your own language.
- Sharing a language file is very important so that we can include your language file
  in our next versions.
