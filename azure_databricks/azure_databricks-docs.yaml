  - Subscription keys must be provided via the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header when
    testing APIs through the Azure API Management portal. For calls to Databricks
    model serving endpoints, Databricks Personal Access Tokens can be used for authentication,
    though the specific authentication mechanism (JWT, OAuth, or other schemes) should
    be determined based on enterprise strategy.

  : - API Key Authentication is required. The API expects a custom header with a name
      specified in the APIM Subscription settings (the "Header Name" value). The API
      key value is generated and managed through APIM Subscriptions; retrieve the
      key from the APIM Subscriptions blade and pass it in the designated header.
      Alternatively, Bearer token authentication is also available as an option.
