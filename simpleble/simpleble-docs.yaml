- The project is free to use for non-commercial purposes, but requires a commercial
  license for commercial use.

  - reach out to discuss your use case!
- BlueZ compatibility should ensure broad support, but Ubuntu is the primary tested
  platform.
- This code is currently under active development and some features are not yet implemented
  or their API might change, but should be enough to help you get started.
- Don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance - we're happy to help!
