auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.lansweeper.com/docs/data-api/get-started/quickstart/:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Download client_id and client_secret
    credentials when creating an app. Exchange the authorization code (obtained after
    user authorization, valid for one use) for tokens via POST to https://api.lansweeper.com/api/integrations/oauth/token
    with JSON body containing client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "authorization_code",
    and code parameter.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow using POST requests to https://api.lansweeper.com/api/integrations/oauth/token.
    Send a JSON body with client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "refresh_token",
    and the refresh_token value to obtain a new access_token when the current one
    expires.
  - Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication is required. Generate a PAT in Lansweeper
    Settings under Developer tools, then include it in the Authorization header as
    "Token YOUR_PAT" when making requests to https://api.lansweeper.com/api/v2/graphql
    with Content-Type header set to application/json.
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as ''Authorization: Bearer <token>'' where the token is a JWT. The token
    is obtained separately and must be included in all GraphQL requests to https://api.lansweeper.com/api/v2/graphql.'
  - 'The Lansweeper GraphQL API uses bearer token authentication. Send an `Authorization`
    header with the value `Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP` to the endpoint
    `https://api.lansweeper.com/api/v2/graphql`. The access token must be obtained
    in a previous step (not detailed in this excerpt). Also include `Content-type:
    application/json` header.'
