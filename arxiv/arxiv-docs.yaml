auth_info:
- information_source; https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03841v1:
  - Authentication is achieved through bearer tokens or optional mutual TLS (mTLS).
    Bearer tokens are sent in request headers, while mTLS provides certificate-based
    authentication at the transport layer. Message integrity is reinforced through
    JSON Web Signatures (JWS) on message parts, and key management relies on JWTs
    or local certificate storage depending on deployment context.
