notes:
- This guide will evolve as a mechanism to document C++ APIs wrapped in Python is
  developed.
- Changes to this document must be approved by the System Architect.
- Doxygen will not properly parse parameter descriptions that have multiple paragraphs.
- If the template parameters require a lengthy explanation, put the explanation in
  the Extended Summary and refer to it from the parameter descriptions.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
