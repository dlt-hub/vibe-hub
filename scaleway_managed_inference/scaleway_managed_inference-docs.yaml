auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/:
  - Scaleway API uses token-based authentication via the X-Auth-Token HTTP header.
    Each request requires the X-Auth-Token header containing your API key secret,
    which you can generate from the Scaleway console and optionally store in the SCW_SECRET_KEY
    environment variable for use in requests.
  - The API uses token-based authentication via the X-Auth-Token header. Include the
    header X-Auth-Token with your Scaleway secret key (SCW_SECRET_KEY environment
    variable) in all requests to authenticate.
  - The Scaleway API requires authentication via the X-Auth-Token header, which should
    contain your SCW_SECRET_KEY (the API key). API keys inherit IAM permissions from
    their associated user or application, with full rights if associated with an Organization
    Owner, otherwise limited by defined policies.

  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Set the
    environment variable SCW_SECRET_KEY to your API secret key, then include it in
    requests as "Authorization: Bearer $SCW_SECRET_KEY" in the header. The SCW_REGION
    environment variable specifies the Scaleway region for the API endpoint.'

  - 'The API uses token-based authentication via the X-Auth-Token header. Include
    the header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" in all requests, where SCW_SECRET_KEY
    is your Scaleway secret API key stored as an environment variable.'
