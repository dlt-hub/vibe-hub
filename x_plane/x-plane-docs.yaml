  auth: The snippets mention that clients can ask X-Plane for authorization to connect,
    and the user will receive an authorization request popup asking if they want to
    allow the application to connect, but do not provide specific details regarding
    keys, tokens, client id, client secret, or any other auth information.
  most_recurring_base_url: http://localhost:8086
  paginator: Pagination is required, and it can be applied using the `start` parameter
    to specify the index from where to start, inclusive, and the `limit` parameter
    to determine how many results to return.
