notes:
- API Functions enable you to create custom API endpoints using traditional Functions.
- Request and response sizes are both limited to 6 Megabytes, after conversion to
  the standardized formats.
- API Functions are limited to a timeLimit of 30 seconds.
- Browsers are quite restrictive when it comes to deciding where your frontend application
  can fetch data from.
- Managing CORS headers is not something that our customers are able to do themselves
  yet.
- Tasks can be scheduled to run at a future moment.
- Tasks can trigger other tasks, including themselves.
- RQL pagination improved — maximum page size is 100.
- The Postman collection contains some logic to facilitate using the endpoints.
- The ExtraHorizon CLI is currently in Beta
- RQL provides the ability to filter, sort, paginate, and project data.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Our teams can provide support in English, French and Dutch.
- Any single API call can run for 60 seconds before timing out.
- The size of the body of any API request is limited to 10MB.
- A task execution will timeout after 5 minutes.
- The size of the data supplied to a task should not exceed 250KB.
- File uploads to the file service are limited to files of 8MB.
- Invoices are payable within fourteen (14) calendar days from the invoice date.
- All payments made by the Client to Extra Horizon under the Agreement shall be final
  and non-refundable.
- If the Client fails to pay any undisputed sums when due, Extra Horizon shall be
  entitled to interest on the amount due compounded monthly at the rate of eight percent
  (8%) per month or the maximum permitted by applicable law.
- To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Client agrees that Extra
  Horizon, its board members, officers, employees and agents shall only be liable
  for any direct damages resulting from the Agreement.
- Nothing in the Agreement shall operate to exclude or limit either Party’s liability
  for fraud or willful misconduct.
- Tasks can give you insights into when the function will be executed and provide
  insights into the success or failure of the execution.
- The dispatcher service currently supports two types of actions (a mail and task
  action).
- All API endpoints only respond to authenticated requests.
- A request is considered authenticated when it carries a valid authentication token.
- The Authentication service supports both OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 standards.
- Make sure to only include essential dependencies as there is a 10MB limit for the
  entire size of your code.
- In case you need to create functions larger than 10MB you can use docker.
- Extra Horizon Task Functions are based on AWS Lambda.
- When using a docker-based task, do not use the exh-cli to manage your task (create/update).
- By default Extra Horizon uses the hash mode for account activation.
- Group roles allow specific permissions to be granted to users in the context of
  a group.
- Patients cannot attach additional permissions.
