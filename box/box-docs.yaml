auth_info:
- information_source; https://box.dev/reference/v2025.0/post-external-users-submit-delete-job/:
  - 'Authorization requires a bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Send
    the request with header "Authorization: bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" where ACCESS_TOKEN
    is a valid Box API access token.'
- information_source; https://box.dev/llms-full.txt:
  - 'A Developer Token is a short-lived Access Token that expires after 60 minutes
    and cannot be refreshed programmatically. It is sent in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token in API requests, for example: Authorization: Bearer [DEVELOPER_TOKEN].
    Developer Tokens are generated via the Box Developer Console and are associated
    with the logged-in user; they are intended only for development and testing, not
    production use.'
  - A string auth token is required and passed to the token parameter. The token should
    be generated with appropriate scopes including base_preview for preview access,
    and optional feature scopes such as item_download for downloads, annotation_view_self
    to view own annotations, and annotation_view_all to view all annotations on the
    file.
  - Access Tokens are the primary credentials for Box API authentication. OAuth 2.0
    authentication returns an Access Token and Refresh Token pair obtained by POSTing
    to https://api.box.com/oauth2/token with content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    The documentation also mentions JWT and CCG as alternative authentication methods,
    and supports as-user calls when the appropriate scope is configured, allowing
    impersonation of other users via subsequent API calls.
  - 'Access to enterprise events requires admin permissions. API requests must include
    Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header with format "Authorization:
    Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://box.dev/llms-full.txt:
  - Events objects are returned in pages with a chunk_size parameter indicating the
    number of events in each page and a stream_position field to query the next page.
  - Limit is a query parameter for the GetArchivesV2025R0 method with a default or
    example value of 100, indicating offset-limit based pagination where Limit controls
    the number of results per request.
  - Limit parameter in query string controls page size for listing Box Sign templates.
    Response returns SignTemplates collection; continue fetching with updated Limit
    value for subsequent pages.
  - Marker-based pagination is used with a `next_marker` value returned in the response
    body to indicate more results are available. Use the `next_marker` from the response
    as the marker parameter in the next request to fetch additional pages.
  - Marker-based pagination is used with optional `marker` parameter defining the
    position to begin returning results (requires `usemarker` set to true) and optional
    `limit` parameter specifying maximum items per page. The response is of type `FileVersionLegalHolds`
    which contains pagination details for navigation.
