notes:
- The local API is designed to receive HTTP requests from your internal network only.
- By default the ThinkAutomation Server accepts local API requests from local IP addresses
  only.
- The secure URL (https) will display a certificate warning message in the web browser
  because the ThinkAutomation Server uses a self-signed certificate by default.
- ThinkAutomation is a self-managed solution, which means it can be deployed either
  on-premises or on a private-cloud virtual machine of your choice.
- ThinkAutomation is a self-managed application that runs in your own environment.
- A default Solution will have been created.
- The Message Source Schedule defaults to every 2 minutes.
- The new Message Source and Automation will then appear in the Explorer.
- When a new Message Source is saved it will be disabled by default.
- POP3 is an older and slower protocol than IMAP and does not provide an option to
  only download new messages since the last download.
- SMTP Server option must be enabled in the Server settings.
- The web form is hosted on Microsoft Azure and is served via HTTPS only - meaning
  all form submissions are encrypted.
- Users can enter their Name, Email Address, and Subject before starting a chat session.
- Files greater than 50MB will only pass file details to the Automation.
- API POST requests will respond with a 202 Accepted status as soon as the message
  has been queued.
- API GET requests will respond with a 202 Accepted status as soon as the message
  has been queued.
- Messages are shown in pages of 1000 messages per page.
- Logs will be removed if you manually remove messages from the Message Store.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- When creating your first Extract Field action it is a good idea to paste a sample
  copy of the message body you are extracting data from into the Helper Message box.
- Directory will be created if it does not exist.
- Folder names can contain letters and numbers only.
- The UPDATE and SELECT commands will only be created if you have defined one or more
  of your Extracted Fields as Key Fields.
- You must specify a Connection String that ThinkAutomation will use to open the database.
- Databases are global to the ThinkAutomation instance.
- The maximum number of articles in the Embedded Knowledge Store should be less than
  10,000.
- You can attach files to outgoing messages.
- If any of the attachment files do not exist, the action will throw an error and
  the email will not be sent.
- Rate limits may apply based on AI provider settings.
- Uses AES encryption for Encrypting and Decrypting text or files.
- Default encoding method for encryption is base64.
- Key length must be 256, 192 or 128 bits.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Ensure to replace {AccountSid} with your actual Twilio Account SID.
- API responses may vary based on account permissions.
- Requires a Twilio account with verified phone numbers.
- Specify your Azure Storage Account Name and Access Key to connect.
- You can use %variable% replacements for Partition Key and Row Key.
- Each action must have a unique Class Name. This must be less than 100 characters
  and must not contain spaces or special characters.
- Custom actions will not appear in the Actions toolbox until marked as 'Published'
- Solution package files are encrypted and cannot be read outside the ThinkAutomation
  Studio, so package files are safe to be sent by email.
- The Web API Gateway server does not hold any of your settings, or keep copies of
  messages it has forwarded to your ThinkAutomation Server.
- Using Office 365 SMTP requires an App Password in some cases.
- The Queue Size setting is not applicable if you are using SendGrid.
- Each day at the times specified the ThinkAutomation Server will delete processed
  messages according to the Keep Messages For (Days) setting on each of your Solutions.
- You should specify multiple times on high usage implementations to split up the
  delete operations.
- Any log records older than the Log Retention Maximum Days setting will be deleted
  during message store maintenance.
- You can disable the automatic deletion of Message Store messages for all Solutions
  by enabling the Disable Message Store Database Maintenance option.
- If the Backup Solution Settings In Message Store option is enabled then ThinkAutomation
  will automatically store copies of your Solutions in the Message Store database.
- The Message Processor Service starts 4 separate tasks for Automation processing
  by default.
- You can create any number of Global Constants that can be used on any Automation
  within any Solution.
- The Client Websocket Port is the port used by the ThinkAutomation Studio, ThinkAutomation
  Desktop Connector and Message Reader.
- The HTTPS/HTTP ports are used by the local HTTP API.
- The default ports are 9899 (HTTP) and 9898 (HTTPS).
- The SMTP Server is disabled by default.
- The Host Name Or IP Address entry should be set to the IP address/name that the
  SMTP server should listen on.
- By default this is 'localhost' and should not need to be changed.
- The Listen On Port entry defines the port number.
- This defaults to 587.
- The ThinkAutomation SMTP Server supports various ESMTP extensions.
- You can disable the Web API for your ThinkAutomation Server if required.
- If the Can Create/Edit Message Sources & Automations user right is disabled, the
  user will not be able to add or edit Message Sources or Automations using the Studio.
- For non-administrator users you can restrict access to specific Solutions.
- ThinkAutomation can save changes made to your Automations allowing you to Revert
  to a previous version.
- The default logging level can be overridden using the Set Logging Level action inside
  individual Automations.
- Any Comment actions that have the Show In Log option enabled will always be logged,
  regardless of the logging level.
- You can use Markdown for the message text in outgoing emails sent using the Send
  Email action.
- OAuth is the recommended connection method for Microsoft Dynamics.
- The Embedded database enables fast and easy storage & retrieval of data & files
  in your Automations without any additional setup.
- The Embedded Database is 'schemaless' meaning the schema does not need to be pre-defined.
- Extract Field action allows you to extract at a specific Json path.
- You can enable the Extract All Array Values To CSV option.
- You can use the For Each action to loop on Json members.
- OAuth is the recommended connection method.
- Database files are created when a database is first accessed.
- Database files can be encrypted using AES by specifying a password.
- Once a database has been created its password cannot be changed.
- Data is inserted in Json format. Each 'record' is a Json Document.
- Each document must have a '_id' field with a unique value.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- TACopy communicates with the ThinkAutomation Server using https on port 9898.
- You need to ensure that any remote IP's are added to the ThinkAutomation Whitelist
  in the ThinkAutomation Server Settings and ensure that port 9898 is open on the
  ThinkAutomation Server firewall.
- Requires setup of database tables for Emails, Attachments, and Orders.
- Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) server capabilities.
- Supports multiple AI Providers such as OpenAI and OptimaGPT.
- 'The ''To'' phone number must always be the full international format (eg: +4477991234567)'
- You can buy a local number for as little as $1 per month
- Results are returned as CSV text to the CSV variable (there is also the option of
  returning as Json or Markdown).
- Database and collection will be automatically created when the first record is added.
- Twitter Message Sources now require a paid developer account (Basic or Pro).
- Added App-Only access option for Office 365 logins.
- Fixed issue with Run A Report action. The report designer crashed if an external
  Excel or CSV data source was added.
- Fixed issue with IMAP Message Source not reading new messages after first run when
  connected to certain IMAP servers.
- ThinkAutomation Version 5 is not directly compatible with ThinkAutomation Version
  4.
- The Developer Edition is a free edition aimed at Developers/ISV's who want to create
  Solutions for their own customers.
