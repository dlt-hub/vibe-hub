  URL. The new URL is `http://x.x.x.x:5200/httpjson_aws_waf/`.
- Keep in mind that the global Status filters available at the left of most Stellar
  Cyber tables (All Open, New, In Progress, Ignored, and Closed) apply only to security
  events (alerts). They do not apply to cases.
- Lookup strings for hash values should not include the SHA= or MD5= prefix. Enter
  these strings using just the hash value itself.
- Some alerts may not be assigned an alert score.
- High load errors can prevent closing alerts.
- Epoch timestamps may be missing milliseconds.
- Changing any parameter in a sensor profile (for example, changing port settings
  or disabling modules) causes the Tenable Nessus linking key to become invalid.
- TLS is not correctly enabled on customized parser ports.
- Importing security rules via the Import Custom Security Rules page might cause the
  upload process to hang without providing a status update.
- A query might not produce consistent search results if the field is set for a time,
  the value includes milliseconds, and the operator is set as is or is not.
- When searching the Asset Analytics tab for an IP address, make sure you set the
  Search Column to Friendly Name, IP, or IP History.
- The Cylance responder is unable to perform the Contain Host action due to a limitation
  in the Cylance REST API.
- Windows Server Sensor installation can trigger the installation of Microsoft Visual
  C++ on the host machine if it isn't installed already.
- The Log Forwarder only collects statistics for up to 100 different log source IP
  addresses per Log Forwarder worker.
- When multiple traffic filters are defined for a tenant with the same combination
  of IP address, port, protocol, and layer 7 rules, the filter might fail to take
  effect.
- If you change the network interface configuration of a sensor VM after deployment,
  the eth0 interface might be remapped to a new interface.
- The Sensor content type for the Cybereason connector requires the System Admin role
  and Sensor Admin L1 role to collect.
- Due to an ongoing issue with the Cybereason Query Sensors API, the Cybereason connector
  might not always be able to retrieve host IP addresses.
- When a new tenant is onboarded, the rare-type alerts triggered may have an unusually
  large days_silent and a higher than usual fidelity.
- If you use a Cynet connector to perform a Contain Host or Shutdown Host on a host
  that is already disabled, shutdown, or otherwise not reachable, Cynet returns a
  status that the request was successful.
- Operators are enabled in pick list menus when they are supported with the selected
  field or rule.
- Log Forwarder only collects statistics for limited different log source IP addresses
  per Log Forwarder worker.
- When a modular sensor is configured as a Log Forwarder-only sensor, the Log Forwarder
  might periodically restart if there isn't enough sensor memory.
- A modular sensor upgrade will fail when the associated modular sensor profile has
  the IDS or Sandbox features enabled and the corresponding feature license is not
  assigned to the sensor.
- When multiple traffic filters in different tenants are defined with the same combination
  of IP, port, protocol, and layer 7 rules, the sensor only takes the filter belonging
  to the same tenant with the sensor and ignores the others.
- Files might not be assembled by Security Data Sensors for traffic mirrored from
  physical interfaces on Cisco Nexus 9K models.
- If you configure a sensor aggregator using its hostname instead of its IP address,
  you can not see the aggregator in the Sensor List.
- Deleting Elasticsearch data from the Root Tenant in the System | Data Management
  | Advanced tab deletes data from sub-tenants.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Stellar Cyber
- Access to the API is only available using local user accounts. Single-sign on (SSO)
  users cannot access the API with their SSO credentials.
- Includes more than 250 playbook templates for automated responses.
- ATH playbooks run on a fixed schedule or interval.
- When a playbook runs over all selected tenants, it limits the total returned results
  to a global maximum of 5,000 Interflow records across all tenants.
- When it runs per tenant, it retrieves no more than 100 records per tenant.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Deduplication can be based on multiple fields joined with a logical AND.
- Deduplicates custom alerts by discarding fields that are always different between
  separate alerts
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- User account must have API privileges
- The password should not include non-ASCII special characters.

- Stellar Cyber recommends that you do not use the same login credentials to configure
  Azure or Azure Active Directory connectors for multiple tenants in the same company.
- The Sensor content type for the Cybereason connector requires the System Admin role
  and Sensor Admin L1 role.
- When a new tenant is onboarded, the rare-type alerts may have an unusually large
  days_silent and a higher than usual fidelity.
- When multiple traffic filters in different tenants are defined with the same combination
  of IP, port, protocol, and layer 7 rules, the sensor only takes the filter belonging
