notes:
- Most of our integrations require you to have a CloudTruth API access token.
- Copy your access token now and secure it in a safe place. The token is only available
  at initial creation and will need to be regenerated if it is lost.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Copilot helps you evaluate templates against well-architected frameworks.
- Copilot does not share your configuration data with outside parties.
- Organization users must be an Owner or Admin to access the Audit logs.
- Each CloudTruth Organization starts with a default project MyFirstProject.
- CloudTruth Actions allow you to sync secrets and parameters with your external sources.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in CloudTruth
- The plugin is enabled for your argocd application in a gitops fashion by creating
  the file .argocd-cloudtruth-plugin in the root of your Application's repo.
- You must use an Office 365 business account. You cannot use a personal Outlook account
  to register.
- Add your generated CloudTruth API access token as a Bitbucket repository variable
  named CLOUDTRUTH_API_KEY in your Repository settings > Pipelines > Repository variables.
- Run your tutorial Docker image and pass in the CloudTruth API key to allow CloudTruth
  to authenticate in the container instance.
- You have created a CloudTruth API token
- You have created a CloudTruth API Access token.
- Harness requires a working Kubernetes cluster to deploy applications.
- Jenkins will automatically mask built in credentials parameters like the CloudTruth
  API key.
- KubeTruth integrates with CloudTruth providing you an automated K8s configuration
  management system.
- AWS region must match the availability zones that you enter as CloudTruth parameters.
- CloudTruth Run allows injection of environment variables into Terraform commands.
- Create a CloudTruth API Access token and install the CLI.
- The CloudTruth explorer provides you a simple way of verifying the health and content
  of all your integrations in one place.
- CloudTruth allows you to manage secrets like API keys, database passwords, and tokens.
- organization is the organization ID for the installing org.
- type can only be slack, until we implement a different event handler.
- This page is mainly used to compare values between environments.
- Setup of connected app in api
- A project should represent the component you are trying to configure.
- Using a project hierarchy as a means to group similar components together.
- Service accounts are treated the same as user accounts without the ability to log
  in interactively.
- Without _cloudtruth_test_* allowed the integration status will show errors.
- 'Secrets Manager Details: Unable to complete a Secrets Manager operation. Please
  check your IAM policy for the ''secretsmanager:DescribeSecret'' permission.'
- 'SSM Details: Unable to complete an SSM operation. Please check your IAM policy
  for the ''ssm:GetParameter'' permission.'
- Buckets in us-east-1 must use a us-east-1 location selection
- Deleted parameters that contained null values are not displayed in historical comparisons.
- They do not display Created At or Modified At Times.
- Internal values can be converted between plain text values and dynamic values.
- Standard parameters are typically used for configuration values.
- Secret parameters are typically passwords, private certificates, or any other sensitive
  information.
- Only non-secret parameters can contain Dynamic Values; however, they can reference
  parameters marked as secrets.
- Each integration has a mapped import action you can trigger from there to refresh
  all of the mapped external values for that integration.
- Parameter override allows child projects to block inheritance from parent projects.
- Environment Value Override allows customization of individual environment values.
- Rules are set on the parameter itself within a selected project that provide validation
  of values across all of the parameters environments.
- CloudTruth will check across all environments to make sure the existing values conform
  to the new rule(s).
- Requires a CloudTruth API Access Token for authentication.
- Only organization Owners and Admins can invite additional users.
- It is recommended to have at least two users assigned the Owner role.
- Access Controls do not cascade through the project dependencies, therefore you will
  need to be precise with each project's access levels to ensure users can see all
  the projects in the dependency chain.
- You will be taken to the CloudTruth application where you will create an Organization.
  This is your own private space for creating and managing configurations.
