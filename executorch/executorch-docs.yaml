notes:
- ExecuTorch defines a streamlined workflow to prepare (export, transformation, and
  compilation) and execute a PyTorch program.
- ExecuTorch runtime is written in C++ with minimal dependencies for portability and
  execution efficiency.
- Tested on Linux (CentOS 8+, Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS+, RHEL 8+), macOS (Big Sur (11.0)+),
  and Windows (WSL).
- Requires `conda` or another virtual environment manager.
- When fetching a new version of the upstream repo (via git fetch or git pull) it
  is a good idea to clean the old build artifacts.
- The build system does not currently adapt well to changes in build dependencies.
- ExecuTorch uses CMake as its primary build system.
- This must be linked into your application with a flag like -Wl,-force_load or -Wl,--whole-archive.
- Uses CMake as its primary build system.
- To optimize the release build for size, use CMAKE_FLAGS="$CMAKE_FLAGS -DOPTIMIZE_SIZE=ON".
- ExecuTorch provides granular control over memory management and execution.
- The Module APIs provide a simplified interface for running ExecuTorch models in
  C++.
- For optimal performance, always link against the Release version of the deliverables.
- To access logs, link against the Debug build of the ExecuTorch runtime, i.e., the
  `executorch_debug` framework. For optimal performance, always link against the Release
  version of the deliverables.
- 'Uses MobileNet v3 model to process live camera images leveraging three different
  backends: XNNPACK, Core ML, and MPS.'
- This demo app and tutorial has only been validated with arm64-v8a ABI.
- The backend delegate is usually either provided by ExecuTorch or vendors.
- Backend delegation is an entry point for backends to process and execute PyTorch
  programs.
- The resultant model will only be partially delegated to the Vulkan backend.
- Operator support for LLaMA models is currently in active development.
- ExecuTorch backend delegate is under active development.
- Ensure you're on a supported platform with x86_64 or aarch64 architecture.
- This ExecuTorch backend delegate is under active development.
- You may encounter some rough edges and features which may be documented or planned
  but not implemented.
- Ensure you have completed ExecuTorch cmake build setup
- You need to generate a new executor-runner binary for each model change
- Core ML delegate uses Core ML APIs to enable running neural networks via Apple’s
  hardware acceleration.
- A mac system for building is required.
- macOS >= 13.0, iOS >= 16.0, iPadOS >= 16.0, and tvOS >= 16.0 are required for running
  the model.
- Core ML backend uses coremltools to lower Edge dialect to Core ML format.
- Requires macOS 12 or later for tracing and macOS 12.4 or later for runtime.
- Xcode version must be 14.1 or later.
- Requires macOS 12 or later for tracing models
- Requires iOS 15.4 or later for runtime
- The Linux host operating system that QNN Backend is verified with is Ubuntu 22.04
  LTS x64.
- This example is verified with SM8550 and SM8450.
- Qualcomm AI Engine Direct is also referred to as QNN in the source and documentation.
- Currently, this ExecuTorch Backend can delegate AI computations to Hexagon processors
  through Qualcomm AI Engine Direct APIs.
- Qualcomm AI Engine Direct is designed to provide unified, low-level APIs for AI
  development.
- The Linux host operating system that QNN Backend is verified with is Ubuntu 22.04
  LTS x64
- make sure you have write-permission on below path.
- The <device_serial> can be found by adb devices command.
- The linux part of this tutorial has been designed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS,
  and requires glibc 2.34.
- Before proceeding forward to the next section users should be able to successfully
  flash the dsp_mu_polling_cm33 sample application.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ExecuTorch enables on-device inference capabilities across mobile and edge devices.
- Backend dialect is an optional stage, only needed if we want to introduce backend-awareness
  into the graph.
- This dialect allows the introduction of operators that do not conform to the schema
  defined in the canonical ATen operator set.
- Uses an interpreter-based approach for executing nodes and recreating graphs
- Quantization is useful for edge devices including wearables, embedded devices and
  microcontrollers.
- ExecuTorch only supports out-style operators, where the caller provides the output
  Tensor or Tensor list in the final position with the name 'out'.
- ExecuTorch supports custom kernels for optimized performance.
- ExecuTorch users are asked to provide a custom kernel library with C++ implementations
  and a YAML file associated with the library.
- During the development phase, it’s recommended to use the C++ API since it’s low-cost
  to use and flexible to change.
- Once the application moves to the production phase, it is recommended to use the
  Yaml entry API.
- Selective build can reduce the binary size of the ExecuTorch runtime without compromising
  support for a target model.
- The Vulkan delegate is currently under active development, and its components are
  subject to change.
- BundledProgram is not necessarily a core part of the program and not needed for
  its execution.
- All method names in bundled config should be found in program.execution_plan
- Users should do a deepcopy of the output of to_edge() and pass in the deepcopy to
  the generate_etrecord API.
- Users can’t parse ETDump directly; instead, they should pass it into the Inspector
  API.
- After the inference iterations, users can dump out the ETDump buffer.
- ExecuTorch supports the extraction of model level outputs via ETDump.
- 'Currently supports two levels of debugging: Program level outputs and Intermediate
  outputs.'
- User should add this code after they call to_executorch(), and it will write memory
  allocation information stored on the nodes to the file path 'memory_profile.json'.
  The file is compatible with the Chrome trace viewer.
- Delegate backends are a prominent component of on-device models due to their flexibility
  in defining behavior.
