auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.messageflow.com/authentication:
  - 'API requests require two API keys sent as headers: Authorization header with
    the API key token, and Application-Key header with the application key token.
    Both are required for authentication.'
  - The API uses two required headers for authentication. Send the `Authorization`
    header with your authorization key (128-character string) and the `Application-Key`
    header with your app key. Both keys are generated in your account panel. Authentication
    failures return HTTP 401 with an error response.

  - 'API Key authentication is required using two separate API keys sent in request
    headers: APIKeyHeader and APPKeyHeader. Both keys must be provided to access the
    endpoint.'
- information_source; https://dev.messageflow.com/long-running-actions-retry-after-header-explained:
  - 'API Key authentication is required using two headers. Include `Authorization`
    header with an API key token (example: `Authorization: 123`) and `Application-Key`
    header with an application key token (example: `Application-Key: 123`). Both tokens
    must be provided in request headers when making API calls to the MessageFlow API.'
  - The webhook endpoint requires authorization checking. The authorization method
    is configured in the panel settings under Account -> Settings -> Webhooks, and
    your endpoint must validate authorization according to that configuration before
    processing the request. The specific authorization scheme (API key, token, signature,
    etc.) is determined by your panel settings but is not detailed in this documentation
    excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.messageflow.com/authentication:
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination for GET methods with two query parameters:
    limit controls the number of returned elements and offset omits elements from
    the beginning. Additionally, the API supports long-running tasks via HTTP 202
    ACCEPTED responses with Retry-After header indicating seconds to wait before retrying,
    and Expires header indicating when the response becomes stale.'
- information_source; https://dev.messageflow.com/long-running-actions-retry-after-header-explained:
  - The API supports offset-based pagination using query parameters limit (to restrict
    number of returned elements) and offset (to skip elements from the beginning).
    Additionally, long-running actions may return HTTP 202 ACCEPTED with a Retry-After
    header indicating seconds to wait before retrying, and an Expires header indicating
    when the response becomes stale.
