notes:
- For managing static translations in your repository, consider using the Tolgee CLI.
- Super JWT token is required for sensitive operations when user has set 2FA.
- It's not recommended to use API key in query param, since it can be stored in logs.
- Tolgee can be self-hosted as it is open source.
- Uses JWT for authentication
- We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for
  undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration.
- We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to
  a written contract between us and each service provider.
- 'Tolgee works in two modes: development and production.'
- When both apiKey and apiUrl properties are provided, Tolgee runs in development
  mode, otherwise it runs in production mode.
- Never include apiKey in Tolgee configuration on production.
- Tolgee offers unique technology for in-context translating, it combines simplicity
  of regular i18n libraries with comfort of in-context translating directly in your
  app.
- Never include apiKey in Tolgee configuration on production. This property is intended
  only for local development, as it's not meant to be publicly visible.
- In-context on production should be always behind some authentication or in a private
  network. Make sure you are not exposing your credentials publicly.
- This is documentation for Tolgee 5.x.x, which is no longer actively maintained.
- For larger projects, it might be beneficial to keep track which keys are newly created
  and which are already used on production.
- Text observer is part of ObserverPlugin, which is included in DevTools.
- Make sure you don't leak your API key. If the API key is leaked, visitors can edit
  the translations on your site.
- In production mode, you should never use localization data directly from Tolgee
  REST API, because it can negatively affect your page performance.
- Make sure you don't include `TOLGEE_API_KEY` in production build.
- Currently, non-closing tags and self-closing tags are not supported
- API key format was changed in version 2.38.0. Now all API keys have the tgpak_ prefix.
- To access REST API endpoints with a Project API key, you can provide the API key
  via the X-API-Key header or via the ak query param.
- Content delivery is made to be rapidly available all around the world, so we prioritize
  caching and using CDN over fast deployment. This means it can take up to 15 minutes
  (usually faster) for your changes to be published.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Never include `apiKey` in Tolgee configuration on production.
- You can provide local data as a fallback for CDN, for cases when a network request
  fails.
- Order of plugins is important here, they are used in the same order as they were
  added.
- Emitted events can be listened through tolgee.on method.
- By default Tolgee encodes only key indexes and that requires the usage of the same
  instance for wrapping and unwrapping.
- Labels are available in the Business and Enterprise plans.
- Follow the installation guide to add the Tolgee React SDK to your existing React
  application.
- Obtaining Tolgee API key is described in Integration chapter.
- API key required for Tolgee project.
- Ensure to store credentials securely in .env.development.local file.
- cache CDN data for one minute
- Tolgee sanitizes HTML tags in translations.
- Requires setup of connected app in Tolgee
