  - Bearer token authentication is required. Add the Authorization header with value
    "Bearer <<Token>>" where <<Token>> is a temporary developer token obtained from
    your Box Application's Configuration settings. Developer tokens expire after 60
    minutes. For production use, an Authenticated API Datasource should be established
    to handle token refresh automatically.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.appsmith.com/blog/graphql-is-now-available-in-appsmith:
  - Appsmith's GraphQL support includes pagination by limit and offset or by keysets,
    also called cursor-based pagination. The documentation mentions these as pagination
    methods but does not provide specific parameter names, request/response field
    details, or navigation rules.
  - Cursor-based pagination is supported with before and after parameters passed to
    the query. The response includes pageInfo with endCursor, hasNextPage, hasPreviousPage,
    and startCursor fields to navigate between pages.
