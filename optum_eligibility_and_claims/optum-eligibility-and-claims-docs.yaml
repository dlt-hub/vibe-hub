notes:
- Most of our APIs are private and require credentials to gain access.
- The Enhanced Eligibility API extends the functionality of Optum’s 270/271 json-based
  Eligibility API.
- Optum uses OAuth2 to create a secure connection with our API users, which requires
  a bearer authorization token.
- Sandbox is not available for this API. Information is only returned by the API when
  it is added in the online PES workflow. If no enrollments are added in the workflow,
  then no data will be returned in the API call.
- Access token is valid for one hour from the time of issuance.
- Sandbox is not available for this API. Information is only returned by the API when
  it is added in the online PES workflow.
- Access token is valid for one hour from issuance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The API supports the X12 EDI 275 Patient Information transaction.
- The Attachments Submissions v1 API allows clients to submit claim attachments and
  query their status.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Bearer token lifespan is limited.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'HTTPS: Optum APIs are only accessible through HTTPS'
- 'JSON: Request and response contents are in JSON format'
- 'OAuth: All Optum API requests are protected by OAuth2 Bearer token to obtain access'
- The lifespan of a bearer token is one hour (3600 seconds) for both sandbox and production
  environments.
- Optum strongly recommends you carefully guard your API access credentials. Avoid
  sharing them with others.

  environments.
- Optum APIs are only accessible through HTTPS
- Request and response contents are in JSON format
- All Optum API requests are protected by OAuth2 Bearer token to obtain access
- Optum strongly recommends you carefully guard your API access credentials.
- 'When you are ready to move from sandbox to production, replace the sandbox authorization
  URL with the production URL: https://apigw.optum.com/apip/auth/v2/token'
- Bearer token lifespan is one hour (3600 seconds) for both sandbox and production

- Do not perform load testing or production data testing in the sandbox environment.
- Medical Network APIs v1, v2, and v3 (as of 09-02-2021) are deployed to an enhanced
  cloud-native network connection, which offers improved API speed and reliability.
  We recommend updating your systems to the following API endpoint URLs at the first
  opportunity.
- Do not use the https://apis.changehealthcare.com as it is an old domain and no longer
  supported.
- The JSON attributes in our APIs use snake-case, with the first letter of the attribute
  in lower case as in propertyCasualtyClaimNumber. Our APIs are case-sensitive and
  your JSON request body must observe this convention.
- For sandbox usage, all fields must have the correct predefined values to obtain
  a successful response. Inventing new PMI values or using real-world PMI values will
  result in errors.

  connection, which offers improved API speed and reliability.
- For sandbox usage, all fields must have the correct predefined values to obtain
  a successful response.
- DO NOT perform load testing or production data testing in the sandbox environment.
  Please use the sandbox ONLY to view sample API responses.
- Avoid using real-world values in our sandbox API endpoints! Doing so will produce
  errors.
- Use the sandbox ONLY to view sample API responses.
- The TESTEP10 Test PayerId is designed for the 'Partially Accepted' use case. Use
  at least two attachments in the same sandbox API request to receive an accurate
  response for this use case.
- Ensure all documents conform to file format standards and also avoid sending files
  that exceed more than a few megabytes each.
- Payers may reject an attachment due to excessive file sizes.
- Use the Try It Interface to test API calls
- The TESTEP10 Test PayerId is designed for the 'Partially Accepted' use case.
- Attachments may fail to fax; you will receive a notification for each attempt until
  it goes through.
- API & Services Connection™
- Select Attachments features are not yet supported by the sandbox standard responses.
- Enter your Bearer token in the Authorization box exactly as shown in the example.
- API users need not enable this capability; it is automatic and has no effect on
  information in any medical transaction.
- Upon request, give this entire object to Optum support for troubleshooting.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format, as in 2021-03-31.
- The 'submitterId' field is required; it prevents users from searching for medical
  information to which they do not have legal access.
- Do not use the `traceId` value as a metadata search criteria.
- Pagination works with the query parameters size and page. Its maximum size is 1000.
  Page numbering starts at page 0.
- Check the headers for any typos or unexpected values.
- Validate your JSON to make sure it is properly formatted.
- Try the healthcheck endpoint to make sure the API is up and running.
- The submitter gets unsolicited claim status about the claim being in process.
- All metadata queries must have submitterId, transactionReceivedStartDate, and transactionReceivedEndDate.
- Do not use the traceId value as a metadata search criteria.
- Use OAuth2 for authentication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in optum
- If a claim is rejected by the payer, make the requested changes and generate a new
  submission with a new patientControlNumber.
- If a claim is denied by the payer, a corrected claim would be required.
- The Attachments Submission API provides useful error information with HTTP 400 code
  when the request body contains mistakes or when something else in the process goes
  wrong.
- Unable to Process the Request at this Time
- Eligibility API is giving `unable to process the request at this time, please try
  again later`.
- 406 Error when running Auth Token Example
- 'While calling the API, the following DNS error occurs: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:
  No subject alternative DNS name matching sandbox-apigw.optum.com found'
- The Patient Account Number must not be greater than 20 characters and must only
  contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and !"&'()+,-./;?=%@[]{}#$
- The auth API gives Either `client_id` or `client_secret` are invalid, when using
  correct value for both. It works via curl.
- Test sandbox by using our OpenAPI specs from the API Reference Overview section.
- Ensure to use the allowed sandbox predefined fields and values while testing our
  APIs.
- Invalid Access Token Error in Sandbox
- Access token might not be valid for the selected API or you might have selected
  one API to test but tried a different API.
- You might have used your own data instead of the predefined values and fields.
- You might not have followed the OpenAPI specs.
- An NPI error when running the Eligibility API endpoint
- Consult your Optum representative to determine which formats your payers can work
  with.
- Testing claims in the sandbox is limited to predefined data values.
- 'If you are unable to login to the application, please reach out to ConnectCenter
  MFA Support: 800-527-8133 opt., ''7'' or connectcenter_mfasupport@optum.com.'
- API requires setup of connected app in api
- If you only plan to use a few daily transactions, you can use npd or cap for your
  Medical Network transaction needs.
- For providers sending hundreds of daily requests, we recommend using our APIs to
  be able to automate the submission processes.
- We do not have an API to check provider directories to see if they are a part of
  a network.
- We do not offer webhooks for this information.
- Try the `healthcheck` endpoint to make sure the API is up and running.
- 'Some information in the Eligibility requests is Situational: you can include or
  omit specific information depending on the individual encounter.'
- Many encounters involve only a policy subscriber, so the request can omit dependent
  information.
- Version 2 is fully compliant with the expectations outlined in the OAuth 2.0 specification.
- Customers should only use the payerlists for the products/services they are contracted
  to, or testing with.
- Before using the Eligibility `/raw-X12` endpoint, contact your Optum implementation
  analyst. Our Raw-X12 service requires custom headers with credentials, and other
  information specific to each customer's contracted PayerList relationships that
  you will need to obtain from your analyst contact.
- See 270/271 Implementation Guide for further details.
- While we make every effort to keep all information up to date and accurate, Optum
  makes no warranties, express or implied, about completeness, accuracy, reliability,
  or availability regarding the content, images, services or hyperlinks in our documentation.
- It is a good practice to build shorter API requests that limit the amount of work
  needed to obtain successful and accurate Eligibility queries.
- If you submit an Eligibility request with a serviceTypeCode other than 30 to a payer
  that does not support other more-specific code values for this information, you
  will receive a generic response equaling the standard one of 30.
- The header attributes (controlNumber, reassociationKey, tradingPartnerServiceId,
  and submitterTransactionIdentifier) are required for all Eligibility API transactions.
- API requires setup of connected app in optum
- All requests must have the Authorization header.
- Use our OpenAPI Spec JSON file as a reference for development.
- To obtain a license that also provides access to the full requirements for these
  transactions, visit https://x12.org/licensing.
- See Page 92-93 of the 270/271 Implementation Guide for further detail.
- Supports only SSH-FTP for SFTP submissions.
- The file suffix must be *.275
- Ensure that the file is named properly before you upload
- 'Do not use the following characters in any file name: ‘ “ ( ) [ ] { } / , $ @ &
  = + * # ! % ` | ? < > ; or spaces'

  is your responsibility.
- Security and Authorization V2
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Optum
- Some payers may return shorter responses
- The Eligibility API uses a POST request with JSON in the body.
- Responses may contain lengthy information.
- The response will contain information directly from the payer.
- Co-payment details may vary between payers or plans.
- Eligibility API is giving 'unable to process the request at this time, please try
  again later'? The auth API gives Either **client_id** or **client_secret** are invalid,
  when using correct value for both. It works via curl though.
- If you only plan to use a few daily transactions, you can use ConnectCenter for
  your Medical Network transaction needs.
- If you are submitting the request to Medicare, they would return additional information
  related to specific insuranceTypes.
- The JSON attributes in our APIs use snake-case, with the first letter of the attribute
  in lower case as in `claimInformation`.
- 'Using value: test00005 (lower case) for fieldName: patientControlNumber returns
  EDITS canned response.'
- API users need not enable metadata capability; it is automatic and has no effect
  on information in any medical transaction.
- Service type code is used to identify business groupings for healthcare services
  and benefits.
- If you submit an Eligibility request with a serviceTypeCode other than '30' to a
  payer that does not support other more-specific code values for this information,
  you will receive a generic response equaling the standard one of '30', describing
  whether or not the patient has active coverage.
- Check the Eligibility API Mappings document in the Attachments tab for a complete
  Eligibility EDI loop and segment mappings to the JSON fields in the Eligibility
  270 requests and 271 responses.
- Eligibility API is giving "unable to process the request at this time, please try
  again later"
- 'Error, ''Please use predefined canned users for non-prod environments: lastName
  was not predefined'' while submitting Eligibility API request'
- Requires setup of connected app in optum
- For more sophisticated checking of Professional claims, consider contracting for
  Professional Claims Integrated Rules API.
- Uses claimFrequencyCode '1' for original submissions.
- Uses claimFrequencyCode '7' for denied claims and corrections.
- Uses claimFrequencyCode '8' for voided claims.
- 'In the Professional and Institutional Claims sandbox request, using value: test00005
  (lower case and not uppercase), for fieldName: patientControlNumber returns EDITS
  canned response.'
- Responses can be lengthy due to many data points provided in the query response.
- The first response indicates acceptance of the claim, not payment.
- Uses claimFrequencyCode '1' for original submissions and '7' for denied claims.
- API users need not enable metadata capability; it is automatic.
- The first response from the clearinghouse indicates acceptance, not payment.
- Test Production Data without Submitting for Processing
- Sending a claim with the usageIndicator is a valid way to test production data without
  submitting for processing.
- A key block of medical coding information that defines the actual procedures and
  services rendered for the medical encounter.
- The /validation endpoint does not send your transaction to the payer.
- The /validation and /submission endpoints use the same request model.
- Invoking the submission API shows "invalid_request" as response.
- The `/validation` endpoint does not send your transaction to the payer.
- The `/submission` endpoint would be the primary method of test claim data.
- The payer name will populate as unknown unless the `tradingPartnerName` is sent
  along with the specific `tradingPartnerServiceId`.
- A single Institutional Claim supports up to 999 service line items.
- The first response does not indicate whether the claim is being paid; it indicates
  that the clearinghouse has accepted the claim.
- Segment is situational, all fields are required if the object is in use for the
  claim.
- Use the OpenAPI Spec JSON file as a reference for development.
- Elements marked with 'R' in the C/R column are required when the subscriber is the
  patient.
- Multiple claims need to be submitted for multiple authorization numbers.
- Responses can be lengthy due to many data points.
- APIs translate between JSON and X12 EDI.
- First response indicates acceptance of the claim by the clearinghouse, not payment
  status.
- A correct claim is only submitted when the payer has actually adjudicated the submission
  and processed the claim for payment.
- '`claimFrequencyCode` ''1'' is used for all original submissions even if a claim
  has been rejected.'
- '`claimFrequencyCode` ''7'' is used specifically if a payer denies a claim and corrections
  need to be made.'
- If a claim submission response is received with status **EDIT**, use `claimFrequencyCode`
  '7', that is, if a claim is denied at the payer and a '0' dollar or incomplete payment
  is received.
- If a claim is denied or partially paid by a payer, a corrected claim should be sent
  for additional review.
- Submitting a corrected claim would require the claim frequency code '7', and the
  payer claim `controlNumber` must be included on the claim in the `claimControlNumber`
  field in the `claimSupplementalInformation`.
- The `claimControlNumber` is the number assigned by the payer to identify a claim.
- The same process would need to be followed for voided claims, but using a frequency
  code '8'.
- We recommend using the Validation API before sending the claim request to the payer.
- Handle multiple authorization numbers per claim
- Both JSON and EDI endpoints use the same API request model with the same sets of
  attributes.
- The Institutional Claims v1 API does not directly support X12 EDI submissions.
- In the sandbox environment, you can test claims only by using sandbox predefined
  fields and values.
- Test Claims in Sandbox
- Please make sure that the API you are trying to test is added to your sandbox entitlement/credentials.
- Within the sandbox environment, you can only test with sandbox API values and test
  responses.
- With claims, you can do more thorough testing with live data being sent to the production
  endpoint, but be sure to specify the usage indicator to 'T'.
- It checks for the correct well-formed syntax of your submission.
- The /submission endpoint would be the primary method of test claim data.
- The payer name will populate as unknown unless the tradingPartnerName is sent along
  with the specific trandingPartnerServiceId.
- If the patient is the subscriber, only the subscriber details would be present in
  the transactions.
- Validation does not examine the actual contents of your claim.
- The first response indicates that the clearinghouse has accepted the claim, not
  whether it is being paid.
- Institutional Claims API JSON-to-EDI Contents
- Our APIs translate back and forth between JSON and X12 EDI when the information
  departs into and returns from the medical network.
- Most Medicare have the Eligibility ID/Realtime ID of CMSMED.
- If there are specifics that do not, such as, a Medicare Advantage plan, might require
  separate enrollment.
- Most Claim Status 277 responses will contain a header with several attributes.
- You can look up the entire `statusCategoryCode` table and its associated `statusCategoryCodeValue`
  table in the X12 EDI standards page.
- You can use the /institutionalclaims/v1/healthcheck endpoint to check the operating
  status of the service endpoint before sending the claim.
- Create an EDI 837p 5010 Claim for a Client-Primary and Secondary Insurances
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Corrected claims require the claim frequency code '7', and the payer claim controlNumber
  must be included in the claimSupplementalInformation.
- Payers require time to process the claims before the Claim Status may be available.
- When your EDI formatted request is corrected and validated, use your normal claim
  submission workflow to submit the claim.
- Best practice would be to ensure tracking numbers are the same so any claim status
  requests can immediately be linked back to the original submission.
- In the sandbox environment, you can test claims only by using our sandbox predefined
  fields and values.
- Use STC Codes
- Refer to the API documentation for specific configurations.
- Raw-X12 service requires custom headers with credentials, and other information
  specific to each customer's contracted Payer List relationships.
- Attachments Retrieval JSON-to-EDI API Contents
- The OpenAPI Spec file for this API lists out the complete contents of the Attachment
  Submission request body.
- Attachments Retrieval API requires authentication
- Our APIs translate back and forth between JSON and X12 EDI.
- Claim Status API JSON-to-EDI Contents
- You can look up the entire statusCategoryCode table and its associated statusCategoryCodeValue
  table in the X12 EDI standards page.
- The `claimstatus/v2/raw-x12/enhanced` endpoint provides additional information above
  the `claimstatus/v2/` endpoint response information currently available to submitters.
- API requires authentication for access
- Response contains detailed claim status information
- Best practice would be to ensure trackingNumber is the same for linking requests.
- If you only plan to use a few daily transactions, you can use our ConnectCenter
  for your Medical Network transaction needs.
- For providers sending hundreds of daily requests, we recommend using our APIs to
  be able to automate the submission processes and have a better fit for your business
  needs.

- For Unsolicited Attachments transactions, each attachment must have a unique providerAttachmentControlNumber
  value.
- For Solicited Attachments transactions, use the payerClaimControlNumber in the JSON
  request body.
- The traceId is a 128-bit UUID generated and sent by the clearinghouse for each attachment
  transaction.
- The acknowledgement appends the tradingPartnerServiceId, which is required to request
  benefit information from an insurance carrier.
- Payer Submissions with unsupported 275 Transactions and that do not accept Faxes
- To send attachments to Worker's Compensation agencies, you must enroll beforehand.
- For Unsolicited attachments, consider workman's compensation claims.

  attachments submission record.
- Uses OAuth2 authentication
- The customer's back office developers should maintain the`traceId` value for every
  attachments submission record.

- Your Callback API endpoint must also be whitelisted.
- Callback API must be whitelisted by Optum.
- The expires_in field is critical — we use it to determine when to reissue the token.
- Customers must implement a Callback API that supports OAuth2 authentication.
- This value is controlled by the Enhanced Eligibility Team.
- 'Ensure your API returns appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 OK for successful token
  generation, 204 No Content for valid callback responses, 401 Unauthorized for invalid
  credentials or missing tokens, 403 Forbidden if the token is present but lacks sufficient
  permissions.'
