auth_info:
- information_source; https://connect.withsecure.com/getting-started/elements:
  - A client must authenticate using OAuth2 bearer token credentials provided in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>". The access token is obtained
    through Elements API client credentials (created at either organization or partner
    level), and the client can only retrieve security events for organizations within
    the scope of those credentials.
  - Bearer token authentication is required in the Authorization header. Send the
    token as "Bearer ${token}" in the Authorization header for GET requests to the
    API.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>".
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access_token>".
  - Elements API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication. Clients must
    authenticate by sending a POST request to /as/token.oauth2 with Base64-encoded
    credentials in the Authorization header using "Basic" scheme, form data containing
    grant_type set to "client_credentials", and a scope parameter (either "connect.api.read"
    for read-only or "connect.api.write" for write operations). A User-Agent header
    is required on all requests or they will be rejected.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://connect.withsecure.com/getting-started/elements:
  - Collections are paginated with up to 200 items per page. Use the `nextAnchor`
    value from the response as the `anchor` query parameter in the next request to
    iterate through pages. The `limit` query parameter controls page size. Stop paginating
    when `nextAnchor` is not returned or is null.
  - Pagination uses query parameters anchor (cursor for next page) and limit (page
    size, default/max 10). Use the anchor value from the response to request the next
    page; stop when no anchor is returned.
- information_source; https://connect.withsecure.com/getting-started/elements-cookbook:
  - Pagination uses a limit parameter (set to 50 in the example) as a query parameter
    to control page size, and a next_page parameter to retrieve subsequent pages.
    Stop paginating when no next_page value is returned in the response.
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter to specify maximum items per response
    (default appears to be configurable, example shows 10). The response includes
    an items array and a nextAnchor property; if nextAnchor is present, include it
    as a parameter in the next request to fetch the next page. Stop paginating when
    nextAnchor is absent from the response.
  - 'Use query parameters for pagination: `limit` (default 200) controls page size,
    `persistenceTimestampStart` specifies the timestamp threshold, and `exclusiveStart`
    (boolean, must be `true` to avoid duplicates) determines whether results are strictly
    greater than or greater-than-or-equal-to the timestamp. Use the `next_page` token
    from the response to fetch subsequent pages.'
