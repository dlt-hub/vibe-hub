- information_source; https://support.paazl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007607413-Authentication-and-authorization:
  - Paazl uses three-legged OAuth 2.0 authentication. You must generate a public API
    Key and private API Secret from the REST API configuration screen in the Paazl
    web app, then use these credentials to request an access token from the Paazl
    authentication server. The API Secret must be kept private and known only to your
    webshop, while customers can only access the API Key.

  - 'Paazl uses OAuth 2.0 three-legged authentication with API Key (public) and API
    Secret (private). The Authorization header accepts Bearer tokens in two formats:
    API Key alone for certain endpoints (checkout, shippingoptions, pickuplocations)
    as "Bearer {api_key}", or API Key and Secret combined for others (token, checkout
    GET, order operations) as "Bearer {api_key}:{api_secret}". URL whitelisting is
    recommended for additional authorization control.'

  - Paazl uses three-legged OAuth 2.0 authentication requiring an access token to
    secure REST API requests. Refer to the Authentication & Authorization documentation
    for details on how to obtain and use the access token.
  - Paazl uses three-legged OAuth 2.0 authentication. The authentication server URL
    is https://api.paazl.com/v1/. You need to whitelist the IP address of Paazl's
    authentication server for the checkout/token endpoint. A Paazl license is required,
    and your webshop must be able to send REST API requests and receive responses.
- information_source; https://support.paazl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008633973-REST-API-reference:
  - Bearer token authentication is required in the Authorization header. Some endpoints
    require only an API key in the format "Bearer api_key", while others require both
    API key and secret in the format "Bearer api_key:api_secret". POST shippingOptions,
    POST pickupLocations, and POST checkout use "Bearer api_key". POST token, GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
    checkout and order endpoints, POST/GET shipments use "Bearer api_key:api_secret".
