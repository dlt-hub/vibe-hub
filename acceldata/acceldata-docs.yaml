notes:
- The secret key is only shown once, store it securely.
- Ensure the Alation user has REST API access permissions.
- Generate a Client ID and Secret under your Alation Service Account. Enable read
  access to the catalog and lineage scopes.
- Ensure your user account has the necessary Tenant Role permissions.
- Kubernetes versions 1.25 through 1.27 are supported for Data Plane deployment.
- Alerts are automatically generated whenever a monitoring rule or policy condition
  is breached.
- Admins can add users to the platform by sending them an invitation email.
- Users can be in multiple groups.
- Roles and Permissions provide fine-grained access control to ensure each user or
  group can only perform actions necessary for their responsibilities.
- Proper role design is essential for minimizing security risks and ensuring smooth
  workflows.
- SSO is managed through authentication providers like Okta or Azure AD.
- You must have administrative access within your IdP.
