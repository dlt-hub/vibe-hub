- Each Support Account has a limited lifetime and must be recreated after expiration.
- Application Lifecycle and Management Companion to Microsoft Intune
- Your permissions level will determine what is visible within the navigation bar.
- Initial deployment needs direct Internet access. No proxy would be ideal.
- For mass rollouts, BranchCache Servers with pre-populated caches are recommended.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- This page gives you an overview about your organization (Azure Tenant), incl. number
  of users and groups.
- Search always uses a starts-with approach rather than a full-text or 'contains'
  search.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in RealmJoin
- Requires setup of connected app in RealmJoin
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires setup of connected app in RealmJoin Portal
- Currently, only Delete is available.
- If you are allowed to delete the group, a confirmation dialogue will pop up upon
  pressing the Delete button.
- The default Overview tab view will include information like the currently logged
  on user and security recommendations.
- We rely on the information provided by the vendors through their APIs. We do not
  guarantee the accuracy of this information.
- Depending on the API used, a captcha might be displayed before requesting/displaying
  warranty information.
- If you recently self-onboarded into RealmJoin or do not have a subscription/licensing
  agreement yet, the list of software packages will be limited to a free-to-use subset
  of packages.
- Managed packages are the preferred way to deploy software to your users.
- Users and devices should only be in one RealmJoin managed group at any given time.
- Different types of packages have different levels of support to be managed via RealmJoin
  Portal.
- All requests need a file attached to be created successfully.
- Organic packages, offered at no cost, automatically extract the contents of the
  provided zip file to the C:\Install directory.
- Intune Packages can not be assigned using AVD templates.
- Make sure to enter your individual template ID and token during headless deployment
- To check the status/logs during headless deployment, open and periodically refresh
  realmjoin.log
- RealmJoin Portal automates the creation, updating and removal of runbooks.
- RealmJoin will create an Application Registration called RealmJoin Runbook Management
  which is used to update the Azure Automation Runbooks in your tenant based on RealmJoin's
  shared runbook repository.
- RealmJoin will create an application in your Azure environment called 'RealmJoin
  Runbook Management'.
- RealmJoin provides administrators with the ability to automate tasks by using Azure
  Automation to execute PowerShell Runbooks.
- The customizations can be included in the runbook itself and/or stored in the customer's
  RealmJoin Portal instance.
- By default, we will try to offer sensible defaults in the runbooks offered on GitHub.
- Customizations can be included in the runbook itself and/or stored in the customer's
  RealmJoin Portal instance.
- Default values from the runbook can be overridden by customizations.
- Runbook Permissions define the visibility of runbooks for certain users.
- By default, not all runbooks are flagged as schedulable.
- Runbooks having the suffix '_scheduled' are flagged as schedulable.
- Azure Automation will only keep runbook job logs for a limited time.
- Azure Automation supports Managed Identities as the primary way to authenticate.
- If a Managed Identity and a RunAs Account are configured at the same time, the runbooks
  will prefer using the Managed Identity.
- Intune remediation scripts allow you to report and react to problems on managed
  Windows clients using scripts.
- Only one form of logging needs to be chosen - either Application Insights or Log
  Analytics.
- Logging is optional when setting up LAPS.
- Users may access accounts created on their own devices when enabled using the RealmJoin
  Portal starting with version 2022.5.1.
- Notifications can be set to not reappear once acknowledged by the user.
- Once everything has been set up, the tray icon can be used to get support without
  sharing the ID number or downloading executables by hand.
- RealmJoin integrates directly with your Microsoft Intune tenant by adding and updating
  the agent as an intunewin package.
- RealmJoin.MSI is SHA2 (256 bit) signed by RealmJoin and therefore recognized by
  Windows as safe to install.
- Windows Update for Business reports may take up to 24 hours to apply
- It can take several minutes for an action to be visible in the Audit Log.
- Custom Roles is an optional feature in RealmJoin Portal and allows to create additional
  RealmJoin internal roles.
- Users must activate their membership through PIM to gain access
- Admin access automatically expires after the defined duration
- The pre-filled group namespaces can be changed or additional namespaces can be added
  to suit company requirements.
- This feature requires a blob storage on Azure.
- If the setting 'Allow enabling anonymous access on individual containers' is not
  enabled during creation of the storage account, RealmJoin will display the error
  'Error uploading file. Please try again'.
- Self Service Forms is an optional feature that can be enabled for your tenant by
  RealmJoin Support.
- Integrate RealmJoin in your applications and workflows
- RealmJoin will not allow you to interact with resources foreign to your tenant.
- RealmJoin Portal requires SSL/TLS transport layer encryption on every request.
- Make sure to remove older Dev-Certificates using mmc.exe from your set of personal
  certificates if present to avoid conflicts/login failures.
- The CustomProtocol class defines a set of URI-like prefixes that can be used to
  trigger specific actions within the system by providing a package ID.
- Endpoints are secured via OAuth 2.0 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
- RealmJoin contains an internal application store compatible with Intunewin
- RealmJoin offers packaging-as-a-service to provide any missing applications
- This guide is only valid for software deployment using the RealmJoin client (not
  intunewin).
- 'Common issues faced with the RealmJoin LAPS solution are usually one of the following:'
- The subscription for RealmJoin is user-based.
- The minimum amount of users that can be subscribed for one organization is 1.000.
- RealmJoin is offered as a monthly or annual subscription plan with different User
  Segments.
- The annual plan is discounted by 10% in comparison to the monthly plan.
- You must have permissions in your Azure tenant to purchase through Azure Marketplace.
- The subscription belongs to an Enterprise Agreement (EA) and the EA admin disabled
  Azure Marketplace purchases.
- Support is included in the RealmJoin subscription fee.
- Support response time is typical < 4 hours for incidents.
- Packaging delivery time is typical < 5 business days.
- Third party applications can interact with RealmJoin via its API
