notes:
- No pagination
- The websites for Univention product documentation doesnâ€™t use Cookies.
- The UCS@school Kelvin REST API can be used out of the box, but there are various
  parameters that can be configured.
- The token will be valid for a configurable amount of time (default 60 minutes),
  after which it must be renewed.
- Only members of the group ucsschool-kelvin-rest-api-admins are allowed to access
  the API.
- Token is valid for a configurable amount of time (default 60 minutes)
- All operations will be executed using the cn=admin LDAP account
- The item list of the Roles resource is hard coded.
- Searching for roles (with ?name=abc* or similar) is not supported.
- Requests to resource endpoints must carry a valid token.
- Sending no or an invalid token leads to the server responding with HTTP status 401.
- The Schools resource currently supports listing and creating objects but does not
  support modifying or deleting OUs.
- UCS@school uses the UDM REST API to access LDAP.
- Schools resource only supports listing and creating objects. It does not support
  modifying or deleting OUs.
- The password attribute is missing in the response, because UCS systems never stores
  or sends clear text passwords.
- The Users resource is represented in the LDAP tree as user objects.
- The queried school has to exist, whilst the class to be created must not exist.
- Matching of the queried class and school is case-insensitive.
- The search for the school name is case sensitive and requires exact match.
- Matching of the queried workgroup and school is case-sensitive.
- The queried school has to exist, whilst the workgroup to be created must not exist.
- Whenever a new UDM module, extended option or extended attribute is installed, the
  OpenAPI client library used by the Python UDM REST API Client library must be rebuilt
  to be able to access the new module/attribute.
- It is thus necessary to rebuild the OpenAPI client manually.
- The Kelvin API can now be installed on servers with the role DC Primary and DC Backup.
- The Kelvin API now supports udm properties on all Kelvin resources except roles.
