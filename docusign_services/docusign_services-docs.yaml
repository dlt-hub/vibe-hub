  : - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
      the value "Authorization:Bearer" followed by your token in GET requests to access
      the API endpoints.

      authenticate, POST your client_id and client_secret (obtained when enabling
      the Salesforce org for Conga Composer API) to https://login-rls.co with grant_type
      set to client_credentials and Content-Type header set to application/json. The
      response returns an access_token that must be included in subsequent merge API
      requests.
