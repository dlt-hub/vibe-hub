  - 'API subscription required with username and password credentials. Authentication
    is performed via URL path parameters: the endpoint format is https://markerapi.com/api/v1/trademark/search/*term*/username/*user*/password/*pass*
    where *user* and *pass* are the username and password from your API subscription
    account.'
  - 'Basic authentication using username and password credentials passed as URL path
    segments. The API requires a username and password to be embedded in the request
    URL in the format: https://markerapi.com/api/v1/trademark/search/{search_term}/username/{username}/password/{password}.
    An active API subscription is required.'
  - Credentials are passed as URL path segments. The API requires a username and password
    to be included directly in the request URL at the path positions /username/{username}/password/{password}.
    Provide your API username and password as plain text in the URL path.
  - 'You must have an active API subscription. Authentication uses basic auth credentials
    passed as URL path parameters: username and password. Include your API username
    and password in the URL path as /username/*api username*/password/*api password*
    for each request to the Trademark Search API endpoint (and by extension, the other
    endpoints which follow the same URL structure).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://markerapi.com/:
  - All API endpoints implement paging with 100 results per page. When a response
    contains more results, the "next" key is set to an integer value that should be
    used as the "start" parameter in the subsequent API call with all other parameters
    unchanged to retrieve the next page.
  - Pagination uses a start path parameter (integer, starting at 1 for new searches).
    The response includes a count field indicating results returned. To get the next
    page, increment start by the number of results received and make another request
    with the new start value.

  - All API endpoints implement paging with 100 results per page. When a response
    contains more results, the "next" key is set to an integer value that should be
    used as the "start" query parameter in the next API call to retrieve the subsequent
    page, while keeping all other parameters unchanged.
