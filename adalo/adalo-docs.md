In this guide, we'll set up a complete Adalo data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def adalo_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.adalo.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "products",
            "purchases",
            "notifications"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='adalo_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='adalo_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(adalo_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from adalo‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Products: Endpoint to retrieve product listings.
- Purchases: Endpoint to handle purchase transactions.
- Notifications: Endpoint to send notifications to users.
- Records Management: Endpoints for CRUD operations on database records.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Adalo workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@adalo-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Adalo support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:adalo duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@adalo-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Adalo API, as specified in @adalo-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "products" and "purchases" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in adalo_pipeline.py and name the pipeline adalo_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python adalo_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is implemented using an API key placed within the request header under 'Authorization'.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.adalo.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python adalo_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline adalo load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset adalo_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/adalo.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline adalo_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("adalo_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "products" table as Pandas frame
   data."products".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Due to app store guidelines, features like 'Sign In with Apple' are mandatory for app approval. Make sure your Adalo plan supports API integration. Monitor your App Actions Dashboard usage to avoid reaching limits. Collection Permissions must be correctly set to access the app's Database. Be aware of the rate limit of 5 requests per second to avoid a 429 status code.
