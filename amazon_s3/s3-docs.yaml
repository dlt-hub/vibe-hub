# Known Quirks or Risks, Caveats
notes:
  - Requires IAM policy with `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` permissions
  - Object-level permissions alone are not sufficient; bucket-level permissions are also needed

# Troubleshooting & Error Patterns
errors:
  - NoSuchBucket: Ensure the bucket name is correct and exists
  - AccessDenied: Check IAM permissions and policies for the user or role
