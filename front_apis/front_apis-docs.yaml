auth_info:

  - 'The Core API uses Bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header.
    Tokens can be obtained either through API tokens generated in settings or via
    OAuth implementation. For each request, include the Authorization header with
    the format "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]".'
- information_source; https://dev.frontapp.com/docs/creating-a-partner-channel:
  - Front uses bearer token authentication in the OAuth flow for channel identification.
    During authorization, Front POSTs to your webhook URL with a bearer token in the
    request header. Your system must verify the token, store the channel_id from the
    payload, associate it with the token owner, and respond within 7 seconds with
    a 200 status containing type "success" and a webhook_url for receiving future
    messages from Front.
  - Requests to Front must be authenticated using a bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The bearer token is generated using your application secret key, application
    UID, and the channel ID.
  - 'Requests to the Sync inbound message and Sync outbound message endpoints require
    authentication using a bearer token in the Authorization header. Generate an API
    token through the steps described in the documentation section above, then include
    it as Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN in request headers.'
  - Webhook requests from Front include signature validation using HMAC SHA256. Extract
    the X-Front-Signature and X-Front-Request-Timestamp headers from incoming requests.
    Concatenate the timestamp and JSON request body (delimited by a colon; use the
    string "undefined" for GET/DELETE requests) and compute an HMAC SHA256 hash using
    your App Channel Secret Key. Verify the computed hash matches the X-Front-Signature
    header value. Also check that X-Front-Request-Timestamp is recent (recommend rejecting
    if older than 5 minutes) to prevent replay attacks.
