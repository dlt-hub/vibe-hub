auth_info:
- information_source; https://dzone.com/articles/four-most-used-rest-api-authentication-methods:
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication uses a username:password pair encoded in Base64 and
    sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>".
    Bearer token authentication sends a server-generated token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" and is commonly used with OAuth 2.0.
    API Keys are unique generated values assigned to users and sent to the server
    to prove identity, though the documentation does not specify the exact header
    or parameter name for API Keys in this section.'
  - OpenID Connect is used for authentication, where clients verify end-user identity
    through an authorization server and receive user information in a JWT ID token.
    Clients discover OpenID server endpoints and configuration at `https://server.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`,
    which returns metadata including supported scopes, claims, and public keys for
    token verification.
  - 'The documentation describes multiple API authentication methods. API keys are
    the simplest approach, commonly sent via Authorization header using the format
    "Authorization: Apikey 1234567890abcdef", though they can also appear in basic
    auth, custom headers, body data, or query strings (though query strings are discouraged
    for security reasons). OAuth 2.0 is presented as a more sophisticated alternative
    that uses access tokens (sent like API keys to access user data, optionally with
    expiration) and refresh tokens (to retrieve new access tokens when expired), providing
    more granular scope and validity control compared to simple API keys.'
- information_source; https://dzone.com/articles/restful-api-authentication-basics-1:
  - Basic authentication uses username and password credentials sent in the Authorization
    header as base64-encoded "username:password", but must only be used over SSL/TLS
    connections. HMAC authentication avoids sending the password directly by instead
    sending a base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 digest computed from the HTTP method, URL
    path, and shared secret password, sent in the Authorization header as "hmac username:[digest]",
    allowing the server to verify the request without storing plaintext passwords
    and providing protection against header/body tampering.
  - HMAC-based digest authentication using SHA256. The client computes a digest via
    base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 of the string "METHOD+PATH+DATE+NONCE" using a shared
    secret known to both client and server. The digest, username, nonce, and date
    are sent in the Authentication header as "hmac username:nonce:[digest]", with
    the date also in a Date header. The server reconstructs the digest to verify authenticity.
    Time-window validation (typically 10 minutes) and single-use nonce enforcement
    prevent replay attacks.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dzone.com/articles/unlocking-the-power-and-perfection-of-api-paginati:
  - Pagination can be implemented using query parameters or HTTP headers. Query parameter
    approach uses "page" and "per_page" parameters in the URL query string to specify
    the current page number and results per page. HTTP header approach uses "Link"
    header containing URLs for first, last, previous, and next pages, or "Range" header
    to specify offset and limit for the result range.
