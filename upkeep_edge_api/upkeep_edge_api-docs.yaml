    as the username with a colon and empty password in the Authorization header (format:
    `YOUR_API_KEY:`), or use curl''s `-u YOUR_API_KEY:` flag. API keys are company-specific,
    obtained from the API tab in the Edge Dashboard, and invalidate all previous keys
    when refreshed. A 401 Unauthorized response indicates a missing or invalid API
    key.'
