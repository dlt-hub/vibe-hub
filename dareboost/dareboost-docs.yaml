auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.dareboost.com/en/documentation-api:
  - API requests require a user token passed in the JSON request body as the "token"
    field. This token serves as the authentication credential for accessing analysis
    endpoints like /analysis/launch and /analysis/report.
  - Authentication uses a token-based scheme where a required "token" field must be
    included in the JSON request body for API calls. The token is the user's authentication
    credential and is passed as a string parameter in POST request payloads.
  - Each API request requires authentication using a token sent in the request. The
    token must be included with every POST request to the API endpoints. Specific
    details on token format, header name, or acquisition method are not provided in
    this documentation excerpt.
  - Send a token in the request body as a JSON field named "token" to authenticate
    API requests. The token is a user credential required for all API calls to this
    endpoint.
  - The API requires a user token passed as the "token" parameter in the JSON request
    body for authentication. This token is a required string parameter (e.g., "574edfe40cf27f447f1c0512")
    that must be included with every request to authenticate the user.
