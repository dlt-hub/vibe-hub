auth_info:
- information_source; https://mempool.space/docs/api/rest:
  - Authentication for this endpoint requires sending an API key in the X-Mempool-Auth
    header. The header name is X-Mempool-Auth and the value should be your authentication
    token (example shown is "stacksats").
  - Authentication is required via the X-Mempool-Auth header. Pass the authentication
    token (e.g., "stacksats") in the X-Mempool-Auth request header to access the acceleration
    history endpoint.
  - 'Authentication uses a custom header named X-Mempool-Auth. The header value contains
    a user authentication token (example shown: "stacksats"). This header must be
    included in requests to private accelerator endpoints like /api/v1/services/accelerator/balance
    and /api/v1/services/accelerator/accelerate.'
  - The Accelerator API uses an optional custom header `X-Mempool-Auth` for authentication.
    Send the header with a value like "stacksats" to receive customized estimation
    results; requests without this header still work but return generic estimates.
  - X-Mempool-Auth header authentication is required. Send the header X-Mempool-Auth
    with value stacksats in POST requests to the accelerator cancel endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://mempool.space/docs/api/rest:
  - Pagination is available for the GET Block Transactions endpoint using the optional
    path parameter start_index to specify the beginning transaction position; responses
    return up to 25 transactions per request, and subsequent requests should increment
    start_index by 25 to fetch the next batch until fewer than 25 transactions are
    returned.
  - Ten channels are returned per request. Use the `:index` query parameter for paging
    to retrieve additional channels. The exact mechanics of how `:index` values are
    constructed or incremented are not specified in the provided documentation.
  - Use the `after_txid` query parameter to paginate through confirmed transactions
    beyond the first 25 returned. Pass a transaction ID from the response as `after_txid`
    in the next request to fetch the subsequent batch of confirmed transactions.
  - Use the last txid from the previous response as a query parameter in the next
    request to paginate through confirmed transactions. The endpoint returns 25 transactions
    per page, sorted newest first, and pagination continues until no more transactions
    are returned.
- information_source; https://mempool.space/signet/docs/api:
  - Returns 25 transactions per page by default. Pagination is controlled by specifying
    the last txid seen in the previous response as a query parameter in the next request
    to retrieve additional transactions.
