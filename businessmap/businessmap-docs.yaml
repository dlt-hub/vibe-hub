auth_info:
- information_source; https://businessmap.io/api:
  - API authentication uses an APIKEY credential. To access the API V2, log in to
    your account, navigate to 'My account', click the 'API' tab to retrieve your APIKEY,
    and authenticate requests using this key when testing the API from the documentation
    webpage.
- information_source; https://knowledgebase.businessmap.io/hc/en-us/articles/360012393692-Businessmap-REST-API:
  - API V2 uses an APIKEY for authentication. The key is sent as a header parameter
    when making requests and can be used directly to authenticate on the OpenAPI webpage.
    For API V1 users with Two-Factor Authentication enabled, an 'OTP' header containing
    the one-time password from an authenticator application must be included in requests.
