notes:
- Riemann config files are eval’d in the context of this namespace.
- Riemann runs servers by default on TCP port 5555 and UDP port 5555.
- To log to a file, configure logging with (logging/init {:file "/path/to/some/riemann.log"}).
- Riemann supports bidirectional TLS auth as a part of its TCP protocol.
- Riemann cannot shard your workload automatically.
- Streams are functions that take an event.
- Riemann emphasizes dropping old data rather than getting backed up or shutting down
  entirely.
- Riemann's config is a Clojure program which can be broken into smaller pieces using
  functions.
- Events are uniquely identified by host and service. Both allow null.
- Riemann's components are all configured to work out-of-the-box on localhost
