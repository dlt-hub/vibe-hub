- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in nylas
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Nylas
- Some objects may have rate limits
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Nylas requires at least one callback URI to complete the authentication flow.
- Nylas accepts HTTP for localhost development only. Otherwise, you need to use HTTPS.
- Nylas webhooks are not compatible with Ngrok because of throughput limiting concerns.
- Nylas does not automatically restart or reactivate failed webhooks.
- Nylas guarantees 'at least once' delivery of webhooks.
- Requires OAuth2 setup with Nylas.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 client on Nylas
- Ensure scopes are set correctly for data access
- Both the organizer and all attendees might receive duplicate email notifications
  if the organizer is a Microsoft account user.
- ID of the grant can also be an email address associated with the grant or use /me/.
- Nylas recommends setting the time_to_live value for each session.
- Requires setup of Nylas application for API access.
- Most Nylas applications should use the Hosted OAuth and API key method.
- If your project is a mobile app or runs in-browser, use Hosted OAuth with Access
  token and PKCE.
- Most users subscribe to multiple calendars.
- When creating a calendar on Microsoft, you can define only its name.
- You can update only the name of a Microsoft calendar.
- You can pass up to 50 email addresses in an Availability request, but a large list
  might slow down response times or cause provider rate limiting.
- Nylas returns a list of 100 Event objects by default.
- When Nylas returns an all-day event, the end date is set to the day after the event
  ends.
- Participants don't receive a message or ICS file when notify_participants=false.
