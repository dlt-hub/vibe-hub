auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.yabandpay.com/api/en/payments/wechatpay/mini.html:
  - Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. Request parameters are
    lexicographically sorted into URL key-value format, concatenated with a secret_key,
    hashed with SHA256 to produce a signature, then sent in the request body as the
    "sign" field alongside "user", "method", "time", and "data" fields.
- information_source; https://docs.yabandpay.com/api/en/split/cancelsplitpayment.html:
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature validation. Include user ID, timestamp,
    and method in the request, then generate a signature by concatenating all parameters
    in lexicographical order with URL key-value format, hashing with a secret_key
    using SHA256, and sending the signature in the sign field.


    Key fields: user (merchant ID), sign (HMAC-SHA256 hex digest), method (API method
    identifier like "v3.SplitPayment"), time (Unix timestamp), and data (request parameters).
    The signature string must include command, method, nonce_string, reference_id,
    split_id, time, and user parameters in lexicographical order before hashing.'
