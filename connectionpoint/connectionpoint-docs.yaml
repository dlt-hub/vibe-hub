auth_info:
- information_source; https://api-reference.connectionpoint.com/:
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer APP_ACCESS_TOKEN". The token is
    obtained from the OAuth2 endpoint at aging.connectionpoint.com/v1/oauth2/token.
    Rate limits are tracked via response headers X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining,
    and X-RateLimit-Reset, with a default limit of 1,000 authorized requests per hour.'
  - 'ConnectionPoint uses OAuth 2.0 with access tokens passed in the Authorization
    header. Every API request requires either a user access token or an app access
    token sent as Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN in the HTTP request headers.
    Client applications must be registered and approved before interacting with the
    API.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with optional PKCE support. To obtain a user access
    token, POST to /oauth2/token with grant_type=authorization_code, client_id, client_secret
    (or code_verifier if PKCE is used), redirect_uri, and code. The response includes
    access_token with token_type "Bearer", user_id, and optional expires_in. Use the
    access_token in subsequent API requests.
  - Requests to this API require a user access token passed as an authorization credential.
    The specific header name and token format are not explicitly detailed in the provided
    documentation excerpt, but the authorization scheme is identified as user_access_token.
  - The API uses user access tokens for authorization. Include the user_access_token
    in the request (typically as a Bearer token in the Authorization header). Requests
    without valid authentication return 401 Unauthorized responses.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-reference.connectionpoint.com/:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, default 20, maximum 50) and
    after (cursor query parameter, optional) request parameters. The response includes
    after_cursor (optional string) to retrieve the next page by passing it as the
    after parameter in the next request.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with query parameters offset and max_results
    (optional, default values not specified). Response includes total_results for
    total count, max_results for page size, offset for current position, and after_cursor
    for cursor-based continuation; increment offset by max_results to fetch next page
    until offset reaches total_results.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based navigation with query parameters. Request parameter:
    offset (required, object PaginationInfo). Response fields: total_results (total
    count), max_results (page size), offset (current position), after_cursor (next
    page indicator).'
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with the following request parameters: offset
    (optional, query parameter, default 0) and max_results (optional, query parameter).
    The response includes total_results (total number of entries), max_results (page
    size), offset (current position), and after_cursor (for cursor-based navigation).
    Increment offset by max_results to fetch the next page until offset plus max_results
    exceeds total_results.'
  - The API uses pagination with a required `PaginationInf` object parameter. The
    response returns campaign entries in an `entries` array, but the documentation
    does not specify how to construct pagination requests, what fields control page
    navigation, or when to stop iterating.
