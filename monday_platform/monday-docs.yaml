notes:
- The API analytics dashboard is only available for Enterprise accounts
- Data refreshes approximately every 10 minutes
- API playground allows for testing GraphQL queries in your browser
- Simplifies interactions with monday.com's GraphQL platform API by providing operations
  for common endpoints
- API tokens are personal to each user and reflect UI permissions
- Token regeneration immediately invalidates the current token
- Guests cannot access an API key but can utilize API features through other authentication
  methods like OAuth or a shortLivedToken
- Viewers, deactivated or disabled users, users with unconfirmed emails, or users
  on student accounts cannot access the API
- JSON or String values are required for mutations; different columns accept different
  formats.
- 'Beta: This feature is in testing and may change as improvements are made.'
- Claude for Desktop is not yet supported on Linux.
- Disabling TLS verification by setting NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to "0" is a security
  risk and should only be used in development environments, never in production.
- Beta feature; subject to change
- The analytics dashboard is only available for Enterprise accounts
- Some queries do not support cursor-based pagination or the `page` argument
- Use webhooks instead of polling the API to receive live alerts, which is more efficient
- Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Cursor expires 60 minutes after initial request
