- The HEPA/UV Module should only be used indoors in an environment with stable ambient
  conditions.
- The HEPA/UV Module should not be powered on or used in conditions outside of the
  acceptable operating conditions.
- The Absorbance Plate Reader emits light in the visible spectrum at 450 nm (blue),
  562 nm (green), 600 nm (orange), and 650 nm (red).
- The Absorbance Plate Reader has a single status light on the lid that illuminates
  in different colors and patterns to indicate various operating conditions.
- Always plug the power cable into a grounded outlet.
- Make sure that the power cable is not obstructed, in case it needs to be disconnected.
- The air cleaning system of the Flex HEPA/UV Module meets ISO-5 clean bench standards.
- This module is designed for use with the Flex robot only.
- It cannot be used with the OT-2 robot or as standalone equipment.

- Do not turn on the UV lights during a protocol run.
- Do not use acetone to clean the HEPA/UV Module.
- Do not disassemble the HEPA/UV Module and attempt to clean its internal electronic
  components.
- The Flex HEPA/UV Module uses a two-stage filtration system to purify air pulled
  into the enclosure.
- This air boundary helps protect samples inside the Flex from external contamination.
- Direct exposure to UV-C light can damage your eyes and exposed skin. Always take
  care to protect your eyes and skin from exposure while the UV lights are on.
- Properly attach a fixture or deck plate cover in every deck slot before turning
  the UV lights on. Never operate the UV lights with empty deck cutouts.
- The Thermocycler should only be used indoors on a sturdy, dry, flat horizontal surface.
- Do not power on or use in conditions outside of the acceptable operating conditions.
- 'Do not set the plate temperature below the ambient temperature for over two hours:
  condensation could affect performance or damage the module.'
- Requires deck slots A1, B1 ,and the A1 expansion slot for Flex.
- Requires deck slots 7, 8, 10, and 11 for OT-2.
- The Flex and OT-2 need at least 20 cm (8") of side and back clearance.
- Do not replace the power supply cable unless directed by Opentrons Support.
- The Thermocycler should not be powered on or used in conditions outside of the acceptable
  operating conditions.
- Holding the Thermocycler below ambient temperature for extended periods can cause
  condensation to develop in and on the device.
- Do not use the disposable lid while your Thermocycler has a rubber seal attached.
- Only one type of seal (disposable or reusable) should be used at a time.
- Users should not attempt to service or repair the Thermocycler themselves.
- Diluted alcohol and distilled water are our recommended cleaning products.
- The Heater-Shaker should only be used indoors on a sturdy, dry, flat horizontal
  surface.
- It must be installed in a low-vibration environment with stable ambient conditions.
- The Heater-Shaker requires version 6.1.0 or newer of the Opentrons App and robot
  server.
- Each seal may be used for several runs. Check the seal's condition after each run
  and replace it if needed.
- Do not use acetone to clean the Thermocycler.
- Do not disassemble the Thermocycler for cleaning or attempt to clean its internal
  electronic components or mechanical parts.
- Do not put the Thermocycler in an autoclave.
- Caddies are available for purchase from the Modules section of the Opentrons website.
- The OT-2 does not use caddies. The module clips directly to the deck.
- Opentrons recommends that you follow the safe use specifications listed in this
  section and throughout this manual.
- Users should not attempt to service or repair the Heater-Shaker themselves. If you
  have concerns about the module’s performance or require maintenance, please contact
  Opentrons Support.
- Do not use acetone to clean the Heater-Shaker.
- Do not disassemble the Heater-Shaker for cleaning or attempt to clean its internal
  electronic components or mechanical parts.
- Do not put the Heater-Shaker in an autoclave.
- When used with a Flex robot, the Heater-Shaker fits into a caddy that occupies space
  below the deck.
- Opentrons recommends testing the temperature within the sample to determine if additional
  adjustments are needed to meet the requirements of your application.
- Users should not attempt to service or repair the Heater-Shaker themselves.
- Check the anchors to make sure they’re level with or extend slightly past the base
  of the caddy.
- Do not install the Temperature Module with the ports facing in, towards the middle
  of the deck.
- Do not replace the power supply cable unless at the direction of Opentrons Support.
- The Temperature Module should only be used indoors on a sturdy, dry, flat horizontal
  surface.
- Keep the Temperature Module away from direct sunlight or HVAC systems that may cause
  significant temperature or humidity changes.
- Do not use acetone to clean the Temperature Module.
- Do not disassemble the Temperature Module for cleaning or attempt to clean its internal
  electronic components or mechanical parts.
- Do not put the Temperature Module in an autoclave.
- The Temperature Module fits into a caddy that occupies space below the deck.
- The OT-2 does not use caddies. Modules clip directly to the deck.
- Anchors are screw-adjustable panels on the Temperature Module caddy.
- Protocol Designer requires an internet connection and is currently only supported
  in Google Chrome.
- Newly designed or modified protocol files created in Protocol Designer require Opentrons
  App version 8.5.1 or higher to run on your robot.
- Users should not attempt to service or repair the Temperature Module themselves.
- Pipette constructor arguments are subject to change of their default values, behaviors,
  and parameters may be added or removed without warning or a major version increment.
- Currently in our API there are 10 pipette models to correspond with the offered
  pipette models on our website.
- This version of the API is no longer supported on Opentrons App and Robot Software
  4.0.0 and later.
- If you run the cell above, and then uncomment and run the cell below, you will get
  an error because the pipette is out of tips.
- The multi-channel would visit every well in the plate and dispense liquid outside
  of the plate boundaries so be careful!
- The below features are designed for advanced users who wish to use the Opentrons
  API in their own Python environment (ie Jupyter). This page is not relevant for
  users only using the Opentrons App, because the features described below will not
  be accessible.
- Moving with `strategy="direct"` will run the risk of colliding with things on your
  deck.
- This documentation and modules API is subject to change. Check here or on our github
  for updated information.
- This code is only valid on software version 3.3.0 or later.
- 'Always Get a New Tip: Transfer commands will by default use the same one tip for
  each well.'
- 'Never Get a New Tip: For scenarios where you instead are calling pick_up_tip()
  and drop_tip() elsewhere in your protocol.'
- Multi-channel pipette uses back-nozzle for positioning.
- This documentation and modules API is subject to change.
- API version 2.24 supports OT-2 robot.
- engage() and engage(offset=y) can only be used for labware that have default heights
  defined in the api.
- This example uses a CSV file saved on the same computer, formatted as follows, where
  the columns in the file represent the 12 columns of the plate, and the rows in the
  file represent the 8 rows of the plate, and the values represent the uL that must
  end up at that location
- The app runs on the latest versions of macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
errors:
- '400 Bad Request: Check the input parameters for correctness'
- '404 Not Found: Requested resource not available'
- Changes or modifications to this unit not expressly approved by Opentrons could

- If there are any errors in your protocol file, or if you're missing custom labware
  definitions, a warning banner will appear on the protocol's card.
- Protect the module from moisture, heat, and dust during long-term storage.
- Avoid operating or letting the module sit in direct sunlight.
- Don't store well plates filled with reagents in the module.
