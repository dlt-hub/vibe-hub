- information_source; https://water.cybershare.utep.edu/resources/docs/en2/backend/recommender-api/:
  - 'The SWIM Recommender API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization. Tokens
    must be included in the Authorization header formatted as "Bearer <Token>". Three
    access levels exist: Administrator Level grants full access including model training,
    App Level allows database CRUD operations for training data and user/item listings,
    and Open Access Level requires no token and permits requests for model information,
    evaluation, and recommendations. Token request procedures are documented in the
    auth-api service documentation.'
- information_source; https://water.cybershare.utep.edu/resources/docs/en2/backend/swim-api/:
  - All SWIM API endpoints require token authentication. Tokens are obtained by making
    requests to either the guest authentication endpoint at https://services.cybershare.utep.edu/swim-api/swim-auth-api/authenticateGuest
    for guest users or a registrant token endpoint for registered users. The token
    must then be sent with subsequent API requests, though the specific header or
    parameter name for passing the token is not detailed in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://water.cybershare.utep.edu/resources/docs/en2/backend/swim-broker/:
  - The broker uses JWT authentication with secret keys stored in a database for Auth
    Keys, and also uses SWIM user information and credentials for authentication purposes.
