  only one canonical tag.
- Ensure your server sends the correct Content-Type header for each resource.
- 'For HTML pages, use ''Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8''.'
- For other resources, use the appropriate MIME type (e.g., 'application/javascript'
  for JavaScript files, 'text/css' for CSS files).
- Sentiment analysis reveals not just if you're mentioned, but HOW you're mentioned.
- This tab helps you understand and improve your brand perception across AI platforms.
- The page does not include a self-referencing hreflang tag.
- A self-referencing hreflang tag helps search engines understand that the page is
  the correct and canonical version for its specified language and region.
- Without a self-referencing hreflang, search engines might see the page as a duplicate
  of other language versions, potentially leading to indexing issues or incorrect
  SERP displays.
- Make it a standard practice to include self-referencing hreflang tags on all multilingual
  or multi-regional pages.

- Fair usage policy applies to unlimited features.
- 'Maintaining an acceptable number of URL parameters is crucial for several reasons:
  SEO Performance, User Experience, Link Equity.'
- Redirect loops occur when internal links create an endless chain of redirects, preventing
  users and search engines from reaching the content.
- 'For each redirect loop: 1) Identify all pages in the loop, 2) Determine which page
  should be the final destination, 3) Update all redirects to point directly to that
  final destination, 4) Update any direct links to point to the final destination
  page.'
- 'Redirect loops are critical issues to address in SEO for several reasons: User
  Experience, Search Engine Crawling, Site Performance, Loss of Page Authority, Reporting
  Errors.'

- Large page sizes can significantly slow down page loading times, leading to poor
  user experience.
- Search engines prioritize pages that load quickly.
- Ensure the orange cloud proxy toggle is enabled for proper functionality
- The wildcard character is not allowed in the subdomain. Adding a subdomain is optional.
- Regularly review your pages' HTML headers to ensure that nofollow is not mistakenly
  applied to important pages.
- Use nofollow on specific links rather than entire pages, especially for links that
  are paid, user-generated, or not trusted.
- Check CMS and plugin settings to ensure they are not automatically applying nofollow
  directives to pages without intention.
- When using templates, confirm they do not include a nofollow directive unless necessary.
- Ensure your web development and content teams understand the impact of nofollow
  and apply it judiciously.
- Pages with the 'noindex' directive won't appear in search engine results, reducing
  the potential for organic search traffic.
