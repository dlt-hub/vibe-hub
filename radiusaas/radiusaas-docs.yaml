notes:
- To authenticate a call to the REST API, populate an HTTP Authorization header with
  each request.
- Authentication is based on certificates.
- Choose a CA which provides a publicly accessible OCSP or CRL endpoint.
- RADIUSaaS offers easy and secure authentication for accessing network resources.
- RADIUSaaS can be used globally.
- RADIUSaaS' core service can be deployed into datacenters in Australia, European
  Union, United Kingdom, and United States of America.
- RADIUSaaS requires configuration for both RADIUS and RadSec depending on network
  equipment.
- Mandatory steps include PKI setup, Trusted CA setup, RADIUS Server Certificate configuration,
  and Network equipment configuration.
- This is a mandatory step.
- If you are using any of the below PKIs, please follow the relevant guides instead.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Access Points require a valid client certificate (typically referred to as 'RadSec
  Client Certificate' or 'RadSec Certificate'). This client certificate must have
  the EKU Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) and not Server Authentication.
- Access Points must trust the CA that issued the RADIUS Server Certificate.
- RADIUSaaS must trust the CA that issued the RadSec client certificate on your access
  points.
- The RadSec protocol requires a shared secret to compute the MD5 integrity checks.
- The shared secret is defined as the literal string 'radsec'.
- If you are renewing the Customer-CA or a BYO CA with a different root and FQDN from
  the previous one then please follow the steps to re-deploy this certificate to your
  clients.
- If you are using a BYO certificate with no change to the CA's root certificate and
  the FQDN (Subject and SAN), you can skip the re-deployment step.
- Remember to configure a secondary RADIUS server whenever possible.
- A server certificate is essential for securing both the EAP-TLS inner tunnel and
  the RadSec TLS outer tunnel on RADIUSaaS.
- Ensure to renew your certificate before it expires.
- Under the insights group Dashboards and Log views can be found
- Wait until all your clients have received the updated profile(s).
- Log types not mentioned in the table are less relevant for common trouble shooting
  scenarios.
- RADIUSaaS operates a RadSec service to provide secure cloud-based authentication
  for its users.
- RADIUSaaS provides RADIUS Proxies that handle the protocol conversion from RADIUS
  to RadSec.
- RADIUSaaS does NOT provide failover between RadSec endpoints.
- Log types not mentioned in below table are less relevant for common trouble shooting
  scenarios.
- By default, SCEPman Certificate Master issues certificates that are valid for 730
  days.
- Ensure to monitor the expiry of your server certificate and renew it in due time
  to prevent service interruptions.
- Do not let the RADIUS Server Certificate expire. It will break the authentication.
- By default, we recommend enabling OCSP Soft fail to increase the availability of
  the service by allowing authentication requests to be accepted even if the OCSP
  responder cannot be reached.
- Proxies facilitate the protocol conversion from RADIUS to RadSec.
- Each user accepts the consent upon first login to the portal.
- RADIUSaaS operates a RadSec service to provide secure cloud-based authentication.
- Multiple RadSec endpoints can be configured for redundancy.
- Administrators can grant consent for all users on behalf of the organization.
- When using an Apple ID to log into RADIUSaaS, make sure to not hide your email address.
- For the Client Scope, 'openid email' is required.
- Proxies are necessary in case your authenticators only support traditional RADIUS
  / UDP for AAA.
- Each proxy can handle up to 1,500 concurrent connections flawlessly.
- This corresponds to a time-based performance of 10,000 authentications per minute
  per proxy.
- All rules are applied after successful credential authentication.
- Any authentication is allowed by default if no rule is defined.
- RADIUSaaS supports multiple IDPs for authentication
- Administrators can invalidate all previously issued access tokens
- Logs will be fetched every 60 seconds and sent to your configured Export Target(s).
- For the Client Scope `openid email` is required.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Any authentication is allowed if no rule is defined by default.
- The default rule still requires the presence of valid authentication credentials.
- This is only required if you are using a RADIUS server certificate that was issued
  by a CA that your clients do not already trust.
- We strongly recommend to configure all 802.1X-relevant payloads in a single Configuration
  Profile in Jamf - and one Configuration Profile per assignment type (Computers,
  Devices, Users).
- We strongly recommend to not use any spaces or special characters in your SSID.
- When downloading the Server certificate, use only the green-marked certificate.
- A password is not required, since it is only the public key part that is contained
  in the file and that needs to be uploaded.
- Do not use any spaces or special characters in your SSID.
- A password is not required for the certificate upload, since it is only the public
  key part that is contained in the file.
- Common name is case-sensitive.
- Check that your client has a certificate to authenticate and that you are using
  the correct WiFi configuration profile or XML.
- 'Check that you''ve done the following: Told your RADIUS Server which certificates
  are allowed to connect.'
- Make sure that you have referenced the RADIUS server certificate in your WiFi profile.
- Client needs a certificate to authenticate.
- Check that RADIUS server is configured to recognize certificates.
- Ensure correct WiFi configuration profile or XML is used.
- Meraki does not offer a user-configurable EAP fragmentation setting in its dashboard,
  which can be a significant limitation.
- The UPN/email address provided as technical admin must be authenticatable against
  some Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
- The UPN/email address must have been registered on your RADIUSaaS instance.
- In case your Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) user has no rights to grant the required
  permissions, no corresponding Enterprise Application will be auto-created.
- Not all vendors provide user-configurable EAP fragmentation settings.
- RADIUSaaS will neither trigger an authentication nor send a termination request
  via its accounting port to the client.
- RADIUSaaS will neither trigger an authentication nor send a termination request
  via its accounting port to the client, potentially triggering a re-authentication.
- Windows 11 24H2 introduced stricter certificate requirements for WPA3-Enterprise
  192-bit encryption, leading to authentication failures if the entire certificate
  chain does not meet specific cryptographic strength standards.
- This update mandates RSA key lengths of at least 3072-bits or ECDSA with the P-384
  curve for all certificates involved in the authentication process.
- Organizations using certificates with weaker parameters, such as RSA 2048-bit, may
  encounter issues.
- Intune does not currently include an option in its SCEP profile to specify a key
  size of 3072-bits which could be stored in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of
  the receiving computer.
- Currently the only feasible solution for Windows clients is to use 4096-bit RSA
  key enrolled in Software Key Storage Provider (KSP).
- As Intune's WiFi profile only provides WPA2-Enterprise you will need to use an external
  tool to create a WPA3-Enterprise WiFi profile.
- Windows 11 24H2 introduced stricter certificate requirements for WPA3-Enterprise
  192-bit encryption.
- Intune does not currently include an option in its SCEP profile to specify a key
  size of 3072-bits.
- If the devices are able to connect eventually without noticeable delays, such errors
  can be ignored. If this is not the case, try increasing your EAP timeouts.
- Higher Availability & Fewer Disruptions
- Better Tolerance of OCSP Service Outages
- Minimal Impact on Business Continuity
- 'Security Risk: Revoked Certificates May Be Accepted'
- Lack of Visibility Into System-wide Issues
- Higher Security Assurance
- Clear Operational Signals
- Single Point of Failure
- Reliance on OCSP Service Uptime
- Possible Frustration for Users
- MAB provides little to no security and should not be used because MAC addresses
  can be spoofed easily.
- MBA requires users to be formatted as username = password = MAC address.
- RADIUSaaS is not affected by the Blast-RADIUS vulnerability.
- RADIUSaaS only supports EAP-based authentication protocols.
- RADIUSaaS Admin portal provides features to assign roles to every user.
- If a problem occurs when querying the OCSP responder such as a timeout or incorrect
  data, the application treats the certificate revocation status as 'good'.
- If a problem occurs when querying the OCSP responder such as a timeout or incorrect
  data, the application treats the certificate revocation status as 'revoked'.
- If the OCSP hosting provider experiences downtime or certificate-related issues,
  authentications will still succeed.
- If the system silently bypasses revocation checks, administrators might not immediately
  notice that an OCSP responder is down or misconfigured, prolonging the vulnerability
  window.
- If the OCSP responder is down, DDOS attacked, unreachable, or misconfigured, all
  valid certificate authentications fail.
- Uses certificate-based authentication — no secrets transported if certificate-based
  authentication is used.
- Administrative access is realized through OAuth 2.0 authentication against an IDP
  for identities or accounts that are registered on the platform.
- RADIUSaaS relies on certificate-based authentication for secure traffic.
- The certificates will be checked every 10 hours and the data is cached for 60 seconds.
- RADIUSaaS supports administrative SSO.
- Certificates will be checked every 10 hours, and the data is cached for 60 seconds.
