  - Access tokens can be generated via personal tokens created in the Azion Console
    or by calling the POST /v4/account/auth/login endpoint with email and password
    credentials. Tokens are used to authenticate API requests; send the token in the
    Authorization header as a Bearer token.
  - Azion API uses token-based authentication. Include an Authorization header with
    the value "Token TOKEN-VALUE" where TOKEN-VALUE is either a Personal Token or
    Access Token obtained from your Azion account. The token is passed in the Authorization
    header for all HTTPS requests to the API endpoints.
  - 'Azion API uses token-based authentication. You must include an Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Token TOKEN-VALUE" in all requests. Personal
    tokens can be created via the Azion Console, or access tokens can be generated
    via the API using email and password credentials.'
