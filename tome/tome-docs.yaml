notes:
- Tome is in development and likely has some bugs.
- Tome includes two sub-modules, Tome Static and Tome Sync, which can be used separately
  for specific use cases.
- Tome is always watching your site for changes, and automatically syncs modified
  config, content, and files as needed.
- Ensure that the Tome Static export directory is writeable.
- This defaults to '../html'.
- Tome Sync export directories default to '../content' and '../files'.
- Config sync directory defaults to '../config'.
- Upgrades with Tome should work the same as normal Drupal site upgrades
- Sometimes upgrades need manual steps
- This project has not been tested with every contributed module, but this page will
  categorize ones that are known to have problems
- You should not expect any publicly accessible form to work on your static site.
  It's static HTML, there's nowhere to POST!
- When a Paragraph is removed from a field, it is never actually deleted.
- Tome is in development and likely has some bugs. Please be patient and respect when
  reporting issues!
- This is a guide for using Gitpod to edit your site, you will still need to host
  your static site somewhere else.
- Netlify supports a root-level configuration file, 'netlify.toml', which contains
  environmental variables and commands used to build your static site.
- Your "editing" service's container is ephemeral, which means that any unpushed changes
  in the container will be lost when it's suspended.
- As an add-on to the previous note, when you resume a suspended container, it loses
  any writes that previously occurred.
- Ensure you are using the HTTPS URL of your Drupal site, as Netlify pushes will fail
  when using HTTP.
- Builds sent to Netlify only include files that have changed since the last build,
  which should make them super-duper fast.
