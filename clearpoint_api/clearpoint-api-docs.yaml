notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ascendant's privacy and security policies may be viewed at https://www.clearpointstrategy.com.
- Sharing your reports outside of ClearPoint is a powerful way to communicate your
  organization's performance to a wider audience.
- HTML Reports will have a link to access your report, anyone with this link will
  be able to view the HTML Report once generated.
- ClearPoint offers several options for integrating with other systems and databases
  to automate data upload to save time.
- Requires setup of connected app in ClearPoint
- User permissions may affect access to scorecards
- Revision History stores 120 days worth of entries in the application.
- Users that are not Administrators can click on the Clock icon at the bottom of the
  screen to open their Personal Revision History.
- Series are the columns in Data Tables containing quantitative information that can
  be used for calculations, evaluations, & creating charts.
- Calculations will not populate for a period that is missing the necessary data.
- 'Users who have issues with percentage calculations usually run into the same issue:
  forgetting to multiply the end result by 100.'
- Calculation Diagrams help visualize the context of a calculated series across multiple
  layers, including status, value, and calculation of every series that impacts the
  original calculation.
- There is more than meets the eye when it comes to ClearPoint calculations. In addition
  to basic math operations, calculations can aggregate annual results or be based
  on certain SQL functions.
- ClearPoint lets you set up evaluations manually or automatically.
- Once the criterion is met, it assigns that status and stops reading.
- If you are including the No Information status, select Any so that any value not
  fitting red, yellow, or green criteria will be marked as No Information.
- If you are evaluating a range based on another Series value, you'll need to select
  the appropriate Series in the dropdown menus.
- After all ranges have been identified, check Use this series for overall measure
  evaluation.
- Chart data in embed code data does not update automatically. Refresh the data manually.
- Dashboard hostname configuration is required if not set up already.
- Clearing the cache does slow the loading times of your pages the first time they
  are visited after updating.
- Please do not alter the Environment settings. The Environment should always be set
  to APP.
- The Data Loader will watch folders on your computer which makes it possible for
  data to be automatically uploaded when files are saved.
- It's strongly recommended that only the users working with the Data Loader have
  access to API Keys.
- Files need to be formatted with columns for each element and field.
- API Key is required for access, generated from the System Settings.
- Custom Scripts allows you to make sweeping changes across your account very quickly
  by leveraging the custom scripting engine based on the ClearPoint API.
- Custom Scripts are best for filling in the small gaps that Bulk Changes do not cover.
- We strongly recommend reaching out to support@clearpointstrategy.com before running
  your scripts.
- Access is strictly read-only—customers cannot modify, update, or create new data
  within ClearPoint’s backend.
- Use the Filter Schedules search bar to enter keywords and find results easily
- Disabling a schedule only stops the schedule from running. The schedule will still
  appear in the account and can be enabled at any time.
- The preferred Time zone will affect the user’s scheduled items
- Upon first login, users will be asked to reset their password
- Users cannot be undeleted, there is no 'Show Deleted' option.
- Administrators can customize ClearPoint account to match organization's needs.
- Clicking Save will finalize changes made in the system.
- Two-factor authentication will need to be temporarily disabled prior to logging
  into the Data Loader 1.0.
- For Data Loader 2.0, the API Key used will bypass the two-factor authentication
  so it will not need to be disabled.
- This feature is available for Enterprise Plan accounts only.
- Integrated logins can be linked with Office 365 or Google accounts.
- ClearPoint username email must match the Office 365 or Google email for integrated
  login to work.
- Security is a shared responsibility between ClearPoint Strategy, the customer, and
  AWS.
- Require Two-Factor Authentication will require that all your users go through Two-Factor
  Authentication upon logging in.
- Prevent Multiple Logins is useful if you do not want multiple people using the same
  login credentials.
- Expire Passwords Every 90 Days will force your users to reset their password upon
  logging in every 90 days.
- Reset All Passwords will require that every user in your account resets their password
  the next time they log in.
