  - Webhook signature verification using HMAC-SHA256. Extract the webhook signature
    from the Console (Desarrolladores > Webhooks), then use it as the HMAC secret
    key. Verify by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the payload (JSON request body concatenated
    with a dot and the x-kushki-id header value) and comparing it to the x-kushki-signature
    header. The webhook_signature is stored as an environment variable, x_kushki_id
    and x_kushki_signature are request headers, and the request body is part of the
    payload for signature generation.

    Required headers in webhook requests: X-Kushki-Signature (or X-Kushki-SimpleSignature
    as alternative) and X-Kushki-Id. The signature is computed as HMAC-SHA256 of the
    payload constructed from the request body JSON stringified concatenated with a
    dot and the X-Kushki-Id header value, using the webhook signature (stored in environment
    variable WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE or retrieved from Console) as the key. Compare the
    computed signature to the X-Kushki-Signature header value; if they match, the
    webhook is authentic.'
