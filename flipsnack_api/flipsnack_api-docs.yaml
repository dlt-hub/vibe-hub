  - 'Every API request requires three parameters for authentication and security:
    apiKey (your API key for authentication), signature (a security hash), and action
    (the API method). These are passed as query parameters in GET requests. The apiKey
    must be included in every request, and the signature is computed as a security
    hash. Invalid credentials will return status code 41.'

  - 'API requests require three authentication parameters sent as query parameters:
    apiKey (your API key), signature (MD5 hash signature of the request), and collectionHash
    (unique collection identifier). All three must be included in GET requests to
    https://api.flipsnack.com/v1/ along with the action parameter.'
  - 'API requests require two authentication parameters sent as query parameters or
    form data: apiKey (your API key) and signature (an MD5 hash signature of the request).
    These credentials must be included with every API call to authenticate the request.'
  - Authentication for Flipsnack API uses API key and MD5 signature. Send apiKey and
    signature as query parameters in GET requests to https://api.flipsnack.com/v1/,
    along with the action parameter specifying the method. The signature is an MD5
    hash computed from your request; exact signature generation details are not provided
    in this excerpt but are required for all authenticated calls.
  - Authentication uses API key and MD5 signature-based request signing. Include apiKey
    as a query parameter and signature (an MD5 hash) as a query parameter with each
    request to the Flipsnack API endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.flipsnack.com/en/guide-to-using-flipsnack-api:
  - The collection.getList API uses offset-based pagination with from and to parameters.
    from specifies the starting record index (default 0) and to specifies the ending
    record index (default 50). To paginate, increment both from and to values in subsequent
    requests to retrieve the next set of results.
  - The collection.getList method uses from and to parameters to paginate results.
    The from parameter specifies the starting index (example shows from=0) and the
    to parameter specifies the ending index (example shows to=2), allowing you to
    retrieve a subset of collections. The response returns the total number of matching
    collections and a list of collections for the requested range.
