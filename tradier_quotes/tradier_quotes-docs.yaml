auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/authentication:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Step 1 directs users to https://api.tradier.com/v1/oauth/authorize
    with client_id, scope, and state parameters. Step 2 receives an authorization
    code at your callback URL. Step 3 exchanges the code for an access token via POST
    to https://api.tradier.com/v1/oauth/accesstoken using HTTP Basic Authentication
    with base64-encoded clientID:clientSecret in the Authorization header, grant_type
    set to authorization_code, and the code parameter in the request body. The authorization
    code expires in 10 minutes.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow with HTTP Basic Authentication for token exchange.
    Access tokens are sent in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens for API requests.
    Refresh token flow is available for partners using the same Basic Auth mechanism
    at the /v1/oauth/refreshtoken endpoint. Token exchange requires grant_type and
    code or refresh_token parameters in the request body. Access tokens must be included
    as Authorization: Bearer {access_token} header in all API requests. HTTP Basic
    Authentication uses base64-encoded client credentials in the Authorization header
    during token exchange steps.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with access tokens valid for 24 hours. Obtain clientID
    and clientSecret from Tradier, redirect users to https://api.tradier.com/v1/oauth/authorize
    with client_id and scope parameters, parse the authorization code from callback,
    exchange it for an access token, then include the token in the Authorization header
    as Bearer {token}. Available scopes are read, write, market, trade, and stream.
    Refresh tokens are available only to approved Tradier Partners via techsupport@tradier.com
    request.
