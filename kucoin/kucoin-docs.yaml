auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.kucoin.com/docs-new/authentication:
  - 'The API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Three required headers
    must be included in each request: KC-API-TIMESTAMP (Unix timestamp in milliseconds),
    KC-API-SIGN (base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of timestamp+uppercase-method+endpoint+body
    using API-Secret), and KC-API-PASSPHRASE (base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of passphrase
    using API-Secret). For GET and DELETE requests, query parameters go in the URL
    with empty body; for POST requests, query parameters go in the JSON request body.
    The prehash string for signing must use the original unencoded URL content and
    must match the actual request body sent.'
- information_source; https://www.kucoin.com/docs-new/rest/broker/api-broker/fast-api:
  - KuCoin uses OAuth2 with authorization code flow. Send bearer token in Authorization
    header as "bearer {token}". The API returns apiKey, secret, and passphrase credentials.
    Auth scopes include API_COMMON, API_FUTURES, API_SPOT, API_EARN, API_TRANSFER,
    and API_MARGIN. No withdrawal authorization is allowed for broker users.
  - KuCoin uses OAuth2.0 authorization code flow. The broker exchanges a client_secret
    and authorization code to obtain an access_token and refresh_token. The access_token
    must be sent in the Authorization header for all API requests and is valid for
    1 hour; the refresh_token is valid for 3 days and is used to obtain a new access_token
    when the previous one expires.
- information_source; https://www.kucoin.com/docs-new/rest/futures-trading/orders/add-order-test:
  - Add Order Test endpoint uses private API authentication. Requests require KC-API-SIGN
    (HMAC-SHA256 signature), KC-API-KEY (API key), KC-API-TIMESTAMP (Unix timestamp
    in milliseconds), and KC-API-PASSPHRASE (passphrase) sent as HTTP headers. The
    signature is computed from timestamp, method, request path, and request body using
    your API secret as the key.
