auth_info:
- information_source; https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/:
  - API keys should be sent in request headers rather than URL query parameters. The
    correct approach is to include the API key as a header (e.g., Authorization header
    with a bearer token, or a custom header like X-API-Key) rather than exposing it
    in the URL query string, since URLs may be logged in web server access logs. Generate
    unique token IDs that can be easily reset instead of including usernames and passwords
    directly.
  - HTTP Basic Auth with a randomly generated access token delivered in the username
    field over HTTPS. The token should never be exposed in URLs; instead, send it
    via the Authorization header using Basic Auth encoding (base64(token:password)
    or base64(token:)).
- information_source; https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/:
  - Login is performed by POST-ing credentials to /auth, and logout by DELETE-ing
    to /auth or using /auth?action=logout. Session management supports user-specific
    endpoints like /user/{user_id}/auth to retrieve session history and /user/{user_id}/auth?active=yes
    to list currently active sessions. The documentation does not specify the exact
    credential format, header names, or authentication scheme required.
  - The documentation excerpt describes a RESTful API authentication approach using
    HTTP Basic Auth for initial credential exchange and bearer tokens for subsequent
    requests. Clients authenticate at the /authenticate endpoint with HTTP Basic Auth
    credentials to obtain a bearer token, then include this token with each subsequent
    request. The token is self-contained, includes user authentication info, has limited
    validity, and can be refreshed using the expiring token before it expires. An
    alternative pattern suggests POST /auth for login and DELETE /auth for logout
    operations.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://restfulapi.net/api-pagination-sorting-filtering/:
  - Pagination uses Link headers with rel="self", rel="first", rel="prev", rel="next",
    and rel="last" to navigate pages. Query parameters page and size control pagination,
    with default size of 10 books per response. Construct subsequent requests using
    the URLs provided in Link headers.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (0-indexed) and size (items per page, default
    20). Link header provides navigation with rel="self", rel="first", rel="next",
    and rel="last" containing full URLs for each page. Stop paginating when the current
    page is the last page. Optional orderBy parameter accepts comma-separated field
    names with optional asc/desc suffixes for sorting.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (zero-indexed) and size (items per page)
    in the request URL. The response includes Link headers with rel values of self,
    first, next, last, and prev (when available) containing full URLs for navigation.
    The size parameter is flexible; servers honor smaller requests but may paginate
    larger requests internally using server defaults.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page and size to request specific pages. Response
    includes Link header with rel="first", "prev", "next", "last" URLs, plus headers
    X-Total-Items, X-Page, X-Page-Size, X-Total-Pages. Response body contains page
    object with size, totalElements, totalPages, number fields. Stop paginating when
    reaching the last page or when next link is absent.
- information_source; https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/:
  - Use query parameters startIndex (offset, starting at 0) and size (page size, example
    20 records) to paginate collections. Response structure for pagination fields
    is not specified in this documentation.
