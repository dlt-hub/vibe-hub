auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gate.com/docs/developers/apiv4/:
  - API authentication requires an API key and secret to generate HMAC signatures.
    Include the API key in the `X-Gate-Access-Key` header and pass a computed signature
    via the `X-Gate-Access-Sign` header. The signature is generated using HMAC-SHA512
    with the HTTP method, request path, query parameters, body, and a timestamp. Include
    the timestamp in the `X-Gate-Access-Time` header. Refer to the Authentication
    section for the gen_sign implementation details.
  - API authentication requires an API key and secret used to generate HMAC signatures.
    The `gen_sign` function creates signed headers for requests by computing an HMAC-SHA512
    signature over the HTTP method, request path, query parameters, and body. Include
    the resulting signature headers (generated via `gen_sign`) in all requests to
    the API endpoint. Store credentials in `key` and `secret` variables corresponding
    to your API key and secret respectively.
  - 'API authentication uses HMAC-SHA512 signature scheme. Send three headers: KEY
    (API key), Timestamp (Unix timestamp), and SIGN (HMAC-SHA512 signature of the
    request string). The signature is computed from method, URL path, query parameters,
    SHA512 hash of request body, and timestamp, then signed with your API secret using
    HMAC-SHA512.'
  - API key and HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication is required. Include the API
    key and a computed signature in request headers via the gen_sign function, which
    takes the HTTP method, request path, and query parameters to generate authentication
    headers.
  - API key and HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication is required. Include the signature
    in request headers via the gen_sign function, which signs the HTTP method, request
    path, query parameters, and request body. Refer to the Authentication section
    for gen_sign implementation details.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.gate.com/docs/developers/apiv4/:
  - Page and limit query parameters are used for pagination. Page is an optional integer(int32)
    for the page number, and limit is an optional integer for the maximum number of
    results per page. The response includes currency and balance fields, but no explicit
    next/previous navigation fields are documented.
  - Page number is controlled by page query parameter (optional, integer). Limit query
    parameter (optional, integer) controls maximum number of results per request.
    Response structure for pagination fields is not specified in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, controls maximum number of results)
    and offset (query parameter, optional, list offset starting from 0) parameters
    to navigate through results.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, integer) to specify maximum
    number of records returned per request. The from and to query parameters (optional,
    int64) filter results by timestamp range but do not control pagination directly.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, maximum number of records) and
    offset (query parameter, optional, list offset starting position) to navigate
    through settlement history results.
