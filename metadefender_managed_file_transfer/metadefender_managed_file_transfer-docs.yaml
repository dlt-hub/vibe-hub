auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.opswat.com/docs/mdcore/metadefender-core:
  - API requests require an API key passed in the apikey header. The apikey header
    must be included in requests to authenticate and authorize access to protected
    endpoints.
  - 'Authentication uses a session-based approach. Call POST /login with username
    and password in the request body to obtain a session_id, then pass that session_id
    as the apikey header in subsequent API requests.


    Key details: POST /login accepts JSON body with fields user (string, username)
    and password (string, user password). The response provides a session_id that
    must be sent as the apikey header for protected endpoints. LDAP, Active Directory,
    and SAML integrations are also supported for authentication.'
- information_source; https://www.opswat.com/docs/mdmft/v3.5.0/integrations/rest-apis-for-developers:
  - 'Each REST API call requires authentication via one of three methods: an authentication
    key, user credentials (username and password), or API Keys. The documentation
    references API Keys configuration but does not specify exact header names, parameter
    names, or how to send these credentials in requests.'
- information_source; https://www.opswat.com/docs/mdmft/v3.6.1/integrations/rest-apis-for-developers:
  - All endpoints require an Authorization header obtained by calling the "Request
    an API Key" endpoint. The authentication key has a limited lifetime and must be
    refreshed to avoid expiration.
  - 'Each REST API call requires authentication via one of three methods: an authentication
    key, user credentials (username and password), or an API Key. The specific authentication
    mechanism and header/parameter names are not detailed in this excerpt.'
