  : - The login method returns a cookie named "IxiaAuth" containing a session ID that
      must be included in every subsequent API call for authentication. All REST endpoints
      require HTTPS for security. The cookie should be passed with each request to
      maintain and authenticate the same session.

  : - The API requires an active session to access endpoints. A 401 response indicates
      no session is present. Session authentication is required but specific credential
      transmission details (headers, parameters, or session management) are not documented
      in this excerpt.
