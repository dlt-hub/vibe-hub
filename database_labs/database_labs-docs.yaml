auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.databaselabs.io/developers/:
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic authentication with an API key and API secret
    obtained from the account settings. Send the API key as the username and API secret
    as the password in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme.
  - All API calls must be authenticated using an API key and an API secret sent via
    HTTPS to endpoints starting with https://www.databaselabs.io/api/. The documentation
    does not specify the exact header names, parameter names, or transmission method
    for these credentials.
- information_source; https://www.databaselabs.io/developers/api/:
  - API key authentication is required and passed via HTTP Basic Auth using the `-a`
    flag with credentials. The API returns a 401 Unauthorized status if the API key
    or API secret are invalid, with case sensitivity required.
  - API key authentication is required, passed as HTTP Basic Auth credentials. The
    401 Unauthorized response indicates invalid API key or API secret; credentials
    are case-sensitive and should be provided via the -a flag (or Authorization header
    with base64-encoded credentials).
  - HTTP Basic authentication is required for all API calls. Credentials consist of
    an API key and API secret, which must be sent as HTTP Basic Auth (base64-encoded
    username:password in the Authorization header). For detailed setup instructions,
    refer to the Developer's guide.
