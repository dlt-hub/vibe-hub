  - API key required. Create an API key at https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api
    and send it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token when making requests
    to https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send your OpenAI API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", where YOUR_API_KEY is your actual API key stored
    in the secret variable.
  - The Lambda function uses Bearer token authentication. The API key is retrieved
    from the API_KEY environment variable and must be sent in the Authorization header
    with the format "Bearer {api_key}". If the header does not match this format and
    value, the function returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

  - The webhook signature is a SHA1 hash of the payload concatenated with your Webhook
    Token, used to verify webhook authenticity. To receive judgment webhooks, set
    the send_judgments_webhook attribute to TRUE via a PUT request including your
    api_key query parameter. The signature validation should be computed as sha1_hash(payload
    + webhook_token) and compared against the received signature header.

  - Appen API uses API key authentication passed as a query parameter. Include the
    API key in the request query string with the parameter name `key` set to your
    Appen API key value (e.g., `?key=Your_Appen_API_Key`). The API key must be obtained
    from your Appen account and included in every request to authenticate.
