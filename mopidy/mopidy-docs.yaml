notes:
- Mopidy has a lot of config values you can tweak, but you only need to change a few
  to get up and running.
- The last known working version of libshout3 is v2.4.1, this is the version available
  in Debian Buster.
- Newer versions of this library, such as those found in Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian Bullseye
  are bugged and render GStreamer’s shout2send sink broken and unusable.
- You cannot stream from Mopidy via Icecast with the below method when using Ubuntu
  20.04 or Debian Bullseye.
- 'If you get stuck, you can get help at the our Discourse forum or in the #mopidy-users
  stream on Zulip chat.'
- If you stumble into a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue in the
  issue tracker.
- Mopidy uses GStreamer’s autoaudiosink to play audio.
- Mopidy 3.0 requires Python 3.7 or newer.
- All extensions must be updated to work on Python 3.7 and newer.
- Mopidy has some non-Python dependencies which may be tricky to install.
- Always run `tox` before pushing your changes to GitHub.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Mopidy no longer runs on Python 2.
- All extensions must include an enabled config which normally should default to true.
- Provide good defaults for all config values so that as few users as possible will
  need to change them.
- To generate a few graphs which are part of the documentation, you need to install
  the graphviz package.
- This documentation serves both as a checklist, to reduce the project’s dependency
  on key individuals, and as a stepping stone to more automation.
- Mopidy extensions must be licensed under an Apache 2.0, BSD, MIT or more liberal
  license.
- Default configuration for the extension is defined in the ext.conf file.
- Mopidy is a music server which can play music from multiple sources.
errors:
- If Mopidy hangs without an obvious explanation, you can send the SIGUSR1 signal
  to the Mopidy process.
