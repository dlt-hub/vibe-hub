auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.grow.com/hc/en-us/articles/23157530208013-Custom-REST-API:
  - 'Three authentication methods are available: Authorization Header (token-based),
    Basic Auth (username and password), and OAuth2 (requiring Client ID, Client Secret,
    authorization URL, and token URL for automatic token refresh).'
- information_source; https://help.grow.com/hc/en-us/articles/23157546549389-REST-API:
  - API tokens or keys are unique account-specific credentials generated from a service's
    website (usually in an "API" section) that serve as authorization to access API
    data. These credentials are typically sent as headers or query parameters in API
    requests, sometimes require Base64 encoding, and act as a security layer above
    username/password authentication to verify API access permissions.
  - 'Grow''s custom REST API connector supports the following authentication methods:
    Basic Auth (username and password), Authorization Header (token in header), None
    (no auth), and OAuth2 (requires app registration with callback URL https://app.gogrow.com/api/data-source/auth/CustomRESTAPI/callback).
    Note that OAuth2 support is limited and Basic Auth is the primary supported method;
    OAuth2 is not fully supported.'
  - 'Header-based Basic Authentication is required. Combine username with colon and
    API key (format: user:yourAPIkey), encode the result in base64, then send it in
    the Authorization header as "Basic your-encoded-api-key". Additionally, set the
    Accept header to "application/json" to specify the response format.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0 authentication are supported. For OAuth 2.0, provide
    Client Id, Client Secret, Authorization URL, Token URL, Scopes, and Grant type
    (authorization_code or client_credentials supported); specify whether Client Authentication
    credentials go in header or body. For OAuth 1.0, provide Consumer Key, Consumer
    Secret, Temporary Token URL, Authorization URL, and Token URL; scopes must be
    URL-encoded and concatenated in the Authorization URL. Callback URL for both:
    https://app.gogrow.com/api/data-source/auth/CustomRESTAPI/callback'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.grow.com/hc/en-us/articles/23157546549389-REST-API:
  - 'Pagination in this API connector supports three schemes: None for single-iteration
    retrieval; Next Page URL where a response field contains the next page URL (checked
    in body first, then headers) with dot notation path specification; and Cursor-based
    pagination where the API response includes a next cursor value passed via a specified
    cursor parameter in subsequent requests, with dot notation for locating the cursor
    field.'
