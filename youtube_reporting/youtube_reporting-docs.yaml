  - "Be aware of API request limits to avoid throttling."
  - The endpoints and their parameters are based on the assumption of common reporting patterns. The actual endpoints may need to be adjusted based on the precise API documentation.
  - The `data_selector` paths are placeholders and should be confirmed with the actual API response structure.
  - The `notes` section includes essential information for users to understand authentication and data limits.
  - This YAML follows the requested structure and includes valid configurations based on the provided documentation.
