notes:
- Lint's APIs are not stable, and a large part of Lint's API surface is not under
  our control.
- Detectors should never read files from disk directly.
- Lint checks can be published and consumed via Gradle projects.
- This check highlights string literals in code which mentions the word `lint`.
- Lint's testing API is a fluent API; you chain method calls together.
- This is the recommended practice for lint checks.
- Notice how we construct a test object here with the lint() call.
- Users should be able to ignore lint warnings by inserting suppress annotations (in
  Kotlin and Java), and via tools:ignore attributes in XML files.
- Error messages should typically be short and legible.
- One line error messages should not be punctuated.
- Avoid generic error messages; include specific details.
- When referring to Android behaviors, use API level numbers.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Kotlin Analysis API is not yet final and may continue to change.
- The analysis API isn't stable, and changed significantly between versions.
- Lint checks can be added manually using the ANDROID_LINT_JARS environment variable.
- Lint checks should be included in AAR files for Android libraries.
- Just a stub for lint unit tests
- Handles Kotlin's scoping functions.
- Does not try to 'execute' constant evaluation.
- Users can configure lint using lint.xml files, turning on and off checks, changing
  the default severity, ignoring violations based on paths or regular expressions
  matching paths or messages, and so on.
- Lint checks can target two different versions by using the maxApi property.
- In some cases, lint checks can be made not suppressible.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- Couldn't resolve this import [LintError]
- This usually means that the unit test needs to declare a stub file or placeholder
  with the expected signature.
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'SampleId: Warning: This code mentions lint: Congratulations'
- 'IllegalStateException: Couldn''t resolve this import [LintError]'
