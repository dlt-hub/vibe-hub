  - Pastebin API requires a Developer API Key for all API requests. The key is obtained
    automatically upon membership and must be included as the api_dev_key parameter
    in POST requests to endpoints like https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php. Additional
    authentication may involve api_user_key for user-specific operations obtained
    through the API Member Login System.
