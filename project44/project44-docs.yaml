auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.project44.com/api-reference:
  - All API endpoints require authentication. Valid credentials must be acquired prior
    to using the web services. See the authentication reference for details on the
    supported authentication mechanisms and how to provide credentials with requests.
- information_source; https://developers.project44.com/api-reference/webhook-guide:
  - API_KEY authentication is supported for webhook configurations. The authenticationMethods
    field accepts a type of API_KEY with associated parameters. Error code 401 indicates
    invalid or missing credentials, and 403 indicates the user is not authorized to
    perform the operation.
  - 'OAuth2 authentication requires supplying clientId, clientSecret, accessTokenUri,
    grantType (e.g. client_credentials), and clientAuthenticationScheme (either "form"
    or "header") in the authenticationMethods parameters object. The clientAuthenticationScheme
    field determines whether OAuth2 credentials are sent in the Authorization header
    or as form-encoded body parameters; when set to "header", a Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    header is added. Optional extraParams can include additional fields for the access
    token provider request. Mutual TLS authentication alternatively uses client certificate
    chain, private key, and optional trusted CA certificate in PEM format for two-way
    certificate verification.'
  - 'This documentation describes three authentication methods:


    API_KEY authentication sends credentials via a header or query parameter using
    api_key_name and api_key fields. BASIC authentication concatenates username and
    password with a colon, base64-encodes the result, and sends it in the Authorization
    header with the Basic identifier. OAuth2 authentication uses client_credentials
    grant type with clientId and clientSecret to obtain a bearer token from accessTokenUri,
    then applies the token to the Authorization header with the Bearer identifier;
    the token is cached and automatically refreshed on expiry, with clientAuthenticationScheme
    determining whether OAuth2 credentials are sent in the header or form request
    body.'
  - Webhook configurations support API_KEY authentication. The authType field should
    be set to "API_KEY" and authenticationMethods array should include an object with
    type "API_KEY" and parameters object for credential details. The authParams object
    holds the actual authentication parameters for the webhook endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.project44.com/api-reference/api-docs/shipment-search:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with pageNumber and pageSize request parameters.
    The response includes a paginationInfo object containing pageNumber, pageSize,
    and total fields to indicate the current page position and total resource count.
- information_source; https://developers.project44.com/api-reference/api-docs/order-visibility:
  - Pagination uses pageNumber (starting at 0), pageSize (items per page), and total
    (total item count) fields in the response. Stop paginating when results returned
    are fewer than pageSize or when pageNumber times pageSize exceeds total.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 1) and size (default 30) to
    control the request, with an optional sort parameter. The response includes paginated
    results, though specific response fields for navigation are not detailed in the
    provided documentation.
  - Request uses query parameters page (integer, range 1-50, default 1) and size (integer)
    to paginate results. Response includes paginationInfo object with pageNumber,
    pageSize, and total fields, plus results array containing the page data.
  - The search endpoint uses query parameter pagination with page (starting at 0)
    and size (number of results per page) parameters, plus an optional sort parameter.
    The response includes paginated results, though the specific response structure
    for pagination fields is not shown in this documentation excerpt.
