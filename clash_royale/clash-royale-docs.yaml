notes:
- Requires OAuth2 authentication
- Rate limits apply to API usage
- Handles rate limits with appropriate error handling.
- It is strongly recommended that the logging module is configured, as no errors or
  warnings will be output if it is not set up.
- This is recommended, especially at verbose levels such as INFO, and DEBUG as there
  are a lot of events logged and it would clog the stdout of your program.
