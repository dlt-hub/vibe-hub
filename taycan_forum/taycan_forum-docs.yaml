- information_source; https://www.taycanforum.com/forum/threads/taycan-client-software-development.3633/:
  - MyPorsche username and password are posted to an auth endpoint to obtain an auth
    token, which is then used in a Bearer header for subsequent authenticated API
    calls.
  - 'The Porsche API requires two authentication headers: an API key sent via the
    "apikey" header and a bearer token sent via the "Authorization: Bearer" header.
    Both credentials must be obtained by logging into the Porsche Connect Portal,
    navigating to the e-mobility page, and extracting the values from the network
    tab in the browser console.'
