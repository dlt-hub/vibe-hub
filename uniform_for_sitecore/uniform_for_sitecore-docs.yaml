auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.uniform.dev/sitecore/deploy/reference/api-reference/:
  - Auth cookies are required when calling the render service to re-render Sitecore
    renderings; pass auth cookies along with the request to the Sitecore origin server
    to maintain authentication context for dynamic presentation layer functionality.
  - The API requires token-based authentication passed as a query parameter. Include
    `uniform_token=<token>` in the request URL, where the token value is set in the
    `Uniform.API.Token` configuration setting during Uniform Connector setup.
  - The Status service requires authentication via a query parameter. Include uniform_token=<token>
    in the request, where the token value must match the UNIFORM_API_TOKEN environment
    variable, which should correspond to the Uniform.API.Token configured on the Sitecore
    side.
