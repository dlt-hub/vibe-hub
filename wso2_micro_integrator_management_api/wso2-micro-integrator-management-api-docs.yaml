notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Use `apictl login <environment-name>` to log in to the API Manager.
- Use `apictl add-env` to add an environment.
- Default HTTP request timeout is 10000
- Default export directory is /home/.wso2apictl/exported
- Requires setup of API keys
- OAuth2 authentication may require setup in the WSO2 environment.
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for WSO2 API Manager
- API Keys should be generated after the application has subscribed to the required
  API.
- The latter mentioned prerequisite is not applicable if you use the default certificates,
  which are the certificates that are shipped with the product itself.
- Make sure to import the Developer Portal certificate to the APIM gateway client-truststore
  under the same alias.
- Secure APIs using OAuth2 Access Tokens
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Dual Channel HTTP-to-JMS integration is supported.
- Guaranteed Delivery with Failover is available.
- Advanced UI Customization available.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Install API-M to use Management API
- If OAuth2/Basic Auth is set as mandatory, the request is need to be authenticated
  using only one of them.
- Secure Endpoint with OAuth 2.0
- Enable Distributed Rate Limiting is available
- Message Transformation features are supported
- Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 API Manager
- This API requires configuration of connected apps for OAuth2.
- OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard delegation protocol for authorization.
- The Endpoint Auth Type selected should match with the authentication mechanism supported
  by the secured endpoint.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 API-M
- Ensure proper user roles are configured for access
- You can expose both REST and SOAP services to consumers through APIs.
- You can call backend services secured with OAuth 2.0, username/password (Basic Auth
  or Digest Auth) through APIs created in the API Publisher.
- Enable CORS for APIs
- API Governance CLI Tool
- No authentication required for accessing the Drop Mediator.
- Uses OAuth2 with a third-party key manager
- Production Checklist available in the documentation.
- Performance Analysis Results can be found in the documentation.
- OAuth 2.0 secured REST API that is ready to be consumed
- Requires OAuth2 setup with Google Cloud Console
- Rate limits apply to API requests
- The management API is secured using JWT authentication by default.
- All management API resources except `/login` are protected by JWT auth.
- Authorization is required for all endpoints.
- Requires setup of connected app in Ceridian Dayforce
- Ensure to follow the deployment checklist for best practices.
- Monitor integration transaction counts for performance.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- CORS configuration may be required for cross-origin requests.
- Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 API Gateway
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- Throttling Use-Cases are detailed in the documentation
- Ensure proper configuration of the billing engine for monetization.
- WSO2 API Manager uses Stripe as its sample implementation billing engine to handle
  the payments for API monetization.
- Make sure to configure the timezone to UTC before creating any objects in the Stripe
  accounts.
- Enable analytics for dynamic plans
- Dynamic business plans are based on subscribers' API usage.
- Users on fixed business plans are charged a fixed price irrespective of their API
  usage.
- The Web browser must be a supported version.
- If you have previously used an apictl old version, backup and remove `/home/<user>/.wso2apictl`
  directory and reconfigure the environments.
- The command `apictl add-env` has been deprecated from apictl 4.0.0 onwards. Instead,
  use `apictl add env`.
- Using --password in apictl is not secure. You can use --password-stdin instead.
- Regular Expression Threat Protection for API Manager
- Deployment Checklist
- Security Guidelines for a Production Deployment
- Secure APIs using OAuth2 Access Tokens.
- Rate limiting and throttling policies can be configured.
- Access control must be enforced for resource access.
- Basic Health Checks
- Rate limiting applies to streaming and AI APIs.
- The gateway uses a self-signed certificate by default.
- Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 API Management
- 'There can be different types of environments: hybrid, production, and sandbox.'
- An API deployed on a production type Gateway will only support production keys.
- An API deployed on a sandbox type Gateway will only support sandbox keys.
- An API deployed on a hybrid type Gateway will support both production and sandbox
  keys.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required for setup
- Rate limiting may apply to API calls.
- The Create API button will only appear for a user who has the creator role permission.
- The Create & Publish option will only appear when a user who has publisher permission
  adds the details for the Endpoint which is an optional field.
- The documentation provides steps to configure Keycloak version 24.0.1.
- If you are using a different version, the screenshots could be different.
- Ensure the API keys are correctly configured in the WSO2 Admin Console
- Uses OAuth2 for securing APIs.
- Deployment Checklist is crucial for production deployment.
- For internal calls, APIM assumes the hostname to be localhost.
- After you change the hostname, if you encounter login failures when trying to access
  the API Publisher and API Developer Portal with the error `Registered callback does
  not match with the provided url`, see ['Registered callback does not match with
  the provided url' error] in the Troubleshooting guide.
- When changing the hostname in `deployment.toml` prior to the initial startup of
  the server, the URLs and endpoints will be read from the file system and subsequently
  persisted in the database.
- Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 API Management.
- Configure Basic Authentication
- Developed on ELK 8.1.0 and supported in Kibana versions 8.0.0 and higher.
- Minimum 3 node cluster is required for a production environment.
- To enable Single-sign-on security features in ELK, an ElasticSearch Platinum subscription
  is required.
- Some objects like API may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API Manager includes tutorials for various scenarios.
- API to fetch doctors
- The HealthcareAPI is not secured
- Advanced Configurations may be required depending on user needs.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 with refresh token.
