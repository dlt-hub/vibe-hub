auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.shakudo.io/shakudo-platform-core/service:
  - Microservices can be accessed externally using a JWT with the bearer method in
    request headers. To authenticate, include the JWT as a bearer token in the Authorization
    header of your request.
  - 'Microservices require JWT bearer token authentication. Obtain a JWT by making
    a POST request to `https://{your_shakudo_domain}/auth/realms/Hyperplane/protocol/openid-connect/token`
    with Content-Type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and body parameters: `client_id`
    set to `istio`, `grant_type` set to `password`, `username` and `password` with
    your credentials. Then include the token in service requests using the `Authorization:
    Bearer {token}` header. For Stack Components requiring credentials in the Authorization
    header, use the `x-custom-auth:` header instead since Authorization is reserved
    for Keycloak.'
