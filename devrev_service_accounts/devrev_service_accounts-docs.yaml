auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.devrev.ai/public/api-reference/service-accounts/create:
  - 'All the DevRev APIs require a Bearer token for authentication. Provide the token
    in the Authorization header as Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> with every API request.'
- information_source; https://developer.devrev.ai/api-reference/getting-started:
  - The DevRev API uses Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication. Include the PAT
    in the Authorization header of requests as either "Bearer <PAT>" (cURL format)
    or just "<PAT>" (direct token format). The header name is "Authorization" and
    the token should be obtained from your DevRev account setup.
- information_source; https://developer.devrev.ai/guides/webhooks:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required for the webhook create endpoint, passed
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>". After webhook
    creation, DevRev sends verification requests to your endpoint containing an X-DevRev-Signature
    header with a derivative of the webhook secret that you must use to verify the
    request originated from DevRev and echo back a challenge within 3 minutes.'
- information_source; https://developer.devrev.ai/guides/timeline-entries:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the Personal Access Token (PAT)
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <PAT>".'
  - 'PAT (Personal Access Token) must be included in the authorization header of the
    request. The exact header name is "Authorization" and the token should be passed
    as a bearer token or in the format expected by the API (typically "Authorization:
    Bearer <PAT>" or similar). The PAT is created beforehand and included when making
    POST requests to the API endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.devrev.ai/api-reference/schedules/org-schedules-list-post:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based iteration with optional cursor and mode parameters
    in the request body. The cursor parameter resumes iteration from a specified point,
    mode controls direction (after/before), and limit (default 50, format int32) controls
    page size. The response includes a cursor field to resume iteration for the next
    page.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with "after" and "before" directions.
    The request parameter `cursor` (optional, query/body) specifies the starting position;
    if omitted, pagination starts from the beginning (for "after") or end (for "before").
    The response includes `next_cursor` field to retrieve subsequent pages; continue
    paginating by passing this value as the cursor in the next request.
