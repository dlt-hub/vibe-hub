notes:
- Most integrations are completed within 60 days from initiation to going live.
- Connects booking channels to SiteMinder for real-time updates.
- Minimizes manual interventions and prevents booking errors.
- SiteMinder provides a test account for use during the active development phase.
- 'Active Rooms Requirement: Only rooms and rates that are active in the booking channel
  must be returned in the response.'
- Reservation IDs must be unique across all properties connected at all times.
- Only Availability, Stop Sell, Rates, and Reservation (Initial Delivery) are mandatory
- If your booking channel doesn't support non-mandatory functionalities such as any
  restrictions, inclusions, occupancy details, or extras/discounts, please inform
  us
- 'To successfully complete this scenario, you must have created and sent reservation
  requests for each test: Daily Rates, Multi Rooms, Modifications, and Cancellations.
  Our system must display reservation data consistent with your booking channel.'
- Payment card CardCode is now a mandatory field (if any PaymentCard details are sent)
  due to an issue found where the reservation will not be accepted by all PMSs if
  it is not included.
- SiteConnect operates using a PUSH model, where availability, restrictions and rates
  are pushed to the channel's endpoint via POST requests.
- Integrate with SiteMinder using pmsXchange — a two-way API to push availability,
  rates, and restrictions, and synchronise reservations in real time.
- Access to pmsXchange requires an active partnership agreement with SiteMinder.
- PMS-Level authentication is recommended for full API access.
- All SOAP messages must be transmitted over secure HTTP (HTTPS).
- EchoTokens must be unique per request.
- TimeStamp format must follow ISO 8601 standards.
- All SOAP XML requests must be minified, containing no line spacing.
- Non-delta updates and frequent full flushes within a 24-hour period are strictly
  prohibited.
- Set an appropriate timeout duration, between 60 and 120 seconds, to allow requests
  to complete before retrying.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- PMS-level authentication is required for REST endpoints (Rooms and Rates).
- Partner applications must authenticate their queries using a token.
- The token can be generated through the SMX Admin Portal.
- Flushes are based on reservation creation date (not check-in date).
- First a small flush is sent and tested; once confirmed, the full flush is provided.
- SMX uses SOAP XML messages to transmit data to the connecting application.
- SMX can only provide you with reservation data sent by the data publisher.
- This API is intended to be used for server-to-server communications only.
- API keys do not have an expiry period.
- API keys are hashed/hidden by default for security
- There's no expiry on access key
- The Direct Booking API will only be available to groups with Multi-Property enabled
  in their SiteMinder Platform.
- Groups on the classic version of the SiteMinder Channel Manager will not be able
  to access the Direct Booking API.
