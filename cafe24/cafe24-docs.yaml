auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.cafe24.com/docs/api/:
  - API requests require a valid Access Token. Send the Access Token in the request
    headers to authenticate; requests without it will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
- information_source; https://developers.cafe24.com/docs/api/admin/:
  - API calls require the "mall.read_product" scope for product read permission. The
    endpoint has a rate limit of 40 calls.
  - API key or OAuth2 token-based authentication is required with product read scope
    (mall.read_product). Credentials must be sent via the Authorization header as
    a Bearer token. The endpoint requires the mall.read_product scope permission to
    access product tag count data.
  - API key or OAuth2 token-based authentication is required. The request must include
    authorization with scope "mall.read_o" (order read permission) to access the order
    benefits endpoint. Exact header names and token format are not specified in the
    provided documentation.
  - API key or token-based authentication is required via the SCOPE parameter, specifically
    the "mall.read_product" scope is needed to access this endpoint. The exact authentication
    mechanism (header name, parameter placement, token format) is not explicitly documented
    in the provided excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.cafe24.com/docs/api/:
  - Pagination uses a limit parameter to control the number of results returned per
    request. The limit parameter has a default value that is applied when not specified,
    and can be adjusted to retrieve more results per request.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit controls the number of
    results per request up to an API-defined maximum, and offset specifies the starting
    position for results. For example, limit=100&offset=200 retrieves results 201-300.
- information_source; https://developers.cafe24.com/docs/api/admin/:
  - Pagination can be controlled using offset (default 0, starting position for query
    results) and limit parameters. The response includes a list of issued coupons.
    Additionally, since_issue_no can be used as an alternative to offset for retrieving
    all issued coupons sequentially.
  - Pagination is supported via limit parameter (query parameter, optional, minimum
    1, maximum 10) to control the maximum number of results returned. The since_log_id
    parameter (optional) allows retrieving logs after a specific log ID for sequential
    access.
  - Pagination uses limit (default 50, max 20) and offset (default 0, max 10000) query
    parameters to control page size and starting position respectively.
