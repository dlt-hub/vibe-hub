notes:
- Each public stats API method supports a `rate` parameter, but statsd doesnâ€™t always
  use it the same way.
- Python will inherently bind to an ephemeral port on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for
  each configured client.
- Support for gauge deltas was added to the server in 0.6.0.
- Pipeline instances are not thread-safe.
- It is not thread-safe, so it is recommended to not share it across threads unless
  a lot of attention is paid to make sure that no two threads ever use it at once.
- The socket_path parameter is required. It has no default.
- The host, port and ipv6 parameters are not allowed.
- The application process must have permission to write to the socket.
