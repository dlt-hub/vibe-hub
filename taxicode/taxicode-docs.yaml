auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.taxicode.com/:
  - RSA encryption is required for authentication. First, retrieve the public key
    from the `https://api.taxicode.com/auth/` endpoint. Convert your data to a JSON
    string, encrypt it using the public key with RSA, and send the encrypted result
    as a GET parameter named `encrypted` in your API request. The server will decrypt
    it with the private key and process it as POST data.
  - The API requires an API key passed as a `key` parameter (via GET or POST) to authenticate
    requests. The key is used to apply affiliate uplift and identify the client making
    the request.
  - Your public API key must be provided in the `key` query parameter when constructing
    payment URLs. The key is required to identify your account and is appended to
    the payment_url as `?key=YOUR_API_KEY`.
