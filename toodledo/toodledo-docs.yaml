auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/upgrade.php:
  - Authentication is done with OAuth2. This is much more secure and you no longer
    need to store user passwords. Limited access to the API can be requested to give
    customers more trust.
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/account/doc_sync.php:
  - Each user is allowed to request 10 access tokens per hour via the "/account/token.php"
    API call, with each token valid for 2 hours. Additionally, each authenticated
    user is allowed 100 API calls per access token, totaling 1,000 API calls per hour
    per user. Tokens should be cached and reused until expiration; exceeding these
    limits will result in blocked requests or error messages.
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/playground.php:
  - The Toodledo API uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. To authenticate, first
    obtain an authorization code by redirecting to https://api.toodledo.com/3/account/authorize.php
    with response_type=code, client_id (your AppID), state (random string), and scope
    parameters. Exchange this code for an access_token by making a request to https://api.toodledo.com/3/account/token.php
    with grant_type=authorization_code, code, and client_secret (obtained during registration).
    Use the resulting access_token in subsequent API calls; the authorization code
    expires in 1 minute.
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/account/index.php:
  - Access tokens expire after 2 hours and can be refreshed using a refresh token.
    To obtain a new access token, make a POST request to /3/account/token.php over
    SSL with basic authentication (Authorization header using base64-encoded credentials).
    Required parameters are grant_type set to "refresh_token" and refresh_token with
    the previously obtained refresh token value. Optional parameters include vers,
    os, device, and f for response format.
  - Bearer token authentication with refresh token flow. Access tokens expire in 7200
    seconds and are sent in Authorization headers as "Bearer {access_token}". Refresh
    tokens are valid for 30 days and can only be used once; when refreshing, save
    the new access_token and refresh_token and discard old ones. If refresh_token
    becomes invalid, request user re-authorization. Token endpoint returns error code
    102 for expired or invalid tokens.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/tasks/index.php:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: "start" (number of records to skip,
    default 0) and "num" (number of records to return, default and max 1000). Use
    start and num together to paginate results; continue requesting with incremented
    start values until fewer than num records are returned.'
  - The API uses an "after" query parameter (Unix timestamp) to paginate tasks. The
    response includes "num" (count of returned items) and "total" (total available
    items) fields. Subsequent requests should use the modified timestamp of the last
    item as the next "after" value to retrieve additional tasks.
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/notes/index.php:
  - Use the "num" query parameter (default and max 1000) combined with "start" parameter
    to paginate results. Response includes "num" field indicating records returned
    and "total" field for total count.
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/outlines/index.php:
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with two query parameters: start (number
    of records to skip, default 0) and num (number of records to return, default and
    max 1000). Use start and num together to paginate results, incrementing start
    by num for each subsequent request until fewer than num records are returned.'
- information_source; https://api.toodledo.com/3/lists/index.php:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with start and num parameters. start (default
    0) specifies records to skip, and num (default and max 1000) specifies how many
    records to return. Increment start by num to fetch subsequent pages until fewer
    than num records are returned.
