    access key as access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY in the query string of requests to https://api.pdflayer.com/api/convert.

  - 'Every user is assigned a personal API Access Key that must be attached to requests.
    Authenticate by appending the access_key parameter to the base endpoint URL as
    a query parameter: http://api.pdflayer.com/api/convert?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY.
    The API supports both HTTP GET and POST methods, though some features are POST-only.'
