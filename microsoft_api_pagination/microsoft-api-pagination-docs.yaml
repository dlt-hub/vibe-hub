- You need separate files for each environment.
- You need separate files for each environment (appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Production.json).
- Methods must be [WebMethod] and static.
- Data is passed as JSON.
- No full-page refresh → faster CRUD.
- The most likely cause for incomplete uploads in ASP.NET with large Excel files (45000+
  records) is hitting a request timeout.
- To resolve this, increase the executionTimeout attribute in the httpRuntime section
  of your web.config file.
- Check for requestLengthDiskThreshold and maxRequestLength in httpRuntime and maxAllowedContentLength
  in system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits.
- Ensure they are large enough to accommodate the entire Excel file.
- A large Excel file can easily exceed the default limits.
- Verify that the Excel file is not corrupted by opening it in Microsoft Excel.
- Ensure that the data in the Excel file is in the expected format.
- Use a robust Excel parsing library like EPPlus or NPOI that can handle different
  Excel formats and potential errors.
- Implement error handling to gracefully handle parsing errors and provide informative
  messages to the user.
- Consider using a streaming approach to read the Excel file row by row, significantly
  reducing memory consumption.
- Optimize your code to use the smallest appropriate data types.
- Ensure that you're using connection pooling correctly.
- Implement batch inserts to minimize the number of database operations.
- Use parameterized queries to improve performance.
- Discusses usage of AI tools for various applications.
- bulk upload is only inserting around 5,000–6,000 records out of 45,000, there could
  be several reasons behind this memory issue and time out, Excel read limitation
  possible of reason.
- To resolve this, increase the executionTimeout attribute in the httpRuntime section
  of your web.config file. For example, you could set it to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
  to allow for sufficient processing time.
- Additionally, check for requestLengthDiskThreshold and maxRequestLength in httpRuntime
  and maxAllowedContentLength in system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits
  within your web.config.
- Uses various AI tools for answering questions, content creation, data analysis,
  and idea generation.
- Add a new table to specifically handle transfers.
- Transfer is a unique transaction type that needs to be handled as both a debit and
  a credit to different locations.
- 'When a transfer occurs, create two entries in the Inventory table for the same
  item: Outgoing Entry (negative) and Incoming Entry (positive).'
- Suggest creating a TransferHeader and TransferDetail table to manage transfer transactions.
- A new table for transfers is necessary to capture unique details.
- This book provides real-world ready to use sample code written in .NET 2.0.
- This publication outlines how to live a more prosperous life using Successfirmations.
- Recommended architecture includes Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, and Onion patterns.
- Best practices include Dependency Inversion and CQRS with MediatR.
- Simplified architecture is suitable for small projects.
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that improves code maintainability
  and testability.
- Visual Studio 2026 takes the next step by making AI assistance native.
- For teams ready to tap deeper repository-aware AI, align with the next .NET/C# cycle.
- New features and APIs have been added to make applications more secure and easier
  to manage.
- API endpoints now return 401 or 403 status codes for unauthenticated requests by
  default.
- Enhanced support for Passkeys (WebAuthn + FIDO2)
- API endpoints return 401 or 403 status codes for unauthenticated requests
- Syntax may vary across compiler previews
- Extension members elevate C#’s extension story from 'add verbs' to 'shape the type
  surface'.
- Syntax may vary across compiler previews; the examples below use clear, representative
  forms to illustrate how the feature behaves and where it shines.
- The generative AI race isn’t about “one winner.” It’s evolving into a multi-model
  ecosystem.
- Python is case-sensitive, check spelling of module names.
- Common mistakes include installing for Python 2 but running Python 3.
- All three offer API access and custom enterprise tiers.
- Python is case-sensitive. Double-check the module name and spelling.
- ChatGPT (GPT-5) is the overall winner for coding and debugging flexibility.
- Gemini is ideal for data-driven or cloud developers.
- Claude is best for explanation and documentation.
- Performance optimized repository available for products
- Uses Dapper for data access
- Optimized for performance with connection pooling
- Connection pooling is handled by the connection string
- 'Ensure proper configuration: Max Pool Size, Min Pool Size, Connection Timeout'
- Dynamic parameters are used in various stored procedures.
- Caching strategies are employed across repository methods.
- Registration Closed
- Event scheduled on November 22, 2025 from 10:00 AM to 7:30 AM IST
- Uses retry policies at the activity level
- Catches individual failures during fan-in
- Keeps orchestrator deterministic and replay-safe
- Orchestrator functions are not idempotent by default but are replay-resilient.
- Only activity functions are retried, not the orchestrator itself.
- Uses modular design for building agents
- Strict type matching required between agents
- Comprehensive resource for navigating the AI world within Azure
- Includes real-world case studies demonstrating AI applications
- Beginner-friendly guide to automation.
- Uses pure Python logic and Agent Framework for modular design.
- No-code and low-code container platforms simplify the process of deploying and managing
  Docker containers.
- These tools provide a graphical interface that abstracts away the command-line complexity.
- CasaOS simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing tools that typically
  require Linux expertise.
