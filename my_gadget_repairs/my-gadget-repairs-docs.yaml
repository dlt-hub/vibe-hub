- API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in My Gadget Repairs
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When a product needs to be returned, it must go through a return process, referred
  to as Reverse Logistics.
- Please DO NOT create return if it’s defective and follow the above process.
- You can create a ticket via the API interface.
- Recurring invoices can save time and reduce errors by automating the invoicing process.

  more.

  of creating tickets automatically.
- Inbound emails that do not match the ticket or lead will be deleted automatically.
- If you are on the FREE FOR LIFE or REGULAR plan, there are monthly limits on the
  number of support tickets you can create. As a result, the option to delete tickets
  is disabled to ensure accurate tracking of your ticket usage.

  honour financial obligations (credit, loyalty, etc.).
- Use “Watch Out” notes for behaviour-related flags or internal cautions.
- Under privacy and data protection regulations (such as GDPR), retaining deceased
  contact data for historical or reporting purposes is generally permissible, provided
  that no further outreach occurs and personal information is safeguarded following
  your organisation’s data retention policy.
- Merging customers is irreversible once completed, so please take care to not accidentally
  merge customers.
- Setup requires enabling customer feedback in Settings > Ticket > Feedback Tab.

- Credit notes are created on due invoices to revise which do not need refund as they
  have not been paid.

  the barcode scanner is set to the same keyboard as your machine keyboard otherwise
  you have issues due to keyboard mismatch.
