auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/how-to-connect-using-an-oauth-2.0-token:
  - Feefo uses OAuth2 client credentials grant type for authentication. Send a POST
    request to https://api.feefo.com/api/oauth/v2/token with client_id, client_secret,
    and grant_type set to "client_credentials" in either JSON or form-urlencoded format.
    The response contains an access_token with a bearer token_type and expires_in
    value in seconds. Use the access_token by adding an Authorization header to subsequent
    API requests. When the token expires, request a new one by repeating the token
    creation request.
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/reevoo-reviews-api-migration:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Generate a token from your Feefo App
    Keys in Hub settings, then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer TOKENGENERATED"
    for all API requests.
  - Feefo APIs use OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication. You must include a bearer
    token in the Authorization header, generated from secure credentials stored in
    your Feefo Hub account App Keys settings. Additionally, all requests require a
    merchant identifier to be provided in the request parameters, which is the unique
    identifier for your Feefo Hub account.
  - The Fast Response API uses bearer token authentication. Include an Authorization
    header with the value "Bearer TOKENGENERATED" when making POST requests to reply
    to reviews. The token must be obtained separately and included in the request
    header.
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/reviews-api:
  - Authentication is not required for the Reviews API endpoints. The API supports
    public access modes (all, service, product) that do not require credentials to
    retrieve review data.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/reevoo-reviews-api-migration:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (required, starts at 1) and page_size (required,
    set to 100 in examples) to control paginated requests. The documentation does
    not specify response fields indicating pagination state or how to determine when
    to stop paginating.
  - Results are paginated using query parameters page and page_size, where page defaults
    to 1 and page_size can be set (example shows 100). Pagination metadata is included
    in the response, indicating total pages and current page information to determine
    when to stop paginating.
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/reviews-api-detail:
  - Use the limit and offset query parameters to paginate results. The limit parameter
    controls page size (default and maximum values not specified in excerpt), and
    offset specifies the starting position. Continue requesting with incremented offset
    values until fewer results than the limit are returned, indicating the final page.
- information_source; https://help.feefo.com/knowledge-base/reviews-api-summary-response:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with page and page_size parameters. Response
    includes meta.count (total items), meta.pages (total pages), and meta.page_size
    (20 items per page). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter
    until reaching meta.pages.
