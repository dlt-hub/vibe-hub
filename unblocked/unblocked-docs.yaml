pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.getunblocked.com/api-reference/pagination:
  - The Unblocked API uses cursor-based pagination via the `link` response header.
    List operations include a `link` header containing URLs with `rel="next"` and
    `rel="prev"` relations if additional results exist. Request parameters `limit`,
    `before`, and `after` control pagination; extract and follow the `next` URL from
    the link header to retrieve subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://docs.getunblocked.com/api-reference/documents/list-documents:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with optional query parameters limit (default
    25, range 1-200) for page size and after or before (opaque strings, max 10000
    chars) for directional navigation. The response structure does not explicitly
    show cursor fields for constructing the next request.
