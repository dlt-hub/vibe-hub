  - 'Each request to the Blink REST API must include an API key in the BLINK-API-KEY
    header. The API key is generated from your account settings and passed as a custom
    header with every request.


    Header name: BLINK-API-KEY

    Header value: your generated API key (example: h4536jlkh345l456l35y4543l5ls)'
- information_source; https://docs.blinkops.com/docs/workflows/building-workflows/actions/basic-actions/authentication:
  - Custom 2 Legged Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 to acquire a Bearer token, which
    is then sent in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. The token is
    obtained by making a request to a Token Request URL with specified HTTP method,
    headers, and body, and the token value is extracted from the response using a
    Token Extraction Path. Token expiry can be managed via extraction path or a default
    expiry value, and an optional JWT Header Name can be specified for custom token
    header placement.
