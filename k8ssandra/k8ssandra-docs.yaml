auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.k8ssandra.io/quickstarts/developer/:
  - Generate a Stargate access token by posting username and password to the /v1/auth
    endpoint at http://localhost:8081/v1/auth with Content-Type application/json and
    a JSON body containing username and password fields. The response includes an
    authToken field. Include this token in the x-cassandra-token header for all subsequent
    Stargate requests.
- information_source; https://docs.k8ssandra.io/tasks/develop/:
  - Stargate uses a custom HTTP header `x-cassandra-token` for authorization in data
    APIs. The token value must be obtained from the auth API and included in the `x-cassandra-token`
    header with each request to the `/v2/schemas/namespaces` endpoint and other protected
    resources.
