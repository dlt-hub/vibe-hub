notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Utilizing the WD Community requires adherence to community guidelines.
- L'utente è responsabile per l'adozione delle precauzioni necessarie per proteggere
  se stesso ed i propri sistemi di computer da virus, worm, cavalli di Troia e altri
  contenuti dannosi o distruttivi.
- WD declina qualsiasi responsabilità per eventuali danni derivanti dall'uso della
  Community italiana WD.
- L'utente accetta espressamente di utilizzare la Community italiana WD a proprio
  rischio esclusivo.
- WD non rilascia alcuna dichiarazione e non si assume alcuna responsabilità in merito
  ai contenuti di terzi.
- Enable SMB 1.0 for access issues.
- Network Discovery and File Sharing must be turned on.
- Device is plugged in and connected to internet, but I cannot access to it.
- Check power, network connection, and router. Restart device and router; check WD
  server status.
- If it’s not detected or the file system looks corrupted, you’d need to use data
  recovery software or a recovery service.
- Ensure SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support is enabled in Windows.
- Set static IP for NAS and ensure it's on the same subnet as the PC.
- Access issues may require checking network settings and permissions.
- Press and hold the reset button on the back for about four seconds to reset the
  admin password to blank.
- As of February 2025 Western Digital has separated into two independent companies
  and the support process for your Western Digital and SanDisk branded products may
  have changed.
- SMART is not a dependable early-warning system.
- A NAS box is a single point of failure.
- This is a common issue with WD My Cloud / EX2 devices.
- Even though your drive shows 4+TB free, the NAS reports 'disk full' because it has
  run out of inodes (file table entries).
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Maximum number of downloads can be defined on metered connection.
- Support process may have changed due to separation into two independent companies.
- Check for public IP availability, correct port forwarding, firewall settings, and
  FTP configuration.
- If the device asks for a password, it can be left blank after a reset.
- Unlock benefits and tools for your business such as enterprise support, pricing
  and rebate tools, marketing, loyalty, rewards, and more.
- Common issue with WD My Cloud / EX2 devices regarding inode limits.
- Sometimes the My Cloud Dashboard UI is sluggish, particularly if the unit is under
  heavy operational load (streaming media, copying files, etc.).
- As a last resort, power cycle the My Cloud device and see if the issue clears.
- Make sure the phone is unlocked and you hit 'trust this computer'.
- If iCloud photos is on, Windows will just show an empty DCIM folder because the
  files aren’t local.
- Plex issued a security breach alert to all users stating they had been hacked and
  personal information including user names and passwords were exposed.
- Max number shared files can be downloaded on metered connection
- Users report varying issues with detection of external drives.
- HDD may show signs of failure with bad sectors
- Kitfox software may not recognize certain HDDs
- If your FTP server is not reachable, it is often due to lack of public IP (CGNAT),
  incorrect port forwarding in the router, firewall settings on the server or router,
  or FTP configuration (active/passive).
- WD is no longer supporting the API
- Support process for Western Digital and SanDisk branded products may have changed.
- Access to files may be restricted based on the device state.
- For support of your HDD product, please contact the Western Digital support team
  by phone, chat or email.
- For support of your SSD or Flash product, please contact the SanDisk support team
  by phone, chat, or email.
- My Cloud, Mirror, Mirror Gen2, EX2 Ultra, PR2100 and PR4100 DO NOT require an activation
  code and its setup can be done at My Cloud.
- My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo require a 9 digit activation code and setup
  can be done at My Cloud Home.
- Home.mycloud.com is for the My Cloud Home device, which is a completely different
  device than the My Cloud line of devices.
- The My Cloud will reject any connection to the Dashboard that originates outside
  of the local network.
- The only way to access the Dashboard remotely would be to use SSH to edit the firmware
  to allow for remote Dashboard connections, or to setup a VPN tunnel into the local
  network.
- No other official way unless you do tunneling. Tunneling is the better approach
  than vpn without any modifications to WD’s stuffs.
- Remotely setup with your favourite ssh client like putty to do the tunnelling.
- Can access the dashboard remotely with admin login.
- The My Cloud Home device does not have the My Cloud Dashboard.
- Accessing the My Cloud Dashboard can be done using the My Cloud IP address.
- This vulnerability allows ANY user to escalate their own privileges and communicate
  with all end points of the API at an administrator level.
- The patch needs to be reapplied each time the device is rebooted.
- Unknown if this applies to both v4.x and v2.x firmware or is for only for v2.x firmware.
- Potential security vulnerabilities have been reported to WD by VerSprite and investigated.
- Security breach has been known for a long time.
- WD has not publicly acknowledged the security vulnerabilities.
- 'WARNING: This software only for official v4 firmware (Kernel/Software with PageSize=64k)!'
- 'This archive (+donations): anionix.ddns.net'
- There is currently no fix available.
- Firmware versions listed are critical for security updates.
- My Cloud Home is exempt from the authentication bypass vulnerability.
- Recently two CVEs CVE-2018-7171 and CVE-2018-7203 have been published where one
  can be exploited with tools like sharingIsCaring/twonky.py to get access to the
  name of session files stored on the filesystem and to misuse it to login into the
  device.
- 'To mitigate this vulnerability you can browse to: http://mywddevice:9000 and set
  a strong password via the advanced settings.'
- Upgrade to libupnp version 1.6.18 or later.
- Vulnerability requires an attacker to already have access to a My Cloud owner’s
  local network.
- Western Digital appreciates and encourages disclosure of potential vulnerabilities
  uncovered by security researchers under the responsible disclosure model.
