auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.stack-auth.com/api/overview:
  - Stack API uses header-based authentication with project-scoped credentials. All
    requests require X-Stack-Access-Type (either "client" or "server"), X-Stack-Project-Id
    (UUID), and either X-Stack-Publishable-Client-Key (for client access) or X-Stack-Secret-Server-Key
    (for server access). Optionally include X-Stack-Access-Token as a string for authenticated
    user context; omit it for unauthenticated requests. Client keys are safe for frontend
    code but can only access the current user's data, while secret server keys must
    be kept private and grant full access to all user data.
  - Stack Auth uses header-based authentication with multiple required headers depending
    on access type and context. All requests require X-Stack-Access-Type (either "client"
    or "server"), X-Stack-Project-Id (your project UUID), and X-Stack-Publishable-Client-Key
    (prefixed with pck_). Server-side requests additionally require X-Stack-Secret-Server-Key
    (prefixed with ssk_). User-specific requests include X-Stack-Access-Token containing
    the current user's access token. Send all credentials as HTTP headers to api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/.
- information_source; https://docs.stack-auth.com/docs/getting-started/setup:
  - 'Stack Auth uses three environment variables for authentication: NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID
    (public project identifier), NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY (public
    client key for frontend), and STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY (secret server key for backend).
    These credentials are obtained from the Stack Auth dashboard after creating a
    project and should be configured in .env.local for Next.js projects.'
- information_source; https://docs.stack-auth.com/docs/getting-started/production:
  - OAuth2 authentication is supported for multiple providers (GitLab, Bitbucket,
    LinkedIn, X). Each provider requires a client ID and client secret to be entered
    in the Stack dashboard's Auth Methods section. OAuth callbacks are handled at
    provider-specific endpoints like https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/auth/oauth/callback/{provider}.
    Custom OAuth credentials can be configured by switching from shared keys to custom
    keys in the dashboard.
- information_source; https://docs.stack-auth.com/docs/concepts/backend-integration:
  - JWT bearer token authentication. Access tokens are passed in request headers and
    verified against a JWKS endpoint at https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/projects/<your-project-id>/.well-known/jwks.json
    using ES256 algorithm. The JWT payload contains a 'sub' claim for the authenticated
    user ID and requires 'audience' claim matching your project ID.
