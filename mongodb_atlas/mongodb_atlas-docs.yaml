auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-app-services-admin-api-v3/:
  - Authenticate using a MongoDB Cloud API key pair to obtain a bearer token, then
    include that token in the Authorization header for all requests. Call the login
    endpoint at https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/auth/providers/mongodb-cloud/login
    with a POST request containing JSON body with "username" (Public API Key) and
    "apiKey" (Private API Key) fields. The response includes "access_token" which
    expires in 30 minutes and "refresh_token" which expires in 60 days by default.
    For each API request, set the Authorization header to "Bearer <access_token>".
    Use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token without re-logging in.
  - 'To refresh authentication and obtain a new access token, send a POST request
    to the auth session endpoint with your refresh_token in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token. The endpoint https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/auth/session
    returns a new access_token valid for 30 minutes. Use the header format Authorization:
    Bearer <refresh_token> where refresh_token is your current refresh token. The
    response contains an access_token field with the new token value.'
  - 'Use Bearer token authentication with the `Authorization` header. Include the
    access token obtained from the MongoDB Cloud API in the format `Authorization:
    Bearer <access_token>`. The access token must be a valid, unexpired token issued
    by the MongoDB Cloud API and is required for all App Services Admin API requests.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/api/atlas-admin-api-ref/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNum (page number, 1-based) and itemsPerPage
    (items per page) to control batching. The response includes totalCount (total
    entities), results (current page data), and links (navigation links with self
    and potentially next/previous relations). Use totalCount and results length to
    determine when pagination is complete.
