auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.mod.io/terms:
  - All platform authentication flows supported by mod.io require a `terms_agreed`
    field (boolean) to be included in the authentication request. Set `terms_agreed`
    to `false` by default, and to `true` once the user has agreed to the latest Terms
    of Use and Privacy Policy. If `terms_agreed` is `false` when agreement is required,
    the authentication endpoint returns a 403 Forbidden error with error_ref 11074.
    Access tokens issued by mod.io have limited lifetimes and can expire or be revoked;
    your code must handle token expiration and re-authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.mod.io/restapi/monetization:
  - The API requires the user's authentication token to be supplied when downloading
    mods if certain game options are enabled (specifically when api_access_options
    has a bitwise value of 4 and above or 8). When bitwise value 8 is enabled, the
    system also verifies mod ownership before allowing the download.
- information_source; https://docs.mod.io/restapi/docs/purchase:
  - 'OAuth2 with implicit flow is required. Authorization URL is https://mod.io/login.
    Send credentials as a Bearer token in the Authorization header (format: "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>"). Two scopes are available: read for read-only access and write
    for add, edit, or delete permissions.'
- information_source; https://docs.mod.io/restapi/introduction:
  - API Key authentication is passed as a query parameter and supports read-only GET
    requests. OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens are passed in the HTTP header and support GET,
    POST, PUT, DELETE methods with full read-write-delete permissions. If both an
    API Key and Access Token are provided in the same request, the Access Token takes
    precedence. Default OAuth 2 scope is read+write, and scopes can be customized
    to limit token permissions.
  - 'Authorization header using Bearer token scheme. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer your-token-here`. The token value should be replaced
    with an actual authentication token provided by the API.'
