auth_info:
- information_source; http://developers.bucksense.com:
  - API uses token-based authentication passed as a query parameter. Include the required
    Token parameter (generated through the platform) in all requests to the endpoint.
  - 'Authentication is handled via a token parameter in the query string. Include
    the token as a query parameter named ''token'' when making requests to the API
    endpoints, for example: https://api.bucksense.com/3.0/campaign/manager/ID/?token=TOKEN'
  - Authentication is performed using a token passed as a query parameter. Include
    the token parameter in all API requests, for example token=TOKEN in the query
    string. The token is obtained through a login endpoint and returned in the response
    data field.
  - Authentication is performed using a token passed as a query parameter. Include
    token=TOKEN in the query string of all API requests to the account manager endpoint.
    The TOKEN value must be provided by the API service.
  - Authentication is performed via a query parameter named token. Include token=TOKEN
    as a query parameter in all API requests to the Bucksense API. The token value
    should be replaced with your actual authentication token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; http://developers.bucksense.com:
  - 'Offset-based pagination is supported via optional query parameters: limit (constrains
    number of results) and offset (specifies starting position). Stop paginating when
    fewer results than limit are returned or offset exceeds total results.'
  - Pagination in responses uses offset and limit parameters. The response includes
    a _pagination object with totalCount, offset, and limit fields. Use the offset
    parameter in the query string to navigate pages by incrementing it, and limit
    controls how many results are returned per request (default 100).
  - Pagination is implemented using limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    specifies the number of results per page (default 100), and the offset parameter
    specifies the starting position (default 0). Construct subsequent requests by
    incrementing the offset value by the limit amount to retrieve the next page of
    results.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters in the query string. The response
    includes a _pagination object with totalCount, offset, and limit fields. Use the
    offset parameter to navigate pages by incrementing it, and limit constrains results
    per request.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. The response includes a _pagination
    object with totalCount, offset, and limit fields. Use offset to navigate through
    results, incrementing it by the limit value for subsequent requests, and stop
    when offset plus returned items count reaches totalCount.
