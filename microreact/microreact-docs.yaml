- Microreact uses cookies only when you sign in to your Microreact account.
- The service is provided at no cost to you, however we incur costs for managing and
  processing the data.
- .txt is not a supported file type. .txt files must be converted to a supported file
  type before upload.
- Maps are created using MapBox.
- No information is sent to MapBox.
- Network files must be in .dot or .gv format.
- Users can upload the matrix files with the metadata when creating a new project.
- A local .csv file or the location (URL) of your matrix file can be specified.
- While colours and shapes can be defined in the imported metadata table file, the
  __colour and __shape columns are not displayed in the metadata table panel, since
  they are configuration columns and not metadata columns.
- When a column is used in many of your team's Microreact projects, you can define
  the colours in a reference spreadsheet.
- Microreact does not auto-save your work.
- There is no version control.
- By default, a saved project on Microreact.org can only be accessed by the user who
  created it. Access must be explicitly granted for others to view it.
- Data in the Microreact project is available to anyone with access to the project.
- Make sure that option 'Anyone with the link can view' is selected.
- Automatically republish when changes are made should be active.
- Email addresses of users who should have access must be comma-separated ("email@.com","email2@.com")
- please add @cgps.group to your safe domains and safe senders list to prevent our
  responses from going to your spam folder.
- An access token is required for creating projects via the API.
- The user whose API Access Token is used will be the owner of the new Microreact
  project.
