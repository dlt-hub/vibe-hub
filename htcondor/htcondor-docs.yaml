notes:
- The HTCondor Python bindings expose a Pythonic interface to the HTCondor client
  libraries.
- This is the second major version of the HTCondor Python bindings.
- After many years of heavy use and feedback from our users, we need to reimplement
  the bindings.
- IDTOKENS are easy for the administrator to issue
- AES is now the preferred method to be used if both sides support it
- HTCondor on Windows does not use FS, but rather a method specific to Windows called
  NTSSPI.
- Remote submit requires configuration of another method.
- Authorization is granted based on specified access levels.
- The levels implement a partial hierarchy; a higher level often implies a READ or
  both a WRITE and a READ level of access.
- If the configuration for a machine does not define any variable for SEC_<access-level>_AUTHENTICATION,
  then HTCondor uses a default value of OPTIONAL.
- Authentication will be required for any operation which modifies the job queue.
- Password authentication is available on both Unix and Windows.
- The shared secret in this context is referred to as the pool password.
- Storing the pool password requires CONFIG-level access.
- FS is enabled by default for local connections on Linux or Mac.
- HTCondor on Windows uses NTSSPI for authentication.
- Many tools and daemons that send administrative commands between machines won’t
  work without further setup.
- HTCondor must be flexible in configuration for various environments and security
  demands.
- Security negotiation determines which features of authentication, encryption, and
  integrity checking will be enabled for a connection.
- Uses Kerberos for authentication — requires mapping from Kerberos domain to HTCondor
  UID domain.
- Requires access to various files that usually are only accessible by the root user.
- Token authentication allows low-privilege tokens to be generated for authentication.
- The simplest way to establish a confidential channel is using SSL Authentication
  without a client certificate.
- If the host trusts requests coming from a specific network, the auto-approval mechanism
  may be used.
- HTCondor works most smoothly when its daemons run as root.
- If there is no condor user and group on the system, an administrator can specify
  which UID and GID the HTCondor daemons should use.
- Every executing process has a notion of its current working directory.
- 'There are two current working directories for any HTCondor job: one where the job
  is submitted and a second where the job executes.'
- This is useful when submitting large numbers of jobs.
errors:
- Job execution attempt will be aborted if UID_DOMAIN matches and user is not in the
  execute machine’s password file.
