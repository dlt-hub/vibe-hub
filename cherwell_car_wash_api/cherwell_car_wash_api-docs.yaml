  : - 'The REST API supports four authentication modes: Internal (login ID and password),
      LDAP (LDAP credentials or domain\username and password), SAML (SAML-validated
      credentials), and Windows (LOGON_USER or domain\username and password). To authenticate,
      make an HTTP POST call to the token operation with credentials in the request
      body according to your authentication type. The response includes an access_token
      field with token_type "bearer", expires_in duration in seconds, and a refresh_token
      for token renewal. Use the access_token as a bearer token in subsequent API
      requests.'

  - 'CSM REST API supports two authentication protocols: OAuth2 (where CSM acts as
    both authorization and resource server) or SAML (where an external SAML identity
    provider acts as the authorization server). In both cases, clients receive tokens
    from the authorization server and send them to the resource server to access protected
    resources.'
  - CSM REST API uses OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization. Clients
    request tokens from an authorization server on behalf of the user, and the authorization
    server returns tokens that are then sent to the resource server to access protected
    resources.
