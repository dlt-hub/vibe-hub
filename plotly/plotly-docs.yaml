auth_info:
- information_source; https://plotly.r-universe.dev/plotly/doc/manual.html:
  - The api_create() and api() functions require Plotly account credentials. Authentication
    is performed via the plotly_username environment variable, which should contain
    your Plotly username. Credentials are automatically handled by the Plotly R package
    when you are logged into your account; operations on user-specific endpoints (like
    folders/files) require proper account authentication through the standard Plotly
    authentication mechanism.
