auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.tessian.com/documentation/api/index.html:
  - 'API Token authentication is required for all requests. Send a valid API Token
    in the `Authorization` HTTP header using the format `Authorization: API-Token
    <your-api-token>`. The token is generated separately and must be included on each
    request.'
  - API authentication uses an API token passed in the Authorization header with the
    scheme "API-Token". Set the Authorization header to "API-Token {api_token}" where
    api_token is your credential string.
  - API requests require an API token passed in the Authorization header as "API-Token
    {api_token}". The token should be included in the Authorization header with the
    format "API-Token YOUR_TOKEN" for all authenticated requests.
  - API token authentication is required. Send the API token in the Authorization
    header as "API-Token {api_token}" where api_token is your actual token value.
  - API-Token authentication is required. Pass the API token in the Authorization
    header using the format "API-Token {api_token}". Pagination is supported via the
    "after_checkpoint" query parameter for fetching additional results.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.tessian.com/documentation/api/index.html:
  - Paginated endpoints use a checkpoint-based pagination scheme. The response includes
    an `additional_results` boolean flag indicating if more pages exist and a `checkpoint`
    field for retrieving the next page. On the first request, no checkpoint is supplied.
    Subsequent requests must include the previous `checkpoint` value as the `after_checkpoint`
    URL query parameter. Stop paginating when `additional_results` is false.
  - Pagination uses a checkpoint-based cursor system. Request parameters include optional
    `after_checkpoint` query parameter for subsequent requests. Response includes
    `results` array, `checkpoint` field for the next request, and `additional_results`
    boolean field; continue fetching while `additional_results` is true, passing the
    previous `checkpoint` value in the `after_checkpoint` parameter.
