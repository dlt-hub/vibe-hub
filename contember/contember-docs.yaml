- information_source; https://docs.contember.com/intro/graphql:
  - Access to the Content API requires an access token obtained from the Tenant API,
    passed in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with the format "Bearer {token}".
    The token appears as a 40-character hexadecimal string like "44d7dd8ae4a45c33eaa309716e41e1a8476cda4f",
    and the API enforces ACL-based permissions where only accessible types, fields,
    and mutations are included in the schema for the authenticated user.

  - The Content API requires an access token obtained from the Tenant API, passed
    as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The token format is a 40-character
    hexadecimal string (e.g. `44d7dd8ae4a45c33eaa309716e41e1a8476cda4f`). For local
    development, use the superadmin token `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
    Send the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer {token}`. API access is
    restricted by ACL rules defined in your project, controlling which types, fields,
    and mutations are available to the authenticated user.
