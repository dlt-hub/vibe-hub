notes:
- Users log into BioData Catalyst platforms with their eRA Commons credentials.
- Users who want to access a hosted controlled study on the ecosystem must be approved
  for access to that study in dbGaP.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- BDC3 is responsible for organizing videos on the BDC YouTube channel.
- Only videos offering information specific to the use of ecosystem Platform instances
  will be shared on the BDC YouTube channel.
- All materials must ensure privacy policy compliance. Make certain to block any patient
  information on all content and protect study participants' privacy by not including
  personally identifiable, confidential, sensitive, or personal health information.
- BDC provides general support for researchers on all ecosystem platforms free of
  charge.
- In August 2024, the BDC ecosystem will begin updating datasets, and the previous
  version will no longer be accessible.
- The BDC ecosystem will begin updating these datasets before specified dates.
- This release does not contain any genomic or metabolomic data.
- Data quality management processes have been employed throughout data collection,
  ingestion, deidentification and preparation for release to the public.
- Users are encouraged to contact BioData Catalyst Support with any questions or concerns.
- This tutorial is designed to be a starting point for researchers who have a general
  understanding of genome-wide association studies.
- These tutorials often use Terra’s data model.
- NHLBI BioData Catalyst acts as a custodian of data produced or resulting from studies.
- Provides secure access to data within the Ecosystem for discoverability and reuse.
- NHLBI BioData Catalyst is the custodian of data created and ingested.
- Quality controls at ingestion, and periodically through the transformation and loading
  of files.
- Reduce the time to ingest and release data by working on multiple actions simultaneously.
- Data submission process can begin before receiving dbGaP invitation.
- Data goes through quality checks before ingestion and release.
- Ingestion and release process can take as few as 4-6 weeks.
- There can be multiple samples per subject.
- If there are no samples, copy subject ID to sample ID column, as there can be no
  blanks in the sample_ID column.
- Remove any spaces in the subject or sample IDs as dbGaP cannot process spaces.
- Remove duplicate IDs to ensure distinct subject IDs for consent mapping.
- You do not need to check your data access on BDC-Terra.
- You do not need to check your data access on BDC-PIC-SURE.
- DARs must be renewed annually to maintain your data access permissions.
- If your permissions expire, you may lose access to hosted data in BDCatalyst during
  your renewal process.
- An NIH eRA Commons ID is required for submitting a Data Access Request.
- Users can request access to data by visiting the dbGaP homepage.
- Users must have dbGaP approval to access hosted TOPMed data.
- The hosted data is stored in both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
- This release introduces several new features, including CellTypist, an upgraded
  GATK Variant, new training videos, support for PFB handoffs, and enhancements that
  enable workflows to run on the GCP Batch API.
- CellTypist is an open-source tool developed for automated cell type annotation using
  single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
- The upgraded GATK Variants extracts specific fields from VCF or GVCF files and converts
  them into a tab-delimited table format.
- Includes new features for cloud cost estimators and PFB creation.
- BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra) now supports seqr genomics analysis
- BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE) now allows researchers to export selected
  participant-level data in PFB file format
- Open PIC-SURE is now publicly available on BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE),
  meaning no eRA Commons credentials are required to access the site.
- Unauthenticated users can discover datasets through the BDC-Gen3's Discovery Page.
- The old version of the R API will be available for use until August 31st, 2023.
- Users can now link a Microsoft Azure bucket to their Seven Bridges workspaces.
- DRS Manifest Export option is now available.
- New to BioData Catalyst includes datasets like Boston-Brazil SCD and PCGC.
- The new search interface allows querying at the variable value and genomic variant
  level.
- Data is now available for access across the entire ecosystem.
- Data is available for access across the entire ecosystem.
- Researchers can log into the BioData Catalyst platforms using their eRA Commons
  ID. Approvals for TOPMed studies in dbGaP are recognized by the platforms.
- Researchers may bring their own data files and metadata into Terra.
- Data files include genomic data, and metadata includes tables of clinical/phenotypic
  data.
- Both open access data and controlled access data can be shared across workspace
  environments.
- It is not recommended to transfer large amounts of data between cloud providers
  or regions.
- The Terra workspace’s Google bucket name/id can be found on the Terra workspace
  Dashboard tab.
- You can import data into your workspace by either linking directly to external files
  you have access to, or by interfacing with a number of platforms with which Terra
  has integrated access.
- If you click into a dataset and have the proper permissions, you'll be able to explore
  the data.
- If you don't have the necessary permission, you'll be taken to a page that tells
  you whom to contact for access.
- An app store for bioinformatics workflows
- Dockstore offers faceted search, which allows for flexible querying of tools and
  workflows.
- Dockstore’s integration with BioData Catalyst allows researchers the ability to
  easily launch reproducible tools and workflows in secure workspace environments
  for use with sensitive data.
- Our mission is to catalyze open, reproducible research in the cloud
- Docker technology has revolutionized reproducibility by creating a fast, portable,
  easily shareable method to generate the exact compute environment, with all dependencies
  and configurations, that were used to run a tool or workflow.
- Built-in optimizations to execute a workflow for maximum efficiency and cost savings.
- Running workflows only saves final output files back to the project.
- The Docker image/repository is quay.io/biocontainers/multiqc:1.9--pyh9f0ad1d_0.
- Be sure to create an input of type 'array' which has items of type 'File.'
- The output of MultiQC is an interactive report that is viewable directly on the
  platform.
- Semantic search is a concept-based search engine designed for users to search biomedical
  concepts.
- Data do not follow dbGaP format; there are no phv or pht accessions.
- 'Note that there are two data types in PIC-SURE: categorical and continuous data.'
- User token is strictly personal; do not share it with anyone.
