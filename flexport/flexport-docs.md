In this guide, we'll set up a complete Flexport data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def flexport_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.flexport.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "apikey",
                "header_name": "Authorization",
                "token": access_token
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "bookings",
            "commercial_invoices",
            "documents"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='flexport_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='flexport_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(flexport_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from flexport‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Bookings: Manage and retrieve bookings including details and amendments.
- Commercial Invoices: Manage and retrieve commercial invoices.
- Documents: Manage and retrieve documents related to shipments, including uploads and downloads.
- Products: Manage and retrieve product information.
- Purchase Orders: Manage and retrieve purchase orders and their line items.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Flexport workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@flexport-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Flexport support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:flexport duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Flexport API, as specified in @flexport-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "bookings" and "commercial_invoices" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in flexport_pipeline.py and name the pipeline flexport_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python flexport_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Flexport API uses API keys for authentication. The API key must be included in the headers of each request.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.flexport.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python flexport_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline flexport load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset flexport_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/flexport.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline flexport_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("flexport_pipeline").dataset()
   # get bookings table as Pandas frame
   data.bookings.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Flexport API has strict rate limits, which can be easily exceeded, leading to temporary bans. Proper error handling and request throttling are crucial. It also requires specific formats for some fields, like country codes and units of measure, and has specific requirements for document encoding.
