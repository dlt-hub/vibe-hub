notes:
- Gantt is written in plain JavaScript, so unfortunately there’s no built-in strict
  typing or defined structures right now.
- The typings file has most of the types, but it doesn’t cover everything you can
  have in Gantt.
- Gantt is written in plain JavaScript, so unfortunately, there’s no built-in strict
  typing or defined structures right now.
- The documentation has the code examples, and you can check the official samples
  and examples of the implementation.
- A child task can inherit the calendar of its parent project only if you enable the
  inherit_calendar config.
- When the resource property has a falsy value, the task can inherit the project calendar.
  But when it is an empty array, Gantt returns the global calendar.
- It makes sense turning on the dynamic_resource_calendars config as otherwise, if
  you assign multiple resources to a task, it will obtain the calendar only from the
  first assigned resource.
- Custom solution required for headers and footers on each page.
- The export module allows exporting huge charts in the same file.
- Currently, there is no built-in feature to display the header and footer on each
  page.
- The dev team updated the PDF export module to the 0.7.0 version.
- New features of adding the header and footer for each page.
- It looks like your issue is caused by the timeline having a horizontal scrollbar
  while the grid does not.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
