pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.yapily.com/api/reference/:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with a cursor query parameter. The response includes
    links object with prev, self, next, and last fields containing full URLs with
    cursor values for navigation. Use the cursor value from the next link to request
    the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, optional) and offset (integer, optional) query
    parameters. The response includes a meta object that likely contains pagination
    state, though the complete response structure is not shown in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit is optional (default
    value not specified), and offset is optional with a default of 0. Provide limit
    and offset in subsequent requests to retrieve additional pages of consents.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (integer, default/max 100) controls
    results per page, and page (integer, >= 1, default 1) specifies the page number.
    Navigate pages by incrementing the page parameter in subsequent requests.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (integer, default/max 100) and page (integer,
    >= 1, optional). Response includes meta.count indicating number of results returned.
    Construct next request by incrementing the page parameter; stop when returned
    results are fewer than the limit or meta.count is zero.
