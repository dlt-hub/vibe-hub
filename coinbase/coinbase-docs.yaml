auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-app/authentication-authorization/api-key-authentication:
  - Coinbase App APIs use JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Generate a JWT using
    your API key name and private key (ECDSA algorithm required, Ed25519 not supported),
    then include it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for authenticated
    requests. The private key is multi-line and newlines must be preserved; include
    the request method and path when generating the JWT.
  - JWT-based bearer token authentication. Generate a JWT using ES256 (ECDSA with
    P-256 curve) algorithm with your API key and EC private key, then send it in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {JWT}". JWTs expire after 2 minutes and must be
    regenerated for each unique API request. API key format is "organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}"
    and the private key is in PEM format (-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----).
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/rest-api/authentication:
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based approach with four required headers:
    CB-ACCESS-KEY (API key), CB-ACCESS-SIGN (HMAC-SHA256 signature of concatenated
    timestamp, HTTP method uppercase, request path, and request body, base64-encoded),
    CB-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP (Unix timestamp in seconds), and CB-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE (passphrase
    string). The signature is computed by creating an HMAC using a base64-decoded
    secret key, signing the message string, and base64-encoding the digest output.'
  - 'Coinbase Exchange REST API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication for
    private endpoints. Requests require an API key, a timestamp, and a computed signature
    sent in request headers.


    To authenticate: generate an API key from your Coinbase Exchange account, include
    the key in the request headers, add a CB-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header with the current
    Unix timestamp, compute an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request (using the message
    format: timestamp + HTTP method + request path + request body, signed with your
    API secret), and send the signature in the CB-ACCESS-SIGN header. The API key
    also has granular permissions that control which endpoints and operations are
    allowed.'
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/authentication:
  - Coinbase CDP API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Generate a JWT by signing
    a request with an EC private key stored in the KEY_SECRET environment variable.
    Required environment variables are KEY_NAME (the API key identifier in format
    organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}), KEY_SECRET (EC private key with preserved
    newlines), REQUEST_METHOD (HTTP verb), REQUEST_PATH (endpoint path), and REQUEST_HOST
    (api.coinbase.com). Never hardcode the secret key; store it securely and retrieve
    it from environment variables or secure storage.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/rest-api/pagination:
  - Cursor pagination is used for array-returning endpoints. Request pagination with
    the `cursor` query parameter. Response includes a pagination object with `cursor`
    and `has_more` fields; use the returned `cursor` value in the next request when
    `has_more` is true to continue paginating.
  - Cursor-based pagination is used across relevant endpoints. Include the `cursor`
    query parameter (optional) to navigate pages, and optionally specify `sort_direction`
    query parameter (defaults to DESC). The JSON response includes a `pagination`
    object with `next_cursor`, `sort_direction`, and `has_next` fields. To fetch the
    next page, use the `next_cursor` value from the response as the `cursor` parameter
    in the subsequent request. Stop paginating when `next_cursor` is empty.
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/rest-api/pagination:
  - Coinbase Exchange uses cursor pagination with before and after cursors. Request
    parameters before and after specify pagination direction, and response headers
    CB-BEFORE and CB-AFTER provide cursor values for subsequent requests to fetch
    pages before or after current results.
- information_source; https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/authentication:
  - pageToken and pageSize are used for pagination in the cdp_listBalances JSON-RPC
    method. pageToken is a string parameter (empty string to start) that indicates
    the current page position, and pageSize is an integer that specifies the number
    of results per page. Use the pageToken returned in the response to request the
    next page.
