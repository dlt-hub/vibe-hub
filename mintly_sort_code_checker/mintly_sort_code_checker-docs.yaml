auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mintly.uk/docs:
  - API key authentication is required, passed as the X-API-KEY header in all requests.
    Include your API key value in the X-API-KEY header when making requests to the
    API endpoints.
  - API requests are authorised using a unique API key that must be presented in the
    HTTP header of each request. The documentation states that your code must pass
    an HTTP header with every request, though the exact header name is not explicitly
    specified in the provided text.
  - Your code must pass the HTTP header `X-API-KEY` with every request to the Mintly
    API, set to your organisation's unique API key which you can find in your Account
    dashboard. Keep this key secret. Requests use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 encryption. Use
    the production URL `https://api.mintly.uk` for live requests (counted toward usage)
    or `https://sandbox.mintly.uk` for testing (not counted toward billed requests).
    A 401 or 403 status indicates authentication failure, such as invalid, expired,
    or missing API key credentials.
- information_source; https://www.mintly.uk/get-started:
  - The API uses API Key authentication sent via the X-API-KEY header. Your API Key
    is available in your Mintly dashboard and must be included in the request header
    for all API calls to the bank account and sort code checking endpoints.
