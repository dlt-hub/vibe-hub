In this guide, we'll set up a complete MonoGame data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector, like in the partial example code below:

```python-outcome
@dlt.source
def monogame_migration_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://monogame.net/api/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            A,,B,,C
            ],
    }
    [...]
    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    # Connect to destination
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='monogame_migration_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='monogame_migration_data', 
    )
    # Load the data
    load_info = pipeline.run(monogame_migration_source())
    print(load_info) 
```

### Why use dltHub Workspace with LLM Context to generate Python pipelines?

- Accelerate pipeline development with AI-native context
- Debug pipelines, validate schemas and data with the integrated **Pipeline Dashboard**
- Build Python notebooks for end users of your data
- **Low maintenance** thanks to Schema evolution with type inference, resilience and self documenting REST API connectors. A shallow learning curve makes the pipeline easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses, bringing mature data loading to pythonic Iceberg with or without catalogs

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from monogame_migration‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- A: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to A.
- B: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to B.
- C: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to C.
- E: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to E.
- Pi: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Pi.
- Red: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Red.
- Tau: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Tau.
- iOS: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to iOS.
- Min: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Min.
- Web: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Web.
- Ray: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Ray.
- Max: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Max.
- Tag: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Tag.
- Tan: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Tan.
- Key: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Key.
- Alpha: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Alpha.
- Navy: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Navy.
- Teal: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Teal.
- Pink: This endpoint serves a specific functionality related to Pink.

You will then debug the MonoGame pipeline using our Pipeline Dashboard tool to ensure it is copying the data correctly, before building a Notebook to explore your data and build reports.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - We suggest using a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started!

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Set up `dlt` Workspace**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install "dlt[workspace]"
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with MonoGame support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:monogame_migration duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup the necessary files and folders for the next step.
    
2. ü§† **Start LLM-assisted coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a prompt to get you started:
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for MonoGame API, as specified in @monogame_migration-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints A and  and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in monogame_migration_pipeline.py and name the pipeline monogame_migration_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python monogame_migration_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Set up credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done using an API key, which must be included in requests to access the resources provided by this source.
    
    To get the appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.monogame.net/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python monogame_migration_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly, you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline monogame_migration load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset monogame_migration_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/monogame_migration.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **Debug your pipeline and data with the Pipeline Dashboard**

    Now that you have a running pipeline, you need to make sure it‚Äôs correct, so you do not introduce silent failures like misconfigured pagination or incremental loading errors. By launching the dlt Workspace Pipeline Dashboard, you can see various information about the pipeline to enable you to test it. Here you can see:
    - Pipeline overview: State, load metrics
    - Data‚Äôs schema: tables, columns, types, hints
    - You can query the data itself
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline monogame_migration_pipeline show dashboard
    ```
    
6. üêç **Build a Notebook with data explorations and reports**

    With the pipeline and data partially validated, you can continue with custom data explorations and reports. To get started, paste the snippet below into a new marimo Notebook and ask your LLM to go from there. Jupyter Notebooks and regular Python scripts are supported as well.

    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("monogame_migration_pipeline").dataset()
   # get  table as Pandas frame
   data..df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Rider is free for personal use, but registration is required. Compilation issues might arise on Linux, and specific environment variables may need to be set. Compatibility of MonoGame templates varies by version, and certain features may not be available on all platforms. Additionally, for iOS and Android development, DotNet 9 is mandatory.
