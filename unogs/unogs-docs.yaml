    the PAT in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" when making requests to
    the Workspace REST API endpoints.
  - 'Databricks uses Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for authentication. Include the
    token in the HTTP Authorization header as a Bearer token using the format Authorization:

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.openpublicapis.com/api/box:
  - Pagination for the "Get folder items" endpoint uses limit and offset query parameters.
    The response includes total_count indicating total items. Use limit to set page
    size (default 100, max 1000) and offset to specify starting position; increment
    offset by limit value to fetch next page until offset reaches total_count.
- information_source; https://www.openpublicapis.com/api/dropbox:
  - Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through folder listings. Include `cursor`
    in the request body for subsequent pages; the response includes a `cursor` field
    for the next page and a `has_more` boolean indicating if more results exist. Stop
    paginating when `has_more` is false.
- information_source; https://www.openpublicapis.com/api/onedrive:
  - Use the $top and $skip query parameters to paginate results. $top specifies the
    number of items per page (default and maximum typically 200), and $skip specifies
    the number of items to skip. The response includes an @odata.nextLink field containing
    the pre-constructed URL for the next page; continue paginating until this field
    is absent.
- information_source; https://www.openpublicapis.com/api/zillow-mls:
  - Most search endpoints support pagination with page and limit parameters, though
    the specific parameter names, whether they are required or optional, default values,
    and response field structures for indicating next pages or total counts are not
    explicitly documented in the provided material.
- information_source; https://www.openpublicapis.com/api/spark-post-api:
  - Cursor-based pagination is supported for the Events endpoint. The per_page query
    parameter controls page size (example shows per_page=1000).
