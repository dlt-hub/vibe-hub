auth_info:
- information_source; https://forwardforever.com/how-to-create-discord-bot-with-power-automate/:
  - Bot token authentication via Authorization header. Include Authorization header
    with value "Bot {token}" where {token} is the saved bot token. The token is placed
    in the HTTP request header, not in query parameters or body.
- information_source; https://forwardforever.com/how-to-use-service-principal-in-power-bi-admin-rest-api-in-power-automate/:
  - 'Authorization header is constructed as: Authorization = token_type + " " + access_token.
    The token_type and access_token values are obtained from a prior OAuth2 token
    response. The space between token_type and access_token is required for the authorization
    header to function in REST API calls.'
  - Power BI REST API uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authorization. To obtain
    an access token, make a POST request to https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId}/oauth2/token
    with Content-Type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The request
    body must include grant_type=client_credentials, resource=https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api,
    client_id (your Application ID), client_secret (your Application Secret), and
    scope=https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default. The returned access token
    is then used in subsequent API calls.

  - Azure AD OAuth2 authentication is required. Configure the HTTP action with Base
    Resource URL set to http://api.powerbi.com and Azure AD Resource URI set to https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api,
    then sign in to establish the connection. The API will use the authenticated user's
    credentials; service principals cannot be used as gateway admins for this endpoint.
