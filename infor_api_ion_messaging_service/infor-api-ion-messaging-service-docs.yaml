- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires setup of RPA User role for access
- Installation includes selecting components for Attended and Studio IDE
- Publishing requires RPA Admin role. Contact your system administrator if you receive

  the CloudSuite Analytics documentation.
- For example, in M3 Analytics you need the 'M3A Administration ' role for Edit Dashboard
  access
- Create one or more mandatory filters as parameters that will deliver specific values
  to the condition.
- 'Each option is mapped to its own value: Map → Map, Table → Tab, Columns → Col.'
- '''Data Driven Dashboards'' allow us to show and hide any dashlet on the dashboard
  based on a condition.'
- The condition uses the output from the filter, and when that output is equal to
  'Tab' then the condition is true.
- 'Security role: IONAPI-Administrator'
- 'Security role: IONAPI-User'
- Uses OAuth2 with SAML Bearer Grant
