auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/:
  - 'Figma API supports two authentication methods: access tokens and OAuth2. Access
    tokens are sent as bearer tokens in the Authorization header, while OAuth2 follows
    standard OAuth2 flows for user authorization and token exchange.'
  - 'The Figma API supports two authentication methods: OAuth2 and access tokens.
    You can authenticate requests using either approach, with details available in
    the authentication documentation referenced in the links.'
- information_source; https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/activity-logs-endpoints/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` when making requests to the activity
    logs API endpoints.'
  - 'Figma API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as ''Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'' when making requests to the API endpoints.'
  - 'This endpoint requires OAuth2 bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization
    header. The token must have the org:activity_log_read scope to access activity
    logs.


    Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header is required. The TOKEN is an OAuth2 access
    token with org:activity_log_read scope. Query parameters include events, start_time,
    end_time, limit, and order for filtering results. A 401 error indicates insufficient
    permissions.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/activity-logs-endpoints/:
  - The endpoint supports cursor-based pagination with a maximum of 1000 events per
    request. Use the optional `limit` parameter to set a lower value. When `next_page`
    is true in the response, use the returned `cursor` value as the `cursor` query
    parameter in the next request to retrieve subsequent events; stop when `next_page`
    is false.
  - Use cursor as a query parameter to paginate through activity logs. The response
    includes a cursor field and next_page boolean; pass the cursor value from the
    previous response to the cursor parameter in the next request to retrieve unseen
    events. Stop paginating when next_page is false.
- information_source; https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/library-analytics-endpoints/:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. Request parameter `cursor` (optional,
    in query string) specifies the page. Response includes `cursor` (string for next
    request) and `next_page` (boolean indicating if more data exists). Continue paginating
    by passing the returned `cursor` value in the next request until `next_page` is
    false.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. The response includes a cursor string
    and a next_page boolean field. To retrieve the next page, pass the cursor value
    as a query parameter in the subsequent request. Stop paginating when next_page
    is false.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter cursor (string) to fetch subsequent pages.
    Response includes cursor (string) for the next request and next_page (boolean)
    to indicate if more pages exist; when next_page is false, pagination is complete.
