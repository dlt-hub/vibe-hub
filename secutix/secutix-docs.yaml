  - JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is required. The token must be sent in the
    Authorization header with the Bearer scheme. Tokens are signed with a 256-bit
    secret key and include an expiration time (exp claim). A 401 response indicates
    an invalid or expired JWT.
  - JWT is used as a Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization request header for authentication.
    Include the token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>"
    for all REST API requests.
