notes:
- The list of use cases is being added incrementally.
- Consult every usage of DNF with the reference documentation.
- DNF commands allow package filtering and modular filtering.
- Installing rawhide packages onto a stable Fedora release system is generally discouraged
  as it leads to less tested combinations of installed packages.
- Modularity is deprecated, and functionality will be removed in a future release
  of DNF5.
- Packages installed/removed via DNF API are logged into dnf.log
- 'List of all incompatible changes can be found at: dnf-1_vs_dnf-2.html'
- 'For detailed description see: DNF API'
- Uses basic HTTP authentication.
- The biggest improvement in 0.5.0 is complete support for groups and environments,
  including internal database of installed groups independent of the actual packages.
- To force refreshing of metadata before an operation, the refresh option has been
  added.
- Internally, the CLI went through several changes to allow for better API accessibility.
- skip_if_unavailable is enabled by default now
- Clients should see the message about DNF lock being taken less often
- This version should not present any differences for the user
- The `--skip-broken` option is an alias for `--setopt=strict=0`.
- 'Update and Upgrade Commands are the Same: Invoking `dnf update` or `dnf upgrade`
  has the same effect in DNF.'
- '`clean_requirements_on_remove` on by default: DNF is often going to remove more
  packages.'
- 'No `resolvedep` command: Users can use `dnf provides` to find out what package
  provides a particular file.'
- 'No `deplist` command: Use `dnf repoquery --deplist` as an alternative.'
- Excludes and repo excludes apply to all operations, unlike YUM.
- The `include` option has been removed.
- '`dnf provides /bin/<file>` is not fully supported.'
- '`skip_if_unavailable` could be enabled by default.'
- '`overwrite_groups` dropped, comps functions acting as if always disabled.'
- '`mirrorlist_expire` dropped: DNF uses `metadata_expire` for both metadata and mirrorlist
  file.'
- metalink not recognized in the `mirrorlist` repo option.
- '`alwaysprompt` dropped: Unsupported to simplify the configuration.'
- '`upgrade_requirements_on_install` dropped.'
- '`dnf history rollback` check dropped.'
- Packages replacement without `yum swap` can be done using `dnf shell` or `--allowerasing`.
- Dependency processing details are not shown in the CLI.
- '`dnf provides` complies with the YUM documentation of the command.'
- Bandwidth limiting supported.
- '`installonlypkgs` config option: DNF appends list values to defaults.'
- The usage of Delta RPM files controlled by `deltarpm` option.
- 'Handling .srpm files and non-existent packages: DNF will terminate early with an
  error.'
- 'Promoting package to install to a package that obsoletes it: DNF will not automatically
  replace requests.'
- 'Behavior of `--installroot` option: DNF handles the path differently from YUM.'
- 'Different prompt after transaction table: DNF asks whether to continue with transaction.'
- List command shows all repo alternatives.
- '`yum-langpacks` subcommands have been removed.'
- DNF does not have a direct replacement of yum-updateonboot and yum-cron commands.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- ERROR with transaction check vs depsolve
- 'Error HTTP/FTP status code: 404'
