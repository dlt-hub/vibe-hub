  - 'OAuth is required to access personal user data and manage it. Credentials are
    sent via the Authorization header as a Bearer token (format: "Authorization: Bearer
    <access_token>"). The token must be obtained through OAuth authorization before
    making API requests. POST requests to protected endpoints like creating playlists
    require this Bearer token in the header along with appropriate Content-Type (application/json)
    and Accept headers.'
  - The Create a playlist and Add tracks to a playlist endpoints require an OAuth
    access token for authentication. This token must be obtained through Spotify's
    OAuth flow before these operations can be performed.
  - The console fully supports OAuth tokens and the scopes that you need to specify
    when requesting user data. OAuth authentication is required for endpoints that
    access user data, and you must specify appropriate scopes when requesting credentials.
