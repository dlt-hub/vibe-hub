auth_info:
- information_source; https://parsec.app/docs/teams-api:
  - 'API keys are required for all requests using bearer token authentication in the
    Authorization header. API keys are created by team owners in the Parsec for Teams
    dashboard and must be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` over HTTPS. All
    requests require authentication.'
  - API keys are used for authentication and must be explicitly granted permissions
    for specific endpoints by team owners. Each endpoint requires a corresponding
    permission assigned to the API key. API keys should be kept secret to prevent
    unauthorized access to team resources.
  - Authorization header is required to access this endpoint. The documentation does
    not specify the exact format, scheme, or how to obtain the authorization token.
  - Authorization header is required to access this endpoint. The documentation indicates
    "Authorization" as the required authorization scheme but does not specify the
    exact format, token type, or how to obtain credentials.
  - Authorization header is required to access this endpoint. The specific auth scheme
    and credential format are not detailed in the provided documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://parsec.app/docs/teams-api:
  - For requests with multiple resources, the `data` field is an array with `count`
    indicating total resources. Use `offset` and `limit` query parameters to paginate
    through results. Stop when the number of returned resources is less than the `limit`
    value.
  - Offset-limit pagination is used for team member invites. Request parameters are
    offset (integer, >= 0, required) and limit (integer, 1-200, required) in the query
    string. The response structure for paginated results is not shown in the provided
    documentation.
  - Paginated list of team members is requested using query parameter page (optional,
    defaults to 1). Response includes page and total fields indicating current page
    number and total count of members. Construct next request by incrementing page
    value until page exceeds total pages.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset (integer, >= 0) specifies
    results to skip, and limit (integer, 1-200) specifies results per page. Construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing offset by the previous limit value.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset (integer, >= 0) specifies
    results to skip, and limit (integer, 1-200) specifies results to return per request.
    Both parameters are required. Response contains a data array with guest access
    invites.
