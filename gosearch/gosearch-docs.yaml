auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gosearch.ai/:
  - API requests require Bearer token authentication. Pass your access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {token}". In Postman, you can store the token
    in an environment variable named "token" and reference it as {{token}}.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Include your access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with all requests. Invalid or deactivated
    tokens will return a 401 Unauthorized error.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gosearch.ai/:
  - All list endpoints return a metadata object with pagination information. Use limit
    (number of results per page, default 10) and offset (starting position) query
    parameters to control pagination. The response metadata indicates total count
    and current page position to determine when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters with defaults of 10 results
    and 0 offset respectively, with limit ranging from 1 to 100. The metadata object
    in responses includes limit, offset, count, total_results, and links.next/links.prev
    fields; use the URL in links.next to fetch subsequent pages, stopping when links.next
    is null.
