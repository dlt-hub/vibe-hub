notes:
- Topic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.
- The forum is driven by community participation.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Timex’s `from_now` gives the relative duration from now.
- The `x seconds ago` would count up every second.
- When you want a generated context to target a different repo, the flag you’re looking
  for is --context-app.
- Titles are sortable
- The option_date field is not showing in the browser.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Votes are public.
- Overuse of a single attribute makes markup terribly long, hard to read and maintain
- We are not allowed to name a button like a button, but there is no problem with
  Tailwind naming - it’s using class names too! None of them are prefixed or protected
  in any way!
- Tailwind does not have one. It only replaces CSS variables with classes and requires
  from you to design everything - there is even no real solution here ...
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- File.stat gives ctime as the last time the file or the inode was changed.
- Using stat via bash gives the correct creation time via the Birth field.
- The union member 'member3' is causing a compile error related to Absinthe.
- The docs say it should be possible to import from node_modules but they aren’t perfectly
  clear on which folder is meant there.
- Inlines bindings into the query for easier debugging
- Highlights database time for slow queries
- Uses schema indices manually for backward compatibility
- Higher memory usage during encoding
- This project is the community edition of Mishka Chelekom, integrated with its dedicated
  CLI tool
- We recommend to install last version
- Excited to announce Mishka Chelekom v0.0.4 is out! Now with ComboBox support and
  tons of updates.
- For jsonb value comparisons, use fragment instead of direct syntax.
- For is_nil() on jsonb properties, ensure proper casting is applied.
- View modules are not recompiled after compiling error of unmatched tag in template
  files
- Helix is an early-stage project in active development. Current functionality is
  limited, with workflows stored in localStorage. It is not yet feature-complete.
- Currently, workflows are for planning and design only (not executable yet).
- Camera Module 3 seems to be using imx708, which is already present in nerves_system_rpi5
  in the way you added imx296 in the linked PR.
- The Entry resource doesn’t have a direct belongs_to with Tag — it only has a many_to_many
  through EntryTag.
- Since there is no build in support for Elixir into ELK
- This book is being updated every week until the full envisioned scope is realized.
- The book provides hands-on mentorship in Elixir and database modeling.
- Includes R&D and business experience insights.
- Tokens are not necessarily JWTs. It is the token resource that we use to store api
  keys.
- The favicon is not updated despite being set in the embedded config.
- 'There are some options: if you are using upserts, you can check if inserted_at
  == updated_at and do your conditional logic in that case (meaning the thing wasn’t
  there and you just created it).'
- You can have a before action hook that looks if the record is there, and if it is
  you can use Ash.Changeset.set_result to pre-empt the data layer logic.
- You can write a manual handler for the create action with manual ....
- I wouldn’t be too worried about doing the extra insert even if you don’t need it,
  and I’d personally choose the first option.
- Databases are hard!
- Unable to handle Date (a struct)
- It defaults and wants to use an api_key but I’m only using bearer auth for this
  application.
- Setup takes just a few minutes and comes with great defaults.
- AppSignal offers a 30-day free trial, no credit card is required. All features are
  available in all plans.
- 'Unlimited team members: Add as many viewers as you want. See team member''s usage
  and manage admin, billing, and invite permissions.'
- 'Share, discuss, and annotate: Share projects to collaborate and discuss. Add annotations
  to patents to keep track of work and build a valuable knowledge base.'
- 'Security and privacy controls: Share projects with your entire team or only specific
  people. Control view, edit, and sharing permissions.'
- 'Download and upload patents: You can manually add patents one-at-time or in bulk
  to projects. Easily download top search results and export work you''ve done.'
- 'Intuitive and powerful AI ranking: Powerful, flexible, and transparent. Choose
  from two ranking modes to quickly find relevant results without queries.'
- 'Robust search and filter features: You can search and highlight keywords, add wildcards
  or boolean logic, and filter on just about anything.'
- 'Project workflows: Guided workflows for core activities like invention disclosures,
  invalidity, and monitors.'
- 'Over 140m patents updated weekly: Global patent data including English machine
  translations for complete coverage. Family, citation, and legal status data too.'
- Consider using the WooCommerce REST API to query products.
- Cache queries using Cachex or Nebulex if necessary.
- 'Solved, looks like I was missing: config :myapp, MyAppWeb.Endpoint, pub_sub: MyApp.PubSub'
- Manually adding the dependencies on the runner image in my Dockerfile
- If using an environment that doesn't automatically reap zombie processes, it is
  advised to add an init process such as tini via `apt-get install` above and adding
  an entrypoint.
- 'The LiveView is mounted twice: once without a websocket and once with a websocket.'
- Conn assigns and socket assigns are independent.
- Layout was forced before the page was fully loaded. If stylesheets are not yet loaded
  this may cause a flash of unstyled content.
- 'The only way to workaround this issue that I found was to add this to my body element:
  <body class="!opacity-100" style="opacity: 0;">'
- Aliases always get prefixed with :"Elixir." if left out
- Ensure that the path passed to File functions is not user-controlled.
- 'Just as an update: I have marked out the above code as false positive via comment
  and used --skip option to skip false positives'
- Long story short, huge domain name, non erlang users. Want to shrink down the width
  of the prompt as it’s making it difficult for users to enter commands and I’m trying
  to make the experience as pleasant as possible for them.
- Community-driven forum for Elixir programming language discussions.
- The URL is derived from the current test server instance
- 'TestServer always sets up an ExUnit on_exit callback that checks routes: if anything
  is left unvisited it errors out.'
- Invalid date
- Errata promotes a consistent and structured approach to error handling.
- Errata provides support for defining custom structured error types.
- Support for add all processes from config or by runtime.
- This library helps you generate a Postman collection from your Phoenix router.
- This initial version only debounces GET requests.
- Provides a flexible, unified schema format that can be converted to provider-specific
  JSON schemas.
- Compatible with Elixir LangChain, allowing seamless integration without extensive
  modification.
- Due to the way some properties are calculated, the package can only be used with
  projected coordinate systems.
- Calculating properties on an ellipsoid requires different methods.
- Using HTTP range header to download files in chunks may lead to corrupted data if
  not handled correctly.
- Files are downloaded in chunks to avoid timeout issues.
- Ensure to handle UTF-8 encoding properly when combining chunks.
- Bumblebee supports speech to text (whisper), but unfortunately not text to speech
  (at least not yet).
- TTS models have been getting pretty good and pretty small.
- The issue was that this request required Basic Auth, which must be Base64 encoded.
- 'Problem is that I either get this error: Postgrex expected a binary of 16 bytes,
  got ''83b59a3a-e631-4416-9fec-53cc0c149d3d'''
- (Ecto.ChangeError) value `<<131, 181, 154, 58, 230, 49, 68, 22, 159, 236, 83, 204,
  12, 20, 157, 61>>` for `Redfrost.Models.Damage.aggregate_id` in `insert_all` does
  not match type :binary_id
- It seems like my model and my schema are not aligned but I do not know how to remedy
  it.
- Supervisors manage the life of children in the sense that they get them started
  and they can restart them to known good states, but they aren’t data coordinators.
- If you want essentially a multiprocess data transformation pipeline check out Flow,
  Broadway, or Oban.
- Base.encode16 and Base.decode16 require padding strings with leading 0's to force
  even character counts.
- Community-driven forum focused on Elixir programming language
- The get_environment function always returns 'Devs', which indicates that the ENVIRONMENT
  environment variable is not being read correctly from the container.
- ProxyConf is still a work in progress
- Documentation is still pretty low
- This is experimental
- Bardo has some issues, so I would hold from trying it until I merge in some changes.
- Using NX is on my todo list.
- Does not require adding any custom plugs or changing your app’s supervision trees.
- Focus will be on classical scientific computing.
- Some functions are currently only vectorized in the first argument.
- The main limitation of ndarray is that it seems like it currently can’t work on
  arrays larger than the available RAM memory.
- It’s not obvious what the use of 4D+ arrays is, 2D and 3D arrays have a natural
  real-world usage when encoding gridded data in the real world.
- Uses --info=progress2 reporting mode for rsync
- This is an early stage library. I’ve not yet used it in prod.
- This is an unofficial client library.
- Vancouver handles initialization, request validation, and offers helper functions
  to simplify the creation of MCP tools and prompts.
- Supports prompts and tools
- Authorization is out of scope for Vancouver
- You can incorporate a checkout API for payments into your application.
- The JSON spec (RFC 8259) defines the JSON key-value pairs as being unordered.
- LiveView is suitable for quick prototyping by a solo developer.
- Researching, I see that the --no-html is incompatible with live reload, which is
  a bit of a bummer, but I get it.
- It's definitely a style choice, but judicious use of mutually exclusive attributes
  can be ok.
- 'You may only set one of: [:attr1, :attr2, :attr3]'
- Uses Tailwind CSS version 4.1.10
- Regions lookup must be passed as an attribute to the form.
- Registration, changing passwords, using Facebook or Apple to sign in / up, can all
  be handled by Firebase.
- LiveView behavior may cause input value not to reflect updates in assigns.
- 'Root Cause: Missing Demand Due to Hidden Recursive Call'
- The process got stuck in an infinite loop.
- It never returned control to receive incoming demands.
- Connection details should be encrypted to avoid plain text storage.
- Group users must have access to decrypt connection details.
- Tests should focus on business logic rather than library/framework code.
- Livebook is recommended for classroom setups
- phoenix_playground package can be used to start a Phoenix server
- Repo.transaction is not happy if you mix contexts within the transaction
- You can’t specify an order for your queryable, dirty_stream relies on being able
  to sort by id
- Nesting is not required for tests, and Elixir's module nesting is an illusion.
- It seems we are not supposed to drop dbs in prod, perhaps db configs are discarded
  between different product versions.
- If an unauthenticated user is trying to navigate to a LiveView that requires authentication,
  redirect to login.
- After logging in, the user is redirected back to the page they wanted to access.
- If the user is authenticated but not authorized, redirect to home and show a flash
  message.
- Uses OAuth2 for user authentication
- Use Duffel API for managing flights and accommodations.
- Clients connect with workspace_id and agent_id as query params.

- PubSub to Channel subscribers on other nodes
- LiveView provides a way to render HTML templates on the server and keep a client
  in sync with those.
- LiveView's change tracking works best for small assigns.
- When using lists or nested data structures, LiveView does not change-track lists.
- Streams provide a way to keep items rendered on the client without server memory
  usage.
- LiveComponents encapsulate components that handle their own events.
- This is a memory optimization to not keep all children in memory
- This forum is driven by the community.
- The more you participate here, the more trust you’ll earn and the more mod-type
  tools you’ll unlock.
- API is rate limited, and returns a 429 response with a `Retry-After` header.
- Rate limit is 240 requests per minute; requests exceeding this limit will receive
  a 429 status code.
- Syncing a full catalog may exceed rate limits, requiring a wait for the `Retry-After`
  time.
- Forum driven by community participation.
- Using Ecto.Changeset for validations
- Custom messages can be applied for cast/4 validations
- Ecto.Changeset.cast/4 does not allow custom error messages.
- Community-driven platform for Elixir discussions
- Focus on learning and sharing knowledge
- The body is already decoded in params so just pattern match on the shapes that you
  recognize to process it.
- Application.ensure_all_started(:goth) should not be needed if you add goth to your
  deps

- setDomStorageEnabled seems to be needed
- Looking for a reliable and easy to implement PostgreSQL sharding solution.
- 100ms is a lot, especially if there are many requests on a page
- The 100ms delay is always there, even when there are no file changes.
- Large projects will take a bit longer.
- Provided they are in the same cluster, they can probably publish messages in the
  format Phoenix PubSub expects.
- Responses are being sent, but without gzip compression.
- To get responses to be sent with gzip compression, set the content-encoding to gzip
  and compress the responses manually.
- If chunked response is not sent, it gets compressed.
- Different kinds of auth tokens in different parts of a system
- Sometimes XML, sometimes JSON responses
- This is not a complete project and please don’t use it in production yet.
- Main constraint is to not have room overcrowded with a limit of 70 users.
- Redis is designed to handle what you're trying to do in a way that ETS and Genservers
  are not.
- You can render live components inside a playground liveview for testing as long
  as your components are fully functional, meaning no side-effects.
