auth_info:
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/docs/getting-your-access-token:
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Include your access token in the Authorization
    HTTP header as "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN". Access tokens are generated
    via the API dashboard or programmatically through a dedicated REST endpoint and
    must be copied immediately upon creation as they cannot be retrieved later.'
  - The Ironclad Clickwrap REST API requires an access token passed as an HTTP authorization
    header with every request. The access token is generated from your User Profile
    and must be included in the Authorization header of each API call.
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/docs/retrieve-last-terms-signed-by-signer:
  - 'The API uses query parameters for authentication: sid (SITE_ACCESS_ID) and sig
    (ENCODED_SIGNER_ID) must be passed as query parameters in the GET request to the
    /retrieve endpoint. These credentials identify the site and signer making the
    request.'
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/docs/integrating-pactsafe-with-zapier:
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer " + access_token when making requests to the API endpoint (e.g.,
    GET https://api.pactsafe.com/v1.1/requests/{request_id}). The access token must
    be obtained separately as documented in the "Getting your Access Token" section.
- ? information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/page/integrating-pactsafe-with-your-web-content-management-system
  : - Ironclad Clickwrap REST API requires OAuth 2.0 authentication. To access the
      API, you must obtain an access token (which requires admin access to Ironclad
      Clickwrap with REST API enabled) and include it in requests to endpoints like
      GET https://api.pactsafe.com/v1.1/versions/:version_id. The exact header name
      and token format are not specified in this excerpt; refer to the access token
      generation documentation for implementation details.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/get_locations:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number, defaults to 1) and per_page
    (results per page). Response includes page, per_page, total_count, count, has_more
    fields, and data array containing results. Use has_more to determine if additional
    pages exist.
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/get_locations-id-snapshots:
  - Use page (integer, query parameter, defaults to 1) and per_page (integer, query
    parameter) to paginate results. Response includes page, per_page, total_count,
    count, has_more (boolean), and data array; stop when has_more is false.
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/retrieve-user-memberships-for-an-account-1:
  - Page-based pagination is used with query parameters page (integer, defaults to
    1) and per_page (integer) to control which results are returned. The response
    includes count and has_more fields to indicate pagination state.
  - 'Response includes pagination fields: count (integer), has_more (boolean), page
    (integer), per_page (integer), and total_count (integer). Request parameters for
    pagination are not explicitly documented in this excerpt, so pagination control
    method is unclear.'
- information_source; https://clickwrap-developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/get_sites-site-id-signers-id-signer-id-activity:
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with the following parameters in the response:
    count (number of items returned), has_more (boolean indicating if more pages exist),
    page (current page number), per_page (items per page), and total_count (total
    number of items). Use the page parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve additional
    pages, and stop when has_more is false.'
