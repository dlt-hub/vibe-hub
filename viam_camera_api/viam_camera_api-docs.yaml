auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.viam.com/operate/control/headless-app/:
  - The documentation describes storing API keys in environment variables and mentions
    using `RobotClient.Options.with_api_key()` for authentication. API keys should
    be stored as environment variables rather than hardcoded. The connection requires
    an API key and API key ID, which are obtained from the machine's CONNECT tab in
    the Viam platform.
- information_source; https://docs.viam.com/manage/fleet/provision/setup/:
  - API key authentication is used, with credentials passed via custom HTTP headers.
    The API key ID is sent in the 'key_id' header and the API key itself is sent in
    the 'key' header. API keys are created with specific roles, resource types, and
    resource IDs to control authorization scope.
