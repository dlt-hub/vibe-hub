notes:
- Uses secret keys for authentication (sk_test_ for Test environment, sk_live_ for
  Live environment)
- Test environment invoices are not sent to SAT and have no fiscal validity
- Customers created in Test environment are not shared with Live environment
- If the invoice is created in Live environment, it will be stamped and sent to SAT
- Products created in Test environment are not shared with Live environment
- During development, you can use the Facturapi API in the Test environment, and the
  invoices you issue will not be sent to the SAT (Mexican Tax Authority) and will
  not have fiscal validity
- The secret key you use to authenticate will determine both the environment in which
  the invoice will be created (Test or Live), as well as the organization to use as
  the issuer
- Customers created in the Test environment are not shared with the Live environment
- The secret key determines both the environment (Test or Live) and the organization
  to use as the issuer
- API designed with REST standard, responses in JSON format
- Uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs
