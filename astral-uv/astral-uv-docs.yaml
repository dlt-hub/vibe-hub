notes:
- 'WARNING: `UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=true` is intended for use in continuous integration
  (CI) or containerized environments and should be used with caution, as modifying
  the system Python can lead to unexpected behavior.'
- uv may also be installed with pip, Homebrew, and more.
- uv automatically installs missing Python versions as needed — you don't need to
  install Python to get started.
- uv has specialized support for easily invoking and installing tools.
- If your project does not include a `[build-system]` definition in the `pyproject.toml`,
  uv will not build it by default.
- PyPI does not support publishing with username and password anymore, instead you
  need to generate a token.
- uv uses a dedicated virtual environment for each project in a .venv directory
- uv will prefer a .venv in the project directory and ignore the active environment
  as declared by the VIRTUAL_ENV variable by default
- Best practice to pin to a specific uv version.
- It is recommended to add .venv to a .dockerignore file.
- If you're not mounting the cache, image size can be reduced by using the --no-cache
  flag or setting UV_NO_CACHE.
- By default, managed Python installations are not cached before being installed.
- uv provides both distroless Docker images and images derived from popular base images.
- It is best practice to pin to a specific uv version.
- The cache directory's location can be determined by running the `uv cache dir` command
  in the container.
- The system Python environment is safe to use this context, since a container is
  already isolated.
- To use the system Python environment by default, set the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON variable.
- The installer requires curl (and certificates) to download the release archive.
- The `pyproject.toml` is required to identify the project root and name, but the
  project contents are not copied into the image until the final `uv sync` command.
- Best practice to separate copying the requirements from the rest of the source code.
- By default, `jupyter lab` will start the server at http://localhost:8888/lab.
- marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python scripts
- Packages installed from the marimo UI will automatically be added to the notebook's
  script metadata
- 'It is considered best practice to pin to a specific uv version, e.g., with version:
  "0.9.6"'
- If you are using a distroless image, you have to specify the entrypoint.
- Some of the features outlined in this guide require uv version 0.5.3 or later.
- Uses automatic backend selection for PyTorch index via command-line argument or
  environment variable
- uv run will automatically resolve and lock the project dependencies
- For more on using uv with Docker, see the Docker guide
- PRIVATE_REGISTRY should match the name of the index defined in your pyproject.toml.
- JFrog requires an empty username but uv passes `__token__` for as the username when
  `--token` is used.
- By default, AWS Management Console assumes a Lambda entrypoint of lambda_function.lambda_handler.
  If your application uses a different entrypoint, you'll need to modify it in the
  AWS Management Console.
- Coiled supports AWS, GCP, and Azure
- The default instance type is a 4-core virtual machine with 16 GiB of memory
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Locking is the process of resolving your project's dependencies into a lockfile.
- Syncing is the process of installing a subset of packages from the lockfile into
  the project environment.
- Projects may declare the Python versions supported by the project in the project.requires-python
  field of the pyproject.toml.
- FLASH_ATTENTION_SKIP_CUDA_BUILD environment variable ensures that flash-attn is
  installed from a compatible, pre-built wheel, rather than attempting to build it
  from source, which requires access to the CUDA development toolkit.
- Automatic Python version downloads can be disabled without changing the preference.
- Indexes are prioritized in the order in which they’re defined.
- The uv build backend currently only supports pure Python code.
- Only HTTPS Basic authentication is supported.
- The credentials will not be validated, i.e., incorrect credentials will not fail.
- uv will not persist Git credentials to the pyproject.toml or uv.lock.
- If you have a Git credential helper configured, your credentials may be automatically
  persisted.
- uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate.
- To use the platform's native certificate store, run uv with the --native-tls command-line
  flag or set the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable to true.
- If a direct path to the certificate is required, set the SSL_CERT_FILE environment
  variable to the path of the certificate bundle.
- If client certificate authentication (mTLS) is desired, set the SSL_CLIENT_CERT
  environment variable to the path of the PEM formatted file containing the certificate
  followed by the private key.
- To allow insecure connections to dedicated hosts, use the allow-insecure-host configuration
  option.
- uv uses aggressive caching to avoid re-downloading (and re-building) dependencies
  that have already been accessed in prior runs.
- To clear the cache entirely, run `uv cache clean`. To clear the cache for a specific
  package, run `uv cache clean <package-name>`.
- To force uv to revalidate cached data for all dependencies, pass `--refresh` to
  any command.
- To force uv to ignore existing installed versions, pass `--reinstall` to any installation
  command.
- It's safe to run multiple uv commands concurrently, even against the same virtual
  environment.
- uv always requires a cache directory. When `--no-cache` is requested, uv will still
  use a temporary cache for sharing data within that single invocation.
- uv includes opt-in preview features to provide an opportunity for community feedback
  and increase confidence that changes are a net-benefit before enabling them for
  everyone.
- uv requires using a virtual environment by default
- Installing into system Python across platforms and distributions is notoriously
  difficult
- uv allows dependencies to be locked in the requirements.txt format.
- It is recommended to use the standard pyproject.toml to define dependencies.
- uv is designed as a drop-in replacement for common pip and pip-tools workflows.
- uv does not read configuration files or environment variables that are specific
  to pip.
- Allow insecure connections to a host.
- Path to the cache directory.
- 'WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system''s
  certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified
  sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.'
- 'WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system''s
  certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified
  sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.'
- Change to the given directory prior to running the command.
- 'WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system''s
  certificate store.'
- Build constraints are used to restrict the versions of build dependencies that are
  selected when building a package during resolution or installation.
- In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `build-constraint-dependencies`
  from the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations
  in other workspace members or `uv.toml` files.
- 'Default value: []'
- 'Type: list[str]'
- Default value for constraint-dependencies is []
- Default value for default-groups is ["dev"]
- Default value for dependency-groups is []
- Default value for dev-dependencies is []
- Default value for environments is []
- Default value for index is []
- Default value for managed is true
- Default value for override-dependencies is []
- Default value for package is true
- Default value for required-environments is []
- By default, uv is installed to ~/.local/bin.
- If XDG_BIN_HOME is set, it will be used instead.
- Similarly, if XDG_DATA_HOME is set, the target directory will be inferred as XDG_DATA_HOME/../bin.
- Build failures can occur for many reasons, some unrelated to uv itself.
- Common build failures include missing commands, headers, or modules.
- Prevent setuptools version 72.0.0 from being used as a build dependency.
- uv requires that all dependencies have the same minimum Python version.
- uv ignores upper-bounds on requires-python.
- uv has Tier 1 support for macOS (Apple Silicon), macOS (x86_64), Linux (x86_64),
  Windows (x86_64)
- uv has Tier 2 support for Linux (PPC64), Linux (PPC64LE), Linux (RISC-V64), Linux
  (aarch64), Linux (armv7), Linux (i686), Linux (s390x), Windows (arm64)
- uv supports macOS 13+ (Ventura)
- uv supports and is tested against Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13,
  3.14
