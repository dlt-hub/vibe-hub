notes:
- The primary task of the sync server is to sync your budget between devices, and
  to enable bank syncing.
- We are dropping support for Node versions older than 22 in this release.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Starting this release, the actual-server repository will no longer be updated. If
  you use a local install, please review these docs for how to migrate.
- Starting next release, we plan on deprecating the @actual-app/web NPM package. This
  should not impact any standard deployment methods, but if you have a use-case for
  this package, please create an issue so we know about it!
- Experimental support for multiple users via OpenID Connect
- Add support for authentication using OpenID Connect.
- ability to favorite payees
- most used and favorite payees appear at the top of the payee autocomplete results
- resizable side navigation
- 'experimental goal templates: long term goal template support'
- 'experimental spending report: adding last month as an option for the primary graph'
- 'API: ability to run 3rd party bank-sync (GoCardless, SimpleFin) programmatically'
- 'API: methods for working with rules'
- Add option to authenticate with HTTP header - X-ACTUAL-PASSWORD
- Add option to import CAMT.053 based XML files
- (Experimental) monthly spending report - please report feedback
- Ability to show/hide reconciled transactions
- Ability to prepend/append notes when bulk editing transactions
- Show remaining balance in the category autocomplete
- 'OFX, CSV import: ability to disable transaction de-duplication logic'
- 'Mobile: account management functionality'
- 'Mobile: clicking on category allows to see transactions list for the clicked category'
- Desktop app release
- (Experimental) custom report improvements - please report your feedback here
- This release introduces a breaking change, there is now a requirement for Actual
  to be served over HTTPS when not running on localhost.
- Uses a virtual envelope system for budgeting.
- We had to adjust the Groceries budget when we won the lottery.
- Without this, we would have had a deficit in this category.
- We used more money than was allocated for gifts.
- We spent much less on Dining Out than we allocated.
- We will also increase the Gas budget by $ 10.
- Keeping your existing transaction history is important.
- Migration from YNAB4 is officially supported.
- The API allows anyone to write a custom importer.
- End-to-end encryption allows you to encrypt the data on your remote server with
  a password.
- Resetting the Budget Cache clears all cached values and will completely re-calculate
  your entire budget.
- End-to-end encryption is optional and requires a second password to access the budget.
- Actual does not have a REST API with endpoints that you can just call.
- Developers will only need to clone/sync one repo instead of two.
- It makes end-to-end debugging for server/client easier as they will be in the same
  workspace.
- Enables the desktop app to embed the sync server.
- This integration relies on you providing your own API credentials that you will
  need to get by signing up with the service provider and Generate Keys and Secrets
  that will be used in Actual.
- The integration only works if you are using actual-server.
- The Secrets and Keys are stored in your Actual installed version so it is highly
  recommended to turn on End to End encryption and create a strong passphrase to encrypt
  your files.
- You will need to add a config file to your installation.
- The only way to print the filtered results is via a screen shot (unless you save
  to a spreadsheet as a CSV file first)
- The columns of the filtered view cannot yet be sorted. But you can of course export
  the filtered results to a spreadsheet and play with them to your heart’s content.
- Split transactions do not behave well in the filtered view. The non-applicable part
  of the filtered results can end up getting added into the total.
- Filters are just one way of searching and viewing your data. There is still great
  scope for the future development of graphical style reports in Actual.
- Rules can automate transaction processing and clean up payees.
- Actual will automatically try to avoid duplicate transactions.
- This guidance is not compatible with split transactions, bulk editing produces some
  unexpected behaviors when bulk editing split transactions.
- Client Version 23.7.0 and Server Version 23.7.0 or higher are required for this
  feature.
- From July 2025 onwards, GoCardless has stopped accepting new Bank Account Data accounts.
- Client Version 24.10.0 and Server Version 24.10.0 or higher are required for this
  feature.
- Currently, the sync pulls at most 90 days of data from each linked account.
- SimpleFIN's data updates one time / day, roughly every 24 hours, for each linked
  account.
- From July 2025 onwards, GoCardless has stopped accepting new Bank Account Data accounts.
  The below sign up instructions are now outdated, however, if you are an existing
  user, your account should continue to work.
- Item IDs are associated with user-authorized connections and will expire if access
  is revoked or the token expires.
- Use the sandbox environment for testing — test credentials are available in the
  Pluggy Docs.
- Data refresh frequency may vary by financial institution.
