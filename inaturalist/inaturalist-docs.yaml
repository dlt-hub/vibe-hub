- iNaturalist is an OAuth2 provider and supports the Authorization Code, Resource
  Owner Password Credentials, and Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) flows.
- Authentication required for pages higher than 100.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication to access data.
- API can return large datasets, pagination is necessary.
- Properly curated nodes on iNaturalist should have all of their children grafted
  beneath them.
- As a rule of thumb, not including additional nodes in iNaturalist is preferable
  to including but only partially curating additional nodes.

- The conservation status summarizes the risk of extinction for a group of organisms.
- Agnatha as traditionally defined is paraphyletic, that is, a taxon including all
  jawless fishes, but if one only includes living species then the group becomes monophyletic.
- The crown-group definition of Aves has been criticized for its stability.
- Some species are able to use chemical defences against predators
- Intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death
- Most categories of organisms have 'common names' in spoken languages. These names
  are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce, and stable over time, but many organisms
  have several different names in different places, even in the same language, which
  can make it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.
- Birds have a complex respiratory system with air sacs.

  Taeniodonta, with genus Alveugena classified as a sister taxon to this order.
