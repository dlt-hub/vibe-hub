  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with refresh token support. POST to https://connect.www.paymill.org/token
    with required parameters client_id, client_secret (set to private API key), grant_type
    (fixed to "refresh_token"), and refresh_token to obtain a new access token. Only
    one access token per authorization is valid at a time; generating a new token
    invalidates the previous one. Optional scope parameter must be a subset of originally
    requested privileges.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with scope-based permissions. Exchange authorization
    code for access token by POST to https://connect.www.paymill.org/token with client_id,
    client_secret, grant_type set to "authorization_code", and code in application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    body. Scopes are resource-based (clients, offers, payments, preauthorizations,
    refunds, subscriptions, transactions, webhooks) with read (r) and write (w) flags
    combined automatically. Response includes private api key, public api key, and
    refresh token.
