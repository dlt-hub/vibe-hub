  - 'Non-Federated users authenticate by posting username and password to POST /accounts/login,
    which returns an access_token with token_type "bearer". This Bearer token must
    then be sent in the Authorization header (format: "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>")
    for subsequent API requests.'
  - To authenticate with MuleSoft Anypoint Platform APIs, you must first obtain a
    Bearer token. For federated users, POST a SAMLResponse value (extracted from browser
    debugger tools during SSO login) to POST /accounts/login with Content-Type application/json,
    then use the returned access_token field as a Bearer token in subsequent API requests.
    For non-federated users, use username and password credentials to obtain the Bearer
    token via the same endpoint.
