notes:
- Use a service account and a driver to connect to the Firebolt API which returns
  a result.
- Firebolt is a next-generation cloud data warehouse designed for organizations that
  require lightning-fast analytics at scale.
- Firebolt supports ingesting data efficiently through ELT tools, making it easy to
  move data from data lakes, relational databases, and other source systems into Firebolt.
- Firebolt is designed specifically to address the demands of modern data workloads.
- Firebolt's platform is optimized for integration within modern data workflows.
- Firebolt Core is a free, self-hosted edition of Firebolt’s distributed query engine
  available as a project on GitHub.
- Firebolt supports both parallel and pipelined data processing.
- Defining primary indexes on all tables is encouraged.
- Disabling compression with NONE is not supported.
- Firebolt always compresses data using one of the supported algorithms.
- Firebolt supports caching of both metadata and data of Iceberg tables on local SSDs
  as well as in-memory snapshot caching of metadata.
- Always use secure AWS credentials.
- Use IAM roles instead setting credentials directly in the code for better security.
- 'No Nested Transactions: Starting a new transaction within an existing one will
  cause an error.'
- 'Transaction Lifetime: An idle or active transaction will be automatically aborted
  after 24 hours.'
- 'Number of Statement: The number of statements which can be executed in a single
  explicit transaction is limited to 100.'
- Subqueries allow complex data retrieval by enabling a query to filter results based
  on the outcome of another query.
- Subquery operators are crucial in constructing nested queries, especially within
  the WHERE clause.
- This setting overrides default load-based sharding of input files. Be cautious as
  a single partition with heavy data could overload a single shard.
- This setting is only available via the WITH SETTINGS syntax, not with SET.
- Larger target tablet sizes may require more memory during ingestion.
- Firebolt currently offers limited cross-region data transfer and will throttle requests
  if the limit is exceeded. The current limit is 100 GB per hour per node.
- Identifiers must contain at least one character, and no more than 255 characters
  total.
- Unquoted identifiers must adhere to specific syntax rules.
- Synchronous queries complete within a single request-response cycle.
- Queries running longer than one hour may experience connectivity interruptions.
- You must have access to an active Firebolt account.
- You must have access to an active Firebolt service account.
- You must associate a user with your service account.
- You must have sufficient permissions on the engine, as well as on any tables and
  databases you access.
- To submit an asynchronous query via a raw HTTP request, you must use Firebolt protocol
  version 2.3 or later.
- You can load data into Firebolt from an Amazon S3 bucket using two different workflows.
- You can load data in CSV, Parquet, TSV, AVRO, JSON Lines or ORC formats.
- Each service account requires a secret to access Firebolt programmatically.
- Organization names are globally unique — no two organizations can have the same
  name.
- Firebolt does not support usernames with personal email addresses, such as `me@gmail.com`
  or `you@outlook.com`.
- There can be up to 20 accounts per organization and you can use CREATE ACCOUNT 25
  times.
- Managing logins requires the org_admin role.
- Users authenticate via logins or service accounts.
- Managing roles requires the account_admin role.
- Create a login if you want to associate a user with human access to Firebolt.
- A user must have organization administrative privileges to manage logins and service
  accounts.
- Invoices for Firebolt engines and data are submitted through the AWS Marketplace.
- Your account should now be associated with AWS Marketplace.
- A service account is required to access the API.
- New accounts receive credits ($200) to get started exploring Firebolt’s capabilities.
- 'Each FBU is related to the amount of time as follows: Ingest initial data: 4-16
  FBU; Run test queries: 8-32 FBU; Find optimal query performance: 32-240 FBU; Find
  optimal test integrations: 32-240 FBU.'
- Data is stored in units of data storage called tablets.
- Managing network policies requires the org_admin role.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to manage user permissions by controlling
  who can access or perform operations on specific objects in Firebolt.
- LOCATION objects are secure, reusable objects that store connection details and
  credentials for external data sources.
- LOCATION objects eliminate the need to repeatedly specify credentials across SQL
  scripts, making your data workflows more secure, maintainable, and scalable.
- Enabling MFA for a login requires the org_admin role.
- Ownership transfer using the Firebolt Workspace is not available for Schema, Table,
  and View objects.
- AWS PrivateLink for Firebolt is in public preview and available in all Firebolt
  regions.
- Your security group should allow inbound traffic on port 443 in order to interact
  with the Firebolt API.
- Ensure you have a Firebolt account and a Firebolt database.
- Client ID and secret are obtained by registering a service account.
- The Firebolt Airflow provider package currently supports Apache Airflow 2.x only.
- Task will not fail if query times out, and will proceed to the next task
- Firebolt JDBC driver required for connections
- Ensure IAM permissions are in place for AWS Glue jobs
- A workspace is an organizational unit, accessible by team members, that is created
  for a specific purpose.
- Contact Firebolt Support to enable Looker Cloud connectivity.
- Upload only the public key to Firebolt. Do not share the private key.
- Service account must have necessary permissions and the ID/secret must be correct.
- Firebolt does not support Tableau Cloud.
- Once you have set up a connection to Firebolt, you cannot change the database that
  you specified during setup.
- Active Firebolt account is required
- Service account must be associated with a user with USAGE and SELECT permissions
- This integration is compatible with LangChain 0.1.0 and later versions.
- Consider using appropriate filters and limits in your natural language prompts to
  optimize query performance.
- Uses SQLAlchemy for connection to Firebolt.
- Credentials should be stored as environment variables.
- Pandas 2.2+ is only compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- Create access credentials in AWS to load data from S3 into Firebolt.
- The Rust SDK does not currently support streaming queries for processing large result
  sets.
- A service account, which is used for programmatic access to Firebolt, uses a client_id
  and a client_secret for identification.
- The Firebolt .NET SDK is designed to facilitate integration with Firebolt’s database
  capabilities.
- Must have access to an active Firebolt service account
- User should have USAGE permission to query your database
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- 'Connection loss: The HTTP connection is interrupted.'
- 'Engine does not exist or you don’t have permission to access it: Ensure the user
  has USAGE permission on the engine.'
- 'Protocol version mismatch: Using an outdated Firebolt protocol version.'
- 'Query failure: The query encounters an execution error.'
- 'Token not found: The provided async query token is invalid or expired.'
- 'Engine does not exist or you don’t have permission to access it: The specified
  Firebolt engine is not running or you don’t have permission to access it.'
- You can’t delete a service account if it is linked to users.
- '401 Unauthorized: User will receive this response if a network policy does not
  allow access.'
