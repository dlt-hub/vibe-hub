auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.simplyrets.com/api/index.html:
  - SimplyRETS API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Provide your API credentials (username
    and password) in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme, or use the demo
    credentials simplyrets/simplyrets for testing purposes.
- information_source; https://docs.simplyrets.com/topics/pagination-with-lastId:
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Use the username and password "simplyrets:simplyrets"
    sent via HTTP Basic Auth (the `-u` flag in curl, or the `Authorization: Basic`
    header in Python). Send requests to the API endpoint with these credentials included
    in every request.'
  - The SimplyRETS API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed in the
    Authorization header using the format "username:password" encoded in base64. For
    example, use the username "simplyrets" and password "simplyrets" with the -u flag
    in curl or set the Authorization header to "Basic" followed by the base64-encoded
    credentials.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.simplyrets.com/topics/pagination-with-lastId:
  - Pagination uses limit and lastId query parameters. The limit parameter (optional,
    max 500, default appears to be 10) controls page size. The lastId parameter (optional,
    default 0) specifies the starting point; extract the mlsId from the last listing
    in the response and use it as lastId in the next request to fetch subsequent pages.
    Stop when fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (optional, default 10) and lastId (optional,
    default 0) to request pages. The response includes Link header with rel="next"
    and rel="prev" containing pre-built URLs for navigation, plus X-Total-Count header
    showing total results. Stop paginating when no rel="next" link is returned.
