notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with Google or Github — requires account setup
- To generate audio you will need an active API key accessible and an active subscription.
- Rime’s mistv2 and mist models are faster than v1 models (deprecated in February
  2025).
- Using the noTextNormalization parameter can reduce computation needed for TTS inference.
- Once you create a team, there is currently no way to undo this action.
- Rime users can only be a member of one team at a time.
- Rime handles API authentication via the key you provide
- Ensure the NVIDIA GPU Operator is installed correctly in your cluster.
- Once the containers are started, expect 5 minutes delay for warm up before sending
  first tts requests.
- Scrape metrics every 5 seconds
- Default path for Prometheus metrics is /metrics
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or token'
