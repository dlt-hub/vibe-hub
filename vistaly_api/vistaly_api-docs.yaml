- Vistaly supports required custom fields of types text and numeric. However, if your
  Jira workflow enforces other custom attribute types on creation, please use the
  'link workflow' until additional field types are supported.

  default to the time we receive the API call.

  extra care
- User tokens will expire if the authorizing user changes their password
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
