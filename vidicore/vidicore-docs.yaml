auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/rest.html:
  - The RunAs header is used for authentication. This header allows a user to execute
    requests on behalf of another user (Run-As option). Exact header name is RunAs.
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/storage/storage.html:
  - Credentials are embedded in storage method URLs (username and password in FTP/Azure
    URLs). Passwords are encrypted and cannot be viewed through API/server logs. When
    requesting file URLs with methodType=AUTO, a no-auth URL is generated instead.
  - Credentials are stored write-only in the VidiCore database via the API secret
    endpoint. Credentials like username and password are created using PUT requests
    to paths like /secret/{secret-id}/{field-name}, then referenced in storage URIs
    (e.g., ftp://export-ftp-credentials@ftp-server/export/) where the secret ID acts
    as the credential identifier.
  - Storage credentials can be specified directly in storage URIs (e.g., `ftp://testuser:testpassword@ftp.example.com/`)
    or referenced by alias from a credentials storage (e.g., `ftp://exampleftp@ftp.example.com/`).
    Credentials are stored in a Java Keystore or similar credential storage system.
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/storage/auto-import.html:
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Credentials are sent via HTTP Basic Auth using
    the format `-uusername:password` in requests, where the username and password
    are base64-encoded in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/ref/item/item.html:
  - Use `offset` (integer, default 1) to specify the starting position and `number`
    (integer, default 100) to specify how many entities to fetch per request. The
    response includes a hits field indicating total results; continue paginating by
    incrementing the offset parameter until all results are retrieved.
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/ref/metadata/document-metadata.html:
  - The endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameters first (starting
    position, default 1) and number (limit, default all). The Link response header
    contains URLs for previous, next, first, and last pages.
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/ref/metadata/metadata.html:
  - The API uses Link header-based pagination with rel values for previous, next,
    first, and last page URLs. No explicit query parameters for pagination are documented
    in this section.
- information_source; https://apidoc.vidispine.com/25.2.0/ref/search/search.html:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based and cursor-based methods. Request parameters: first
    (integer, default 1, specifies starting offset) and cursor (string, optional,
    use * for initial request or pass cursor string from previous search results).
    Response includes cursor string for subsequent requests.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters first (integer, default 1, specifies starting
    offset) and number (integer, default 100, specifies count of entities to fetch).
    The response includes hits when count is true (default).
