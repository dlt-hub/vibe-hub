auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.business.untappd.com/:
  - API authentication uses Basic Authorization header with credentials obtained via
    POST request. Send a POST to the sessions endpoint with JSON body containing email
    and password fields to receive auth_token and auth_token_read_only. Supply either
    token with every request using the Authorization header in Basic access authentication
    format. The API key is lazily created on first call and persists; call DELETE
    on the sessions endpoint to invalidate the current key and create a new one.
  - 'Authorization header using Basic authentication scheme. The credentials are base64-encoded
    username and password in the format "username:password". Send as Authorization:
    Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>.'
  - 'Authorization uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header with the format "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
    For example, the header value is "Authorization: Basic bmlja0BuZXh0Z2xhc3MuY286eUN3Q2l4YWdvdzFMbXctdE5jajc="
    where the base64 part decodes to username:password.'
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as an Authorization header
    using the format "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
    Example: Authorization: Basic bmlja0BuZXh0Z2xhc3MuY286eUN3Q2l4YWdvdzFMbXctdE5jajc='
  - 'Basic authentication is required for updating menus. Send credentials in the
    Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Basic" followed by a base64-encoded
    string of "username:password".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.business.untappd.com/:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (integer, optional) with 14 results per
    page. Navigation is provided via RFC-5988 Link headers in the response.
  - The GET endpoint for retrieving toasts uses offset-based pagination. The offset
    parameter (optional, integer) specifies the starting index for the next page,
    with 25 toasts per page.
  - The max_id parameter (optional, integer) is used for pagination. Pass the max_id
    value from the previous response to fetch the next 25 checkins. Continue paginating
    until fewer than 25 results are returned.
