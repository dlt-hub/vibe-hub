notes:
- Text API is an alternate method of manipulating Vehicle Spy.
- Major automotive manufacturers and suppliers use Vehicle Spy to help them test,
  develop, validate, and diagnose their in-vehicle networks.
- Some Ethernet features are not supported with this version of Windows, but the software
  is otherwise compatible
- Windows RT is not supported by Vehicle Spy
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Entering a logon name creates a Data Directory folder of the same name within the
  Vehicle Spy Data Directory.
- To remove a user, the user Data Directory must be deleted.
- When Vehicle Spy opens, it creates a new setup by default.
- Changing the name of a .vs3zip file outside of Vehicle Spy will cause database problems.
- Function blocks can be imported and exported as .vs3fb files.
- Graphical panels can be imported and exported as .vs3gp files.
- Entering a logon name creates a Data Directory folder within the Vehicle Spy Data
  Directory.
- If there are problems starting Vehicle Spy, the cause of the problem will most likely
  be the hardware. Hardware problems can occur because hardware is either not connected
  or properly configured.
- Vehicle Spy must be offline to delete a block.
- Function blocks can be controlled and monitored from the Function Block List.
- Automatically restart when complete is the default for Script Type Function Blocks.
- You must have Visual C++ installed. Currently, Visual Studio 2005 and later (including
  the latest and upcoming releases) are supported.
- The C Code Interface fully supports the CAN protocol.
- There is partial support for all protocols when working at the signal level.
- The main difference is that working at the bit and byte level of the other Vehicle
  Spy protocols is not supported.
- Scripts loop automatically by default; when the last step is executed, the script
  will begin running again.
- If this behavior is not desired, a script can be terminated using the Stop command.
- A toolbar at the top of the setup area for script type function blocks allows you
  to work with steps as you develop your script program.
- This region is also where Vehicle Spy warns you in real time of any errors that
  it may currently see with the script as it has been defined thus far.
- Each message has an associated Present flag.
- The Present flag is set to False (0) when Vehicle Spy starts.
- Using Clear Stats in this manner resets not only the Present flag, but also all
  other information related to the message, including its data.
- If you will need to work with other properties or data in the message, it is recommended
  that you instead use Set Value.
- Capture type function blocks allow the ability to catch data as it comes over the
  network and save it to a buffer file for future analysis.
- Playback blocks allow you to transmit messages in a Vehicle Spy buffer file based
  on timestamps.
- Playback blocks are simpler than script or capture type function blocks.
- Buffers are stored in the standard .csv text format and can be edited in a text
  editor or using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
- Be sure when modifying the data not to alter the basic structure of the file or
  remove any of header lines, such as those containing network, protocol and baud
  rate information.
- One example of customization would be changing the data file to alter message timing.
- Each logical control structure must begin with an If command.
- The Else command has no Value parameters.
- Multiple Else If commands can be used.
- VSpy 3 Documentation
- Some hardware devices support loading CoreMini Scripts over CAN.
- The default settings are recommended for best performance.
- Extracts data from standalone logger SD cards and exports to various file formats.
- None of these file converters will change the original file. All of these converters
  work with a copy of the original file and leave the original untouched.
- Vehicle Spy allows simulation of hardware by reading a data file and playing it
  back into Vehicle Spy as if it was coming directly from the hardware.
- neoVI has six general purpose 3.3 VDC IO pins.
- Outputs are capable of LED drive through a current limiting resistor.
- Maximum current of all outputs should not exceed 5 mA.
- Each IO pin has a series 47 ohm resistor and a transient protection device.
- neoVI RED 2 combines the best of vehicle network interfaces with the Linux-embedded
  operating system.
- The neoVI RED 2 Series has up to eight dual wire CAN FD channels, two LIN channels,
  and two Gigabit Ethernet channels.
- All neoVI Blue setup is done through the neoVI Explorer.
- The ValueCAN 4 series offers CAN FD support, increased buffer size, improved latency
  performance.
