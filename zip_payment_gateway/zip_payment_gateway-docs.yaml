auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.us.zip.co/docs/api-implementation:
  - All operations require HMAC-SHA256 signatures using a shared secret key provided
    by Zip. For POST JSON requests, sign the entire request body. For POST Form and
    GET requests, sign all keys and values in alphabetical order excluding the signature
    itself. The signature is sent via the X-QP-Signature header or query parameter
    as a Base64-encoded string.
  - The authentication mechanism uses a Merchant ID provided by Zip. Include the merchantId
    field in the POST request body to the /orders/authorize endpoint; this serves
    as your merchant credential for identifying your account with Zip.
  - Use HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Exclude the X-QP-Signature parameter
    from the cryptographic hash, sort all remaining query parameters or form data
    alphabetically by key name, concatenate the sorted keys and values without separators,
    and generate the signature using the merchant's API secret via HMAC-SHA256. The
    X-QP-Signature parameter is then included in the request for validation.
- information_source; https://docs.us.zip.co/reference/overview:
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Retrieve the API key from configuration
    key 'ZipAPIKey' and add it to the Authorization header as "Bearer {apiKey}". For
    idempotent requests, include an additional Idempotency-Key header with a unique
    value (V4 UUID recommended) on POST requests.
  - The Zip API uses a secure API key for authentication to identify and authorize
    merchants. API keys are provided upon registration and must be kept secure, though
    the documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or method
    for transmitting the key in requests.
