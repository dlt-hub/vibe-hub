notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires Google Cloud project with Sheets API enabled.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The current SOAP to REST generation has some limitations.
- All the generated REST services are not production-ready and require manual review
  and necessary edits using MI for VS Code.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Environment Variables granted the highest precedence for configuration.
- System Properties set at the JVM level are the second-highest in precedence.
- File Properties have the lowest precedence and usually contain default settings.
- Utilizing externalized configuration in Synapse artifacts allows these components
  to automatically adapt to different environments.
- While Synapse artifacts continue to support the $FILE and $SYSTEM sources, it is
  now recommended to use ${configs.<parameter_name>} for managing configurations.
- Requires Google Cloud project setup and API key.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires OAuth2 setup with Google Cloud Console
- 'You need Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the WSO2 Integrator: MI for VS Code
  extension installed.'
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21 is required.
- CORS is enabled for the management API by default.
- Rate limits apply per user and per application.
- Certain endpoints may require elevated access.
- The basic auth handler is engaged in the API for authentication.
- Credentials must be provided in the Authorization header.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Salesforce
- 'Requires setup of connected app in WSO2 Integrator: MI'
- 'Ensure that WSO2 Integrator: MI is started.'
- Make sure the MI CLI is downloaded and initialized.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in WSO2 Integrator
- Secret encryption supports only JKS Key Stores.
- The HashiCorp secret ID is only applicable when AppRole Pull authentication is used.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 client in WSO2
- Limited support for some message types
- Requires Google Cloud project setup with API access enabled
- May return rate limit errors if requests exceed quota
- When there are replicas in the deployment, the write operations will not work properly.
- Requires Google API credentials
- Ensure the necessary scopes are enabled for the service account
- The management API is secured using JWT authentication by default.
- When the default JWT security handler is engaged, all resources except `/login`
  are protected by JWT auth.
- Only admin users can add or delete properties from a registry resource.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of Twitter Developer account
- Rate limits apply to API calls
