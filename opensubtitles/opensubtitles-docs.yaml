auth_info:
- information_source; https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api/73acf79accc0a-login:
  - The login endpoint uses API Key authentication. Send a POST request to https://api.opensubtitles.com/api/v1/login
    with Content-Type header set to application/json and a User-Agent header in the
    format <<{{APP_NAME}} v{{APP_VERSION}}>>. The response returns a JWT token that
    must be included in subsequent requests, particularly when using the vip-api.opensubtitles.com
    base_url. Rate limit is 1 request per 1 second for login; if you receive a 401
    Unauthorized response, stop retrying with those credentials.
- information_source; https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api/e3750fd63a100-getting-started:
  - API key authentication via the Api-Key header, plus JWT token authentication via
    the Authorization header for user-specific endpoints. Set User-Agent or X-User-Agent
    header with your application name and version; Api-Key header with your API key
    value; for authenticated endpoints, obtain a JWT from the login endpoint and send
    it in the Authorization header. JWT tokens expire after 24 hours and must be refreshed
    by re-authenticating.
  - 'The API requires two authentication components: an API key passed in the Api-Key
    header, and a User Token (setup details referenced but not fully specified in
    this section). Additionally, a User-Agent header with application name and version
    is required for all requests, or X-User-Agent as an alternative if User-Agent
    cannot be set. The example shows Api-Key header format as "Api-Key: <<API_KEY>>"
    and User-Agent format as "User-Agent: <<APP_NAME v APP_VERSION>>".'
  - 'The OpenSubtitles API uses two authentication credentials sent as HTTP headers.
    The Api-Key header is required for all requests and should contain your API key.
    The Authorization header with a Bearer token is required after user authorization
    and should contain your access token. Both headers must be present in every request:
    Api-Key: <<API_KEY>> and Authorization: Bearer <<ACCESS_TOKEN>>. Additionally,
    a User-Agent header identifying your application is required.'
  - 'The OpenSubtitles API uses two authentication mechanisms: a static API key for
    applications sent via the "Api-Key" HTTP header, and a JWT token for users sent
    via the "Authorization" HTTP header. One API key per application is mandatory.'
