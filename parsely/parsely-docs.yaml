notes:
- The API’s numbers will not match exactly the numbers in our dashboard.
- If you receive an empty response, check spelling, capitalization, or filters.
- Ensure proper OAuth2 setup for authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Parse.ly
- All Parse.ly accounts are eligible for Parse.ly Sage; it just needs to be requested.
- Reports are available in HTML, PDF, XLSX, or CSV formats.
- Reports available in HTML, PDF, XLSX, and CSV formats.
- For alerts in mobile browsers to work, the browser doesn’t need to remain open,
  but it does need to be running in the background.
- On Android phones, the browser doesn’t automatically start after a phone restarts,
  so mobile alerts should not be considered 100-percent reliable. Use email or Slack
  alerts if full reliability is required on a mobile device.
- Admins can adjust alert thresholds that affect the frequency of triggered alerts.
- For sites with a high publishing volume, higher thresholds are recommended.
- If you’d like to track cross-domain, contact Parse.ly Support at support@parsely.com
  to enable this.
- Requires logging into the Parse.ly Dashboard
- Overlay is not available on Google AMP pages
- The iOS app only supports authentication via a username and password.
- Shared links do not expire, but access can be revoked via the Shared Links page
  of the account menu.
- Export can download up to 10,000 rows of data in Spreadsheet (XLSX) or CSV format.
- Recrawl individual pages using the API settings page.
- Invitations are sent to the emails listed with log-in instructions.
- Parse.ly authentication options require single sign-on capabilities to be purchased.
  Contact your Relationship Manager for more information.
- The Reports tab shows admins how many reports were run by users over the last 30
  days.
- The API key on the API Settings page matches your Site ID.
- Be sure to safeguard both the API secret and the Conversions API secret.
- If questions come up when integrating Parse.ly, adding features, etc. that aren’t
  covered in documentation, reach out to Parse.ly Support at support@parsely.com for
  help.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The plugin will not work without a valid Site ID.
- The enhanced snippet is only supported in tracker versions above 1.6.0.
- Values in `json-ld` will appear literally inside Parse.ly Analytics.
- The `json-ld` script tag cannot be loaded asynchronously.
- The Parse.ly Crawler is a respectful web citizen.
- Crawling is an entirely back-end operation.
- The Parse.ly Crawler does not execute any JavaScript.
- Before you can evaluate your metadata, your Parse.ly dashboard must be receiving
  pageviews.
- Sandbox metadata collection differs from production methods
- Verify that you have specified the Site ID in the plugin’s options.
- Parse.ly Support will generate this value and provide to you via email.
- Default setting for Disable Autotracking is No.
- The plugin relies on the wp_head() and wp_footer() WordPress functions to work.
- By default, the plugin only tracks posts with the publish status.
- To avoid data leakage, we don’t insert the tracking code in password-protected pages
  when the user hasn’t provided the password.
- When Parse.ly crawls a website, it will read every page’s metadata.
- Having duplicate content can have severe implications, including SEO.
- If using CloudFlare RocketLoader, ensure script tags are served correctly.
- Choose between Self-Managed and Parse.ly-Managed integration for conversions.
- Google authentication and SAML 2.0 are available for Single Sign-On.
- The control headline is being selected as the variant.
- The script is being executed after the first contentful paint.
- Mismatch in the URL or control text.
- You do not have the necessary permissions to create or end tests.
- To open the Debug Panel, append '?vipexp-debug=true' to the page URL.
- API is not suitable for creating dashboards.
- 'Last updated: October 21, 2025'
- Technically, the metadata field can store any arbitrary string, but we recommend
  you format it as JSON.
- This string is limited to 2,000 characters — if it is longer than that, it is ignored.
- Parse.ly measures user interaction data including content views and custom events.
- Apple News real time events include extra data from Apple News.
- Mobile SDKs only support the pageview event.
- For more documentation on how to set up conversions and exactly what data can be
  sent, please see the conversion integration documentation.
- The client-side timestamp cannot be trusted in certain cases.
- Customers often integrate our pipeline with their own ETL before dumping the data
  in Amazon Redshift or BigQuery.
- AWS credentials are provided via an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
- If you are already a Parse.ly customer, your site is already instrumented for Parse.ly’s
  Data Pipeline.
- All data, including IPs and UUIDs, are generated artificially and not intended to
  be associated with any real-world person or device.
- Data is secured via an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
- Data is retained for 90 days by default.
- Data Pipeline tips and advice for getting started working with data
- Make sure to use the profile flag for private customer-specific S3 bucket
- Apple News data is excluded from Data Pipeline data by default.
- Parse.ly automatically removes bot and spider traffic, customer-specified IP addresses
  to ignore, customer-specified domains to ignore, and incorrectly formatted event
  data.
- Parse.ly retains your data for 3 months inside the Data Pipeline AWS S3 bucket and
  separately for 13 months in the Parse.ly Dashboard.
- Parse.ly aggregates and anonymizes customer data for the purpose of studying web-wide
  attention data.
- Parse.ly is covered under Automattic Inc.’s certification under the EU-U.S. Data
  Privacy Framework.
- To ensure seamless Parse.ly operation, you’ll need to add the following directives
  to your CSP.
- The AI components of PCI are optional and will only be added upon request.
- Access to PCI requires enabling the wp-parsely plugin and configuring it with a
  Site ID and API Secret.
- The tracker will no longer load for the small percentage (0.0008%) of traffic that
  still relies on TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
- Theme settings can be set to automatic, light, or dark.
- Requires OAuth2 setup in Parse.ly.
- Make sure to handle token expiration.
- API requires OAuth2 authentication
- Values in the metadata will appear literally inside Parse.ly Analytics.
- All metadata is case sensitive.
- Meta tags take precedence over JSON-LD values.
- Parse.ly uses metadata to distinguish between web pages that are posts and non-posts.
- The metadata field can store any arbitrary string, but it is recommended to format
  it as JSON.
- The Parse.ly tracker requires specific script tags for some video players to function
  properly.
- Without the proper preparation, an upgrade from the manual video tracker to the
  automatic tracker can cause content to be duplicated in the Parse.ly dashboard.
- You’ll also need to contact your account manager to complete the upgrade process.
- Local site administrators can submit individual URLs to recrawl via a form found
  in the Parse.ly dashboard.
- Test this out in a pre-production environment to ensure it does not conflict with
  any of your customizations.
- Ensure that you’ve purchased the Parse.ly API before continuing.
- Requires a single value to run, the Parse.ly Site ID.
- Ensure the Parse.ly tracker code is loaded before processing the queue
- Referrer categorizations affect all Parse.ly users, so customizations aren’t currently
  possible.
- Self-referring page views aren’t included in the Internal page view count.
- The dynamic tracking code must be placed before the standard Parsely tracking snippet.
- Parse.ly’s tracker code loads asynchronously.
- Tracking code loaded via GTM tag template will contain '/p.js?gtm_ver='
- Tracking code loaded via the WordPress plugin will contain '/p.js?ver='.
