- InOrbit uses API keys to authenticate API requests, use of Embeds and calls from
  the Edge SDK.
- InOrbit uses API keys to authenticate API requests.
- All API and SDK access is authenticated with an API Key.
- An API Key identifies your account’s service user.
- An API Key is always associated with a service user in your account and its access
  is managed using role-based access control.
- Default port is 5000.
- Default binding address is localhost.
- All API and SDK access is authenticated with the InOrbit system using an API Key.
- The SDK integrates with both C++ and Python.
- The SDK is designed to work with the InOrbit Agent Core.
- Basic configuration can be handled through InOrbit Control.
- For advanced configuration, it is recommended to use Configuration as Code.
- Dashboards can be customized depending on robot types or other conditions.
- Preferences can be applied at different scopes.
- Mission Tracking is an advanced feature available only in certain editions.
- API Key is always associated with a service user in your account and its access
  is managed using role-based access control.
- Requires configuration of receiver URL for robot models.
- Configuration as Code allows you to customize different InOrbit settings using code.
- Scopes behave like a hierarchy, each level inherits the values from its parent.
- Defines rules about how and when incidents are triggered and notified based on the
  configured statuses.
- Features are in early access and may not be available in all editions.
- Zones are defined for physical spaces identified by locationId and frameId.
- API key is required for CLI access.
