auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.magicplan.app/guide/basic-concepts/estimator-api-endpoints:
  - Every request to the Estimator API requires two headers for authentication. Obtain
    your API credentials from the Authentication and Headers page. The documentation
    references that page for specific header names and values but does not provide
    the exact details in this excerpt.
  - 'The API requires two custom headers for authentication: customer (YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID)
    and key (YOUR_API_KEY). These must be included in every request to the /api/v2
    endpoints.'
- information_source; https://apidocs.magicplan.app/guide/getting-started/authentication-and-headers:
  - 'The magicplan REST API requires two custom headers for authentication on every
    request: customer header containing your Customer ID, and key header containing
    your API Key. Both credentials must be obtained during the API credentials generation
    step and sent as request headers rather than in a bearer token format. Always
    use HTTPS for requests, never expose credentials in public repositories, and rotate
    your API Key immediately if compromised.'
