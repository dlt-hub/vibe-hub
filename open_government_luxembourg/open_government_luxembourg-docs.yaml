auth_info:
- information_source; https://data.public.lu/en/pages/api-tutorial/:
  - API Key authentication is required for data modifications. Include your API Key
    in the HTTP header `X-API-KEY` with the value of your key. Without authentication,
    a 401 error is returned; with an invalid key, a 401 error with message "Invalid
    API Key" is returned; attempting to modify a resource you do not control returns
    a 403 error.
  - API key authentication is required for write operations. The API key must be obtained
    from profile settings and provided in the `X-API-KEY` HTTP header on every request.
    API call permissions are tied to the user's web interface permissions, such as
    organization membership for dataset modifications.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://data.public.lu/en/pages/api-tutorial/:
  - Paginated responses use a Page object containing data array, page number, page_size,
    total count, and next_page/previous_page URL attributes. Use the next_page URL
    directly for subsequent requests; pagination ends when next_page is null.
