auth_info:

  : - Authentication uses ExactID and Password credentials sent as XML fields in the
      request body. Include ExactID and Password as elements within the Transaction
      XML payload sent to the API endpoint.
    - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Credentials are passed as username:password
      (ExactID:Password) in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme. The header
      format is Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>.'
    - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Send credentials as an Authorization
      header with the value "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
      In this example, the header is "Authorization: Basic Foo4BarBazAyOjAhcGl0ZXN0",
      where the base64 portion decodes to your merchant credentials in username:password
      format.'

  - The merchant must include authentication information as hidden parameters in an
    HTML form POST request to the Payment Pages endpoint. Authentication details are
    submitted as part of the form parameters sent to https://checkout.e-xact.com/payment
    (or the demo URL). The specific authentication parameters and their exact names
    are not detailed in this excerpt, but they are described elsewhere in the documentation
    as part of the payment request parameters.

  : - The API uses gateway credentials for authentication. A gateway_id and password
      must be sent in the JSON request body as "gateway_id" and "password" fields
      respectively. These credentials are required in every transaction request to
      the E-xact API endpoint.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://support.e-xact.com/support/solutions/articles/150000065300-transaction-search-and-reporting-api
  : - Offset is an optional query parameter (defaults to 0) indicating the starting
      row position; Rows in the response shows the number of returned rows, and Total
      shows the total available rows. When a single response is limited to 10K rows,
      use Offset to paginate through larger datasets by incrementing it in subsequent
      requests.
    - Pagination uses an offset query parameter (integer) to skip rows; for example
      offset=5 skips rows 0-4. The documentation references a Result Header section
      for pagination details but does not provide those header specifications in the
      excerpt shown.
