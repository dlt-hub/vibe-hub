auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gatling.io/guides/use-cases/basic-auth/:
  - Basic authentication is required, with username and password credentials sent
    via HTTP Basic Auth header. Credentials are loaded from a CSV file (credentials.csv)
    with fields for username and password, and applied using the basicAuth() method
    in the HTTP protocol configuration.
  - 'Basic authentication is used with username and password credentials passed via
    the basicAuth method in the HTTP protocol configuration. Credentials are loaded
    from a CSV file (credentials.csv) with fields for username and password, which
    are referenced as #{username} and #{password} in the basicAuth call. The credentials
    are fed into each request using the feed function from the credentialsFeeder.'
  - Basic authentication using base64-encoded username:password credentials. The Authorization
    header format is `Basic base64(username:password)`, and credentials are loaded
    from a CSV feeder file with username and password columns. The Gatling HTTP protocol
    is configured with `.basicAuth("#{username}", "#{password}")` to automatically
    encode and send credentials in the Authorization header for each request.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with dynamic credentials. Username and
    password are provided via the basicAuth method with placeholders "#{username}"
    and "#{password}" that are populated from a CSV feeder file (credentials.csv)
    during test execution. Credentials are sent in the Authorization header as base64-encoded
    "username:password" pairs on each request.

  - 'Authentication token required in control-plane configuration: token parameter
    must be set to a control plane authentication token in the format "cpt_example_c7oze5djp3u14a5xqjanh...".
    This token is used to authenticate requests from the control plane to the Gatling
    Cloud API at api.gatling.io.'
