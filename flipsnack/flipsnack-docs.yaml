auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.flipsnack.com:
  - The Flipsnack API uses API key authentication. Each user receives an API key that
    must be provided to access the API; the key is active during the subscription
    period and becomes disabled when the subscription ends. The documentation does
    not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or transmission method for
    the API key in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://developers.flipsnack.com/:
  - The Flipsnack API uses an API key-based authentication model. Each user receives
    an API key that must be provided with requests to access their collections and
    data. The API key is tied to the user's subscription and is automatically disabled
    when the subscription ends. Abuse of the API will result in the API key being
    banned.

  - API key and signature-based authentication. The apiKey parameter (required) must
    be provided, and a signature must be calculated and included with the request.
    If apiKey is missing, error code 30 is returned; if incorrect, error code 41.
    If signature is missing, error code 30 is returned; if incorrect, error code 44.
    See the "How to sign a request" documentation for signature calculation details.

  - API key and signature-based authentication required. Send apiKey and signature
    as query parameters (GET requests) or in request body (POST requests). The apiKey
    identifies the user account, and signature is a calculated authentication token.
    See "How to sign requests" documentation for signature calculation details. All
    requests must also include an action parameter specifying the method to execute.

  - Flipsnack uses API key and HMAC signature-based authentication. Requests must
    include an apiKey parameter (your user's API key) and a signature parameter (calculated
    HMAC signature of the request). See "How to sign a request" documentation for
    signature calculation details. Missing apiKey returns error code 30, incorrect
    apiKey returns error code 41, missing signature returns error code 30, and incorrect
    signature returns error code 44.
