notes:
- This module and its available classes are experimental and may change quickly in
  the near future.
- Halton is a low quality sampling method when the dimension is high; it is usually
  better to use Halton with scrambling.
- When the budget is known in advance, it is also better to replace Halton by Hammersley.
- nevergrad is a Python 3.6+ library
- nevergrad is released under the MIT license.
- with zsh you will need to run pip install 'nevergrad[all]' instead of pip install
  nevergrad[all]
- under Windows, you may need to preinstall torch (for benchmark or all installations)
  using Pytorch installation instructions
- Each parametrization has its own random_state for generating random numbers.
- Nevergrad is a plugin in Facebook’s parameter sweeping library.
- Parametrization is still a work in progress and changes are on their way.
- By default, nevergrad does not come with all the requirements for the benchmarks
  to run. Make sure you have installed/updated it with either the benchmark or the
  all flag.
- Don’t forget the 'pip=TRUE'. I wasted so much time because of this :-)
- One simple way to work with/on nevergrad is to use anaconda.
- Installation is now over
- Documentation can be build with `make html` from the `docs` folder.
- Nevergrad requires a CLA for contributors (see in the “Contributing to Nevergad”
  section of the documentation).
- HiPlot requires python version 3.6 or newer
- Fetchers can be created to handle custom Experiment URIs.
- This feature is currently supported for Jupyter Notebooks only. In particular, it
  does not work with Jupyter Lab.
- Uses streamlit caching for performance improvements
- The Javascript library API is very recent, subject to changes, and less used compared
  to the python API.
