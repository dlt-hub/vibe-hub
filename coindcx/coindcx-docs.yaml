auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.coindcx.com:
  - API Key and HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication. Send the API key in the X-AUTH-APIKEY
    header and the HMAC-SHA256 signature of the JSON request body (using your secret
    key) in the X-AUTH-SIGNATURE header. Include a timestamp in milliseconds in the
    request body.
  - API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature validation. Send your API key in
    the X-AUTH-APIKEY header and a computed signature in the X-AUTH-SIGNATURE header.
    The signature is generated by computing an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the JSON request
    body using your secret key.
  - 'API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature with an API key. The key is sent
    in the X-AUTH-APIKEY header, and a signature computed from the JSON request body
    using the secret is sent in the X-AUTH-SIGNATURE header.


    Required headers: X-AUTH-APIKEY (your API key) and X-AUTH-SIGNATURE (HMAC-SHA256
    hex digest of the JSON body using your secret as the key). The signature is generated
    by computing hmac.new(secret_bytes, json_body.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    where secret_bytes is the secret encoded as UTF-8 and json_body is the JSON-serialized
    request body.'
  - API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Send your
    API key in the X-AUTH-APIKEY header and a computed HMAC-SHA256 signature of the
    JSON request body in the X-AUTH-SIGNATURE header. The signature is generated by
    creating an HMAC using your API secret as the key and the JSON-stringified request
    body as the message, then converting to hexadecimal format. The request body must
    include a timestamp field with an EPOCH timestamp in milliseconds.
  - 'API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signatures. Include your API key in the X-AUTH-APIKEY
    header and a computed signature in the X-AUTH-SIGNATURE header. The signature
    is generated by creating an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the JSON request body using your
    secret key.


    Key details: API credentials are key and secret obtained from the website. Request
    body must include a timestamp field (milliseconds since epoch). JSON body is serialized
    without spaces (separators=('','', '':'')). Headers required are Content-Type
    set to application/json, X-AUTH-APIKEY set to your key value, and X-AUTH-SIGNATURE
    set to the hexadecimal digest of the HMAC.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.coindcx.com:
  - Pagination uses "page" (required, string, starting from "1") and "size" (required,
    string, specifies number of results per page) parameters in the request body.
    The documentation does not specify response fields indicating total pages, has_more
    status, or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses `page` (page number, required in request body) and `size` (number
    of records per page, required in request body) parameters. The response structure
    for pagination fields is not documented in the provided excerpt.
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, default 500, min 1) and from_id (optional, trade
    ID threshold) parameters in the POST request body to control result set size and
    starting position for trade history retrieval.
  - Pagination uses page and size parameters in the request body. page specifies the
    page number (starting from 1) and size specifies the number of records per page
    (e.g., 10). The documentation does not describe response fields indicating pagination
    state or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number) and size (records per page).
    Response header x-pagination contains JSON with total, total_pages, next_page,
    previous_page, and offset fields; stop when last_page is true or next_page is
    null.
