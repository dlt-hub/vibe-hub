notes:
- Ensure that each reviewer on your dataset has publishing rights on the State open
  data portal.
- If you don't know or need someone to be added, send an email to the open data team
  to verify.
- If your dataset contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Personal Health
  Information (PHI), follow your departments de-identification guidance as you prepare
  data.
- Review data preparation and formatting guidance and do your best to conform to standards.
- 'Create a document to capture your specific data preparation steps. It should include
  at least: Names of relevant data sources, Relevant contact information for sources
  and update process, Repeatable steps for preparing the dataset, Link to example
  sources and output for reference, A change log table that is updated with the date
  of changes to your documentation if you make them.'
- If merging tables from multiple sources (like counties or regions), check all expected
  fields are accounted for across data sources and check the same number of rows exist
  in your merged dataset as there are in your individual tables.
- Check that data types are consistent within fields in your dataset. For example
  if the field is supposed to be an integer, confirm that it only contains integers.
- Save your tabular data file as a delimited file such as a comma-separated values
  (CSV) file.
- All reviewers must have accounts on data.ca.gov to review the private dataset
- Don't make your dataset public until you've received approval
- Ensure the License is set to Other (Public Domain)
- Ensure the field Visibility is set to Private
- It is important to maintain data updates according to the target frequency indicated
  in the metadata.
- While automated updates are ideal, especially for more frequently updated data,
  we know that sometimes that's not an option.
- Automation will most likely be set up by a technical team in your organization.
- Dataset update steps are captured and annotated through an automated process (e.g.
  scripts or ETL/ELT platform)
- Standardized and user-friendly alerts for automation success and failure are sent
  to appropriate points of contact including technical and program contacts.
- Sufficient logs are kept to ease troubleshooting issues and identifying root causes
  of ongoing problems.
- Open data must be released in the Public Domain and provided at no cost to users.
- Data must be published to an official State open data portal without restrictions.
- No restrictions on public use.
- Ensure the field License is entered as Other (Public Domain)
- Ensure the Visibility is set to Private. This is the default.
- Automated publishing is a consideration for updating data.
- Open data must be in the Public Domain and provided at no cost to users.
- Data must be published in a manner to minimize time between the creation and dissemination
  of the data.
- Data must be provided in an open format.
