notes:
- Enable the legacy REST API.
- Make sure to use the Permission as Read to protect your side data as Readonly.
- FluxBuilder is offered in both desktop and web versions, giving you flexibility
  in how you choose to use it.
- Undo only works within the current session of FluxBuilder. Once you close the project,
  the edit history is cleared.
- Some system-level changes (like saving project settings or syncing with FluxStore
  app) may not be reversible via Undo.
- Frequent Save is still recommended to preserve major changes.
- Response time can be up to 24-48 hours Monday through Friday, not working on weekends.
- Make sure you input https instead of http
- Make sure you do not input sub-folder domain like this <https://yaari.store/pk-en>
  because it causes Rest API issue.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- No environment installation required.
- Help Windows users build the iOS app without a Mac.
- Auto-publish your iOS app to TestFlight.
- If you see images have non-good resolution on FluxBuilder, don't worry, we downgrade
  the resolution of images to improve the speed of FluxBuilder.
- Generate the WooCommerce REST API key and save them to your private file for later
  usage.
- Enable the legacy REST API with Permission as Read to protect your side data as
  Readonly.
- Install the JWT Authentication plugin. This plugin allows the Author to be able
  to create a new Post from the app.
- If you're using Magento 2.4.x, You need to allow OAuth Access Tokens to be used
  as standalone Bearer tokens.
- Strapi APIs security requires setting permissions for access.
- Enable the option Anyone can register.
