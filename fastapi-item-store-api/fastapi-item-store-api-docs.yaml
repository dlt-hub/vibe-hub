notes:
- Livy uses the Spark configuration under SPARK_HOME by default.
- It is strongly recommended to configure Spark to submit applications in YARN cluster
  mode.
- Uses Spring WebFlux and R2DBC for reactive programming.
- Postgres is used for Development/Production and H2 for Testing.
- FastAPI is a framework for building APIs with Python.
- Uvicorn is used as the ASGI server to run the application.
- FastAPI provides automatically generated documentation interfaces for our APIs.
- FastAPI is built on top of the OpenAPI standard.
- Swagger UI allows users to explore and experiment with the API.
- Uses OAuth2 with password grant type
- The resource server and the authorization server share the same security configuration.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
