  in the clinic.
- There is a minimum monthly charge for an active user account.
- Google Chrome is the only recommended and supported web browser.
- Tablets are not recommended for using the CHR, but can be used for the Point of
  Care (POC) or Intake app.
- If running the CHR on a computer with less than 8GB RAM, recommend closing non-essential
  browser tabs, minimizing running applications, and restarting the computer weekly.
- If PDFs are set to download instead of open, they will appear blank when you preview
  PDFs from the CHR.

- Choosing to Print All will include any administrative notes recorded in the chart.
- If the PDF fails to generate and an error appears, it may be due to the size of
  the patient chart.
- If you do not see the Save and validate button in your CHR, contact the TELUS Health
  support team through the support chat for more information.
- If you clicked Save and validate, today’s date appears below Identifications.
- The two areas share the same data points, i.e. if you update one, they are both
  updated.
- Status can be used for analytics reporting.
- Merging patient charts cannot be undone. Therefore merge patient charts when no
  one is using the system to prevent data loss.
- To merge charts, you must have the Merge Patients permission.

- Identification must include a provincial health number or other forms of identification.
- Do not include spaces, hyphens, or slashes in the identification.
- New patients can self-register via the appointment booking site, patient portal
  or CHR Connect if you allow them.
- Any changes to the patient's address(es) must be done from the Patient Data section
  of the chart, otherwise the information will not flow back to the Client Registry.
- Any changes you make to patient demographics are visible to other offices immediately,
  since the patient demographic information is shared across the entire CHR domain.
- You must have the Update CR sync status permission to manually link or unlink patients
  to the Client Registry.
- 'If the Encounter: Owner Restricted Access permission is enabled for your user,
  you see only your own encounters.'
- The most recent 25 encounters appear.
- When opening the encounter, by default, the sections History, Examination, Assessment
  and Plan sections are expanded.
- Only the user who sets the access restrictions can edit those restrictions. In an
  emergency, CHR support can override the restrictions set.
- If you do not have the Restrict access to an Encounter permission, Access restrictions
  is greyed out.
- Restriction owners cannot remove themselves from the user access list. Similarly,
  another user cannot remove the owner of the restriction.
- Users who do not have access to the encounter can see the encounter in the list
  of encounters, but see Restricted Access, Content Not Visible in place of the presenting
  issue.
- If no data is available in the patient chart, i.e. the field you are receiving data
  from is not populated, you see a blue bubble.
- Any patient data variables that do not contain information are deleted automatically
  when you sign the encounter.
- Once a form is added to an encounter, it is available in the Forms section of the
  patient's chart, regardless of whether the encounter has been signed.
- Each user can customize the layout of their encounters
- When you change these settings, they affect only your encounters, and not those
  of other users.
- When you save or sign an encounter, any vitals entered in the encounter's vital
  table are automatically added to the growth chart.
- When updating the patient's height, weight, or head circumference in a Qnaire or
  Patient Data, those values are automatically updated in the growth chart.
- You can start the prescription from various areas of the patient's chart.
- If you type the treatment name and do not select from the list, it is not linked
  to a DIN number.
- These notes are for internal use only and not included on the copy of the prescription
  for the pharmacy.
- If the option to apply prescription signatures by default is not enabled, you are
  prompted to electronically sign the prescription or skip using a digital signature
  (you will have to sign a paper copy of the prescription).
- After signing a prescription in an encounter, you can also Print, Download, Fax,
  or generate a PDF from the Prescriptions area of the encounter.
- You cannot download or open a PDF copy of the prescription from the list of a patient's
  prescriptions.
- If the prescription hasn't been signed, it will be signed when you click the button
  to open a PDF.
- From the Prescriptions area of an encounter, you can only download a PDF of an unsigned
  prescription.
- This feature must be enabled or disabled by the TELUS CHR Support account.
- All forms must be associated with a patient.
- You can share forms with patients using our secure patient portal by adding them
  as an attachment.
- Any edits overwrite the original content.
- You can view the edits by clicking the History icon in the Actions column, however,
  you cannot revert back to the original content.
- When editing a form, click Auto Fill at any time to pull in new data.
- When you create a letter from the patient chart, it is auto-saved every 10 seconds.
- You must have the Referral settings permission to update this setting.
- You must have the Delete patient data entries permission to delete a patient data
  point.
- You cannot restore a deleted data point.
- You can only have one record in Current Pregnancy.
- Pregnancy status defaults to Current.
- To record that a patient has no known drug allergies, you must use the Allergies
  section.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You can upload only one file at a time.
- If your file fails to upload within the allocated upload time and you encounter
  a timeout error, try reducing the size of your file.
- In the patient summary Files section you view only Active files.
- Files that are uncategorized appear in the All tab.
- Older file versions have a red warning banner at the top.
- Default tags are hard-coded in the CHR and you cannot edit or delete them.
- Avoid creating too many tags because this increases the number of tabs in the patient
  chart and makes it more difficult to find documents.
- You must have Patient Settings permissions to configure file tags.
- Deleted tags are deleted permanently.
- Users must have the Patient settings permission enabled.
- When using the CHR AI-powered inbox management feature, the system automatically
  applies file tags if an AI-suggested file name matches your configured clinic file
  name.
- Consider naming your clinic file names the same as the AI suggested file names to
  improve document management efficiency.
- If you do not see a file tag in the list of Active tags, you can configure your
  own clinic-specific ones.
- The CHR has preconfigured standard patient file names. Do not remove or edit these
  names since they are used for preventative care compliance reporting.
- Flowsheet alerts are not available for medications at this time.
- Any new data elements added to a patient's flowsheet apply only to that patient's
  flowsheet.
- You must have the Account Level Alert Settings permission to configure alerts that
  apply to all users in the clinic.
- Alerts are not available for medications at this time.
- Customizations apply only to the user's profile and do not affect others.
- If your CHR is integrated with TELUS Health eClaims, your account has a pre-configured
  list of patient identifiers for eClaim-supported insurers. By default, they are
  marked as inactive in the Inactive tab.
- If a patient requests that you keep their medical records confidential from all
  or some of your clinic members, you can specify who can access the patient's chart.
- By default, patient charts are visible to all users.
- In an emergency, restricted users who have the Force access on a Patient Chart permission
  can still view private charts, but they must state the reason for the override.
- This entry is saved in the patient's chart, making it easy to see from the patient
  dashboard if someone 'forced access'.
- When you restrict access to a chart, you are designated as the owner.
- If a user gains access to a restricted patient chart, the owner of the restriction
  receives an automated inbox message.
- You must have the Restrict access to a Patient Chart permission.
- To gain access to a patient chart you do not have access to due to role-based access
  control, you must have the Break glass on a Patient Chart permission.
- Overriding a role-based access restriction is referred to as 'breaking the glass'.
- Overriding a user-based access restriction is referred to as 'forcing access'.
- TELUS Health will generally enable CII for the clinic for you.
- You must have CII/CPAR settings permissions to manage CPAR panels.
- Certain criteria must be met before your encounter data is sent to Alberta Netcare.
- The CHR checks every 5 minutes for data to send to Netcare, so the status may take
  several minutes to update from pending to the final status.
- You must have CII/CPAR settings permissions to perform bulk actions for a panel
- Use standard preventive care file names to ensure they are captured in the Preventive
  Care Report dashboard.
- Uses provincial screening standard guidelines by default.
- To view these test compliance criteria in the Preventative Care Report dashboard,
  at the top of the window, click the More filter.
- The information provided is our standard configuration. Your dashboard name, reports
  and criteria (age, gender, etc.) may differ.
- You must configure the groups that appear in the list to be filterable.
- If you are in week view, the filter shows all practitioners who have availability
  or an appointment booked on at least one day of that week.
- If you do not see the magnet icon, you can enable it in the scheduling settings.
- You can book up to 104 appointments in one recurring appointment.
- Appointment statuses are the same for group visits. They appear in the Patients
  tab, beside the Reason and are controlled for each patient individually.
- You can use the appointment status to track the attendance of group visits. When
  the patient arrives, change the status to Arrived, or if the patient does not attend,
  select No Show.
- If a provider is added to a group visit and the group visit overlaps with another
  appointment, a warning appears.
- The appointment will appear on the schedule of each provider involved.
- You must have the Scheduling Settings permissions to set up provider schedules for
  your clinic.
- You can have either standard or flex working hours applied to a specific time slot
  in the provider's schedule, not both.
- When a provider is available for appointments, the time appears white on the schedule
  (as opposed to the standard grey background).
- 'To create flex schedule templates, you must have the Templates: Schedules permission.'
- To indicate lunch or administrative time, do not add working hours. Leave them blank
  or fill them by creating lunch or admin time templates.
- You must have Scheduling Settings permissions to set up provider schedules for your
  clinic.
- 'To modify flex schedule templates, you must have the Templates: Schedules permission.'
- Changing the template does not affect the provider schedules where the template
  has already been applied.
- 'To perform this action, you must have the Scheduling: Vacation permission.'
- 'Tip: If you no longer use a group visit type, you can archive it.'
- The system only sends pre-visit reminders if the appointment status is Confirmed,
  Booked, Rescheduled, or Action Required.
- For post-visit reminders, it only sends if the appointment status is Note signed.
- To hide or show your clinic's address and map on all notifications, set the clinic-wide
  option.
- To pull information into the message, such as the patient name, appointment date,
  appointment time and practitioner, choose to Insert Variable.
- If you are using TELUS Collaborative Health Record (CHR) Connect, this option is
  unavailable.
- Patients cannot make partial payments via the Connect app.
- Selected checkboxes change to darker blue.
- If you are creating the invoice at the same time as the bill, start at step 4.
- You can create a Saved Filter to save time when running reports.
- Access to these Private Billing Settings is restricted to the TELUS CHR Support
  account only.
- Depending on your configuration, you may see a credit card icon in the History.
- To perform this action, you must have Billing Dashboard and Quick Bill Entry permissions.
- You must have a spreadsheet application installed on your computer to open a CSV
  file (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers).
- The report contains identifiable patient information. It is your responsibility
  to safeguard the data as per your clinic'c privacy standards.
- The CHR is limited to producing 5,000 rows of data per CSV file. Therefore, if you
  are exporting a large number of bills, multiple files are produced.
