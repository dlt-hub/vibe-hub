  - 'SelectPdf API uses a license key-based authentication. The key parameter must
    be sent with every request either as a query string parameter (for GET requests)
    or in the request body (for POST requests). For POST requests with JSON content
    type, include the key field in the JSON body as key: ''your_license_key_here''.
    For POST requests with form-encoded content type, include key as a form parameter.
    The API endpoint is https://selectpdf.com/api2/convert/.'
  - The API requires a license key for authentication. A 401 Authorization Required
    response code is returned when the license key is not specified. The license key
    must be provided to successfully authenticate API requests.
  - 'The API requires a license key for authentication. Send the key parameter with
    your license key value in either GET query parameters (key=your_license_key_here)
