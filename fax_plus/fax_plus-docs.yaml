    an additional required header x-fax-clientid containing the client ID when using
    OAuth2. The access_token is set in the Configuration object, and the client ID
    is passed via the x-fax-clientid header to the ApiClient.

    object, with an additional required header "x-fax-clientid" containing the clientId
    value sent in all requests to the API endpoint at https://restapi.fax.plus/v3.
  - The API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Include the Authorization header
    with value "Bearer {access-token}". When using OAuth2, also include the required
