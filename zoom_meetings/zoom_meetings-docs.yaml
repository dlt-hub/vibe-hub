notes:
- Ensure you have required scopes for the API endpoints you are accessing.
- A subset of users not able to use OAuth for authentication
- Older SDK versions work on older browsers, but upgrading is strongly recommended.
- Zoom API requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Ensure to handle rate limits as per Zoom API guidelines.
- Requires OAuth2 setup with Zoom Developer account
- Requires a Zoom account with API access
- Rate limits apply to API usage
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Zoom
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Requires OAuth2 setup for authentication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Webhook integration requires validation of endpoint URL in Zoom app.
- On iOS, the video screen stays black, though audio is functioning.
- On both Android and iOS, the video does not render in full-screen mode despite passing
  the proper resolution and aspect ratio parameters.
- Ensure you have the correct scopes for API access.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup in Zoom App Marketplace
- OAuth2 is required for accessing the API.
- Ensure proper scopes are set for the OAuth app.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- To support Chrome 137+ and Safari 18.4+, please upgrade to Meeting SDK for Web v3.13.1+
  and Video SDK for Web v2.2.0+ (or v1.12.17 if using 1.x).
- The close_captions option has not been yet implemented.
- Validation failed for key CFBundleShortVersionString must be a period-separated
  list of at most three non-negative integers.
- We do not support token_index anymore in our S2S app.
- We’re working on streamlining our docs!
- As we transition if there is anything that you see could use some improvement or
  we missed something please let us know.
- We see this new interface as an improvement in clarity and discoverability of our
  (large!) set of references.
- To support Chrome 137+ and Safari 18.4+, please upgrade to Meeting SDK for Web v3.13.1+
  and Video SDK for Web v2.2.0+.
- The REST APIs have a limit of 100 APIs per day.
- Ensure the application is set up properly for OAuth2.
- Ensure proper OAuth scopes are set.
- Use of refresh token is required for long-term access.
- If you want to use it internally for testing purposes you can do that without publishing
  it.
- It just started working. Not sure what changed or why.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access contact center data.
- Zoom Apps run a single instance of webview for all Zoom Contact Center engagements,
  with the SDK events emitting to the app when new engagements are started, or when
  agents switch between active events.
- Uses OAuth2 for authorization.
- Response may vary based on the request parameter 'type'.
- Reauthorizing the webhook with updated permissions may fix notification issues.
- Built-in authentication, API wrappers and event subscriptions let you focus on business
  logic, not infrastructure.
- Responses may not be consistently accurate or contextually relevant.
- Ensure the variable names are case sensitive.
- The script widget is executed in the Zoom Contact Center cloud service, not on the
  agent’s computer. The script widget is intended to be used for backend API calls,
  not for agent screen pop.
- You can use a script widget in the Flow to collect data, and store them as variables,
  and those variables can then be added to the Launch URL as query parameters.
- Currently, the Flow does not have direct access to the Address Book.
- To integrate virtual agent in website, install the chat SDK script to your web pages.
- The response uses JSON dot Notation.
- The dates announced for the EOL of the JWT app type, do not apply to our FedRAMP
  customers.
- I would suggest that you start implementing the migration to Server to Server OAuth
  to guarantee a smooth transition.
- The page size value should reflect the number of records returned in the response.
- Server-to-Server OAuth app is available for Zoom for Gov.
- JWT would be decommission for ZoomGov in October 2023
- API may require specific user roles to access certain endpoints.
- Rate limits apply based on user account type.
- Requires Zoom account with API access
- Rate limits apply for API requests
- Ensure proper OAuth setup for authentication.
- Upgrade to Meeting SDK for Web v3.13.1+ and Video SDK for Web v2.2.0+.
