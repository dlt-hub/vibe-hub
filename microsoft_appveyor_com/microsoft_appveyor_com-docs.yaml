  - AppVeyor REST API uses bearer token authentication. Acquire your API token from
    https://ci.appveyor.com/api-keys and pass it in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    <token>".
  - 'Multiple notification services require authentication tokens or credentials passed
    as follows: authToken (used by HipChat, Slack, GitHubPullRequest, and others)
    is a stored credential value; Slack also accepts incomingWebhookUrl; VSOTeamRoom
    requires username and password; Webhook supports custom headers via the headers
    and headersValue fields. All authToken fields reference a StoredValue type for
    secure credential storage.'
