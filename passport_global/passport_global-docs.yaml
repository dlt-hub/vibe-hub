auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.passportglobal.com/:
  - Authentication is done by providing an API key on every request as a custom HTTP
    header named X-Access-Token. The API key is provided by the Passport Global onboarding
    team during account setup. All requests must use HTTPS and the POST method.
  - The API uses API key authentication. Your Onboarding team will provide an API
    key to your designated point of contact. Include this API key in your requests
    to authorize access; a 401 Unauthorized response indicates an invalid or missing
    API key. The documentation does not specify the exact header name or parameter
    name where the API key should be sent.
