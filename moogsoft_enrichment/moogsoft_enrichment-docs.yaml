auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.moogsoft.com/Enterprise.8.0.0/en/-enrichment.html:
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are passed via the `-u` flag
    in cURL (or the `Authorization` header with base64-encoded `username:password`).
    The example shows `-u graze:graze`, indicating username and password authentication.
    Additionally, a required `auth_token` string parameter must be included in the
    request arguments.
- information_source; https://docs.moogsoft.com/Enterprise.8.0.0/en/graze-api.html:
  - All Graze API requests, except for the authenticate endpoint, require either a
    basic authentication header or a valid auth_token. Basic authentication uses standard
    HTTP basic auth credentials sent in the Authorization header, while auth_token
    can be obtained from the authenticate endpoint and subsequently included in requests
    (likely as a header or parameter, though the specific mechanism is not detailed
    in this excerpt).
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication via the `auth_token` parameter. This
    token can be passed either as a query parameter in the URL (e.g., `?auth_token=b40244fd79aa46fba76c60c56d538c49`)
    or as a field in the JSON request body (`{"auth_token": "b40244fd79aa46fba76c60c56d538c49"}`).
    UTF-8 character encoding is assumed by default.'
- information_source; https://docs.moogsoft.com/Enterprise.8.0.0/en/oauthendpoints.html:
  - OAuth2.0/OIDC tokens are fetched using the getOAuthToken action and added as authorization
    headers to REST requests. Multiple OAuth endpoints can be configured for use with
    the Workflow Engine, and the obtained tokens are used with exportViaRest, sendViaRest,
    and exportViaRestWithRetry actions.
- information_source; https://docs.moogsoft.com/moogsoft-cloud/en/get-started-with-apis.html:
  - API key authentication is required. Generate an instance-specific API key in Incident
    Management and pass it in the Auth and Parameters box as apiKey parameter. API
    keys are instance-specific, so the key generated in a particular instance will
    execute requests on that system.
