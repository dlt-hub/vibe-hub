auth_info:
- information_source; https://ww1.autotask.net/help/developerhelp/content/APIs/REST/General_Topics/REST_Using_Postman.htm:
  - The API uses a username and password (secret) for authentication. Postman automatically
    populates the API request headers with the provided credentials when configured
    in the collection settings.
  - 'The Autotask REST API uses API account credentials sent via request headers.
    Set up Postman collection variables with: webservices[n] (zone identifier like
    "webservices3"), ApiIntegrationCode (custom tracking identifier from Autotask
    Resources page), UserName (API account username), and Secret (API account password).
    Postman automatically populates the request headers with these values for authentication.'
- information_source; https://ww1.autotask.net/help/developerhelp/content/apis/rest/General_Topics/REST_Using_Postman.htm:
  - API authentication uses a username and password (secret) pair. Postman automatically
    populates the API request headers for the collection with the provided credentials.
  - 'API requests require four variables to be configured in Postman: webservices[n]
    (zone identifier), ApiIntegrationCode (custom tracking identifier), UserName (API
    account username), and Secret (API account password). These variables are automatically
    populated into request headers by Postman after configuration.'
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://ww1.autotask.net/help/developerhelp/content/apis/rest/API_Calls/REST_Advanced_Query_Features.htm
  : - MaxRecords is a query parameter in the search JSON body specifying the maximum
      records per page, with a valid range of 1 to 500. Use the previous or next page
      URLs returned by the API to navigate pages; if you change MaxRecords in subsequent
      requests, the API ignores it and uses the original value.
- ? information_source; https://ww1.autotask.net/help/developerhelp/content/apis/rest/API_Calls/REST_Resource_Child_Access_URLs.htm
  : - A standard query response contains a collection of items and a pagination element
      with previousUrl and nextUrl fields. To navigate pages, send a GET request to
      the supplied previousUrl or nextUrl without modification. Maximum page size
      is 500 records, and the API retains history for only the 50 most recently viewed
      pages.
