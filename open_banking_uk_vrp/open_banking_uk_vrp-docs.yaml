auth_info:
- information_source; https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v4.0/profiles/read-write-data-api-profile.html:
  - Authorization header is mandatory for all request types (POST, GET, DELETE, PUT)
    and supports OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with Basic or Bearer authentication schemes. Additionally,
    optional FAPI headers include x-fapi-auth-date (HTTP-date format), x-fapi-customer-ip-address
    (PSU IP), and x-fapi-interaction-id (RFC4122 UID for correlation).
  - Authorization header missing or invalid token results in 401 Unauthorized response.
    Token must have correct scope or security policies will be violated resulting
    in 403 Forbidden. The API requires an Authorization header with a valid token
    for authentication.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer Az90SAOJklae". Additionally, include required headers x-fapi-auth-date,
    x-fapi-customer-ip-address, and x-fapi-interaction-id with appropriate values.
  - Authorization header with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Specific scopes and grant types
    are defined per API endpoint. TPPs must use variable-length storage for authorization
    codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens as lengths may change over time. Fine-grained
    permissions are managed via intents (account-access-consent, funds-confirmation-consents,
    payment order consents) created using client credentials grant, with the intent-id
    passed to the PSU for consent authorization.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer Az90SAOJklae". Additionally, include the following headers in
    requests: x-fapi-auth-date (timestamp), x-fapi-customer-ip-address (client IP),
    and x-fapi-interaction-id (unique request identifier). The x-fapi-interaction-id
    must also be returned in the response.'
