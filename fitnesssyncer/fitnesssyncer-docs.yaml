- Apple Health is only available within FitnessSyncer for IOS.
- Google Health Connect and Samsung Health are only available within FitnessSyncer
  for Android.

- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- FitnessSyncer for Android will either sync Google Health Connect when you press

- Only supports activities with deep analytics.
- Fitbit does not show your steps in the 7-day total, and steps uploaded from any
  third party do not count in any challenges. To see any activities we uploaded, use
  Fitbit’s Activity Log.
- Fitbit only generates proper TCX files for activities with GPS data, and as such,
  we do not have the rich data required to be useful at services that require detailed
  activity data.
- For any data that Fitbit licenses, they do not provide the detailed nutritional
  data to us.
- Strava throttles third parties excessively, which means that requests to Strava
  will take some time.
