auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/authentication.html:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used, where credentials are sent via the Authorization
    header with the scheme "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
    The check_auth method in the BasicAuth class validates the credentials and can
    apply different logic per resource and HTTP method. Clients must include the Authorization
    header with properly encoded credentials to access protected endpoints; requests
    without valid credentials receive a 401 UNAUTHORIZED response.
- information_source; https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/tutorials/account_management.html:
  - Basic Authentication is used to secure API endpoints. Clients send credentials
    (username and password) to authenticate. The `/accounts` endpoint manages account
    creation and authentication, while other API endpoints require authenticated access.
    Authenticated users can only access resources they created themselves.
  - Token authentication is implemented as a specialized version of Basic Authentication
    where the username field contains the token and the password field is ignored.
    Tokens must be generated and stored with the account, then returned to the client
    on account creation. Authentication is performed by including the token in the
    username field of a standard Basic Authentication request.
