notes:
- ChEMBL web services can be used together or independently to build applications
  and data processing workflows relevant to drug discovery and chemical biology.
- The online service allows to easily run predictions, without installing any software,
  as well to share online datasets and models.
- Requires setup of connected app in NOAA NCEI
- Data may vary in availability and structure
- Data are made available, filtered and processed at source through a standards-based
  interface.
- The WMT client is supported on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
- Computations and analyses are remotely executed in high-end servers.
- SWS enables interoperability between workflow systems and SRS implementations
- Returns results in a text-only format
- The REMORA web server is freely available
- Data is accessed in standard formats in a POSIX file system.
- Provides a wide range of data including weather information, ocean data on reefs,
  tides
- Uses RESTful calls for data retrieval
- This dataset was produced by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace for EnviroAtlas
  in order to support public access to and use of information related to environmental
  markets.
- EnviroAtlas allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
  to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
- SCALEUS is available as open source.
- The API allows cryosphere scientists to run ISSM on the client side of a web page
  within the JavaScript environment.
- Access to articles may depend on the specific query parameters used.
- The IAServ platform integrates various web services for healthcare delivery.
- Lynx provides access to the integrated database and the analytical tools via REST
  based Web Services.
- API requires an API key for access.
