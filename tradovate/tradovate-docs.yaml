- information_source; https://api.tradovate.com/:
  - Access tokens are obtained by sending client credentials (name, password, appId,
    appVersion, cid, deviceId, sec) in a JSON POST request to the /v1/auth/accesstokenrequest
    endpoint. The returned accessToken is then used with the Bearer authentication
    scheme in the Authorization request header field to access protected resources.
  - Acquire an Access Token using the standard Access procedure, then open a WebSocket
    connection and send the access token using the WebSocket authorization procedure.

    header as `Authorization: Bearer ${myAccessToken}`. The token is passed as a bearer_access_token
    and must be obtained prior to making API requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses a two-step process: first, call the accesstokenrequest endpoint
    with username (name), password, appId, appVersion, deviceId, cid, and sec in the
    JSON request body to obtain an accessToken; then, use that accessToken as a bearer
    token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests like the /auth/me endpoint.'
