auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.tui/docs/general/oauth2:
  - OAuth2 Bearer token authentication is required for TUI APIs. Obtain tokens from
    the /oauth2/token endpoint using either HTTP Basic Authentication with base64-encoded
    consumer_id:consumer_secret in the Authorization header, or by including client_id
    and client_secret as form parameters. Use the resulting Bearer token in subsequent
    API requests. An app with valid API subscription for the target environment is
    required.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain access tokens. For the playground
    environment, send a POST request to /oauth2/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
    grant_type=client_credentials, and Authorization header with Basic auth (base64-encoded
    client_id:client_secret). For the prod environment, send the same POST request
    to https://prod.api.tui/oauth2/token with grant_type, client_id, and client_secret
    as form data values. The response contains an access_token with token_type Bearer,
    valid for 3599 seconds (approximately one hour). Use the access_token as a Bearer
    token in the Authorization header for subsequent API calls. Environment variables
    CONSUMER_ID_VALUE and CONSUMER_SECRET_VALUE hold the client credentials.
