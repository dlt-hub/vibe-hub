notes:
- GenAuth provides professional identity authentication and authorization services
  for enterprises and developers on the cloud.
- You can connect applications on any platform to GenAuth.
- Identity automation portal will only be displayed if you have the identity automation
  benefit.
- Applications share a user directory
- Control which users can access your application
- GenAuth supports multiple user login methods.
- 'Recommended standard protocols: OIDC > SAML2 > CAS 1.0 > LDAP > OAuth2.0.'
- Authorization can ensure the use security and data security of product systems.
- Good authorization functions will enhance product value and make it more competitive
  in the market.
- Standard protocols will pass user information in a specific way.
- Client stores the Token and carries it with each request.
- ID Token is a JWT Token that contains user's identity information.
- Refresh Token is used to obtain a new AccessToken.
- Multi-Factor Authentication requires enabling additional authentication methods.
- The same Refresh Token is returned each time until it expires.
- MFA requires users to use at least two factors to verify their identity.
- LDAP allows users to search for individuals without knowing their location.
- LDAP is used in Microsoft's Active Directory.
- Scanning code login connects the web end and the app end through QR codes.
- GenAuth Pipeline uses a serverless architecture on the backend.
- Permission management generally refers to the fact that users can access and only
  access their authorized resources according to the security rules or security policies
  set by the system, no more and no less.
- Authorization mode based on OIDC framework
- API calls are only open to partner companies.
- Different partners have different access rights.
- GenAuth dynamically determines which permissions to issue based on the resource
  and context requested by the caller.
- The resource party must verify whether the caller carries an AccessToken with permissions
  before returning the resource.
- Local verification of JWT Token is recommended to save server bandwidth and speed
  up verification.
- Local verification of JWT Token is recommended for better performance.
- User pool created in GenAuth does not use a unified third-level domain name by default.
- To use a unified domain name, turn on the 'Use unified domain name for all applications'
  switch.
- UserPool ID and UserPool Secret can be found in the console under Settings -> Basic
  Settings -> Key Management
- You need to join your business data with the GenAuth user locally, and associate
  the user ID with the business data.
- By default, the user pool created in GenAuth does not use a unified third-level
  domain name.
- You can modify the unified third-level domain name of this user pool in the User
  Pool Settings->Basic Settings->Basic Information tab.
- Starting with version 13.1, Safari will block third-party cookies by default, affecting
  some single sign-on features of GenAuth.
- Identifying user source can be done by defining a custom field in GenAuth console.
- Ensure the server's firewall rules allow GenAuth server to access
- Please make sure that the server's firewall rules allow GenAuth server to access.
- 在访问授权页「允许所有用户访问」
- authing integrates all mainstream applications
- 需要记住 ProviderName 的值，本示例中为 TestTencent。
- AccountID 是你的腾讯云账号 ID，从腾讯云账号信息中获取。
- The RBAC model is simpler to build but cannot authorize resources in a fine-grained
  manner.
- The ABAC model is complex to build but allows for fine-grained and dynamic execution
  based on context.
- When authorizing resources, we can specify restrictions.
- You can form flexible policy authorization statements based on these attributes.
- GenAuth supports RBAC and provides SDKs for various programming languages.
- Requires setup of connected app in GenAuth
- You can create a business application in the Self-built Application menu, configure
  the registration/login method of the application, control access rights, customize
  the login box and security rules, configure whether to enable application authorization
  when logging in, and configure the subject that can access this application.
- GenAuth As a service provider (SP), you can integrate APP into GenAuth; as an identity
  provider (IDP), you can use GenAuth for authentication.
- You can turn on the registration prohibition switch in Security Settings->General
  Security->Registration Security in the console
- You can turn on the Frequent registration limit switch in Security Settings->General
  Security->Registration Security of the console to limit the number of registrations
  within a certain number of seconds
- You can turn on the Login failure limit switch in Settings - Security Information
  of the console to limit the number of failed logins of the same account within a
  certain number of seconds
- GenAuth LDAP 2.0 requires the use of identity automation related capabilities.
- The Base DN of LDAP 1.0 is composed of ou=users,o=USER_POOL_ID,dc=authing,dc=cn,
  and the Base DN of LDAP 2.0 is composed of dc=DOMAIN1,dc=DOMAIN2,o=authing.
- Inconsistent directory structures may change organizational information in LDAP
  downstream applications.
- The password cannot be modified manually.
- If you have LDAP upstream synchronization enabled, data will be synchronized back
  to the GenAuth user pool.
- BindDN is mainly used with secret to complete authentication
- BaseDN defines where the user operates from
- BindDN is mainly used with secret to complete authentication.
- BaseDN defines where the user operates from.
- Administrators can use the console to visually manage user accounts.
- Operations performed as an administrator do not require verification methods such
  as mobile phone number verification code, email verification code, MFA, etc.
- Sensitive operations such as delete should be handled carefully.
- GenAuth provides a built-in, highly configurable login form.
- You can view the user's most recent login location on the User Details page.
- Perform operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, and querying a group of
  users, and assigning authorizations.
- Support setting the validity period of the invitation link
- Support enabling the administrator approval function
- Social identity source login refers to the process in which users use the identity
  authentication information of a third-party social platform to authenticate and
  log in to the current URL.
- Social login not only helps to simplify the user's login experience, but also provides
  users with a simpler and more convenient way to register and log in.
- Users can log in directly through their third-party account.
- Users can log in using various methods including account password and third-party
  accounts.
- Account Identity Association allows users to log in directly to existing accounts.
- New users are created by default when logging in through an identity source for
  the first time.
- Web security domain name must be configured when using JavaScript SDK on the front
  end.
- The free version does not support this feature yet.
- The feature is not currently supported in the free version.
- The password encryption function takes effect immediately after uploading and will
  affect existing users. It is recommended to use this feature in a completely new
  user pool.
- If you need to modify the password encryption function in an old user pool, please
  contact [GenAuth After-sales Service](mailto:csm@genauth.ai).
