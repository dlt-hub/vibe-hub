pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.onlinepaymentplatform.com:
  - Pagination uses a has_more boolean field in the response to indicate if additional
    results exist, along with a total_item_count field showing the total number of
    items. When has_more is false, all results have been retrieved.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. Response includes has_more
    boolean, total_item_count, items_per_page, current_page, and last_page fields
    to indicate pagination state. Continue requesting with incremented offset while
    has_more is true or current_page is less than last_page.
  - Pagination uses limit and page query parameters. Response includes has_more boolean,
    total_item_count, items_per_page, current_page, and last_page fields to navigate
    pages. Stop paginating when has_more is false or current_page equals last_page.
  - Pagination uses query parameter page (optional, defaults to 1) to request specific
    pages. Response includes has_more (boolean), total_item_count (total transactions),
    items_per_page (10), current_page, and last_page to indicate pagination state
    and navigate through pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (current page number) and perpage (items
    per page limit). Response includes has_more boolean to indicate if more pages
    exist, total_item_count for total objects, current_page, last_page, and items_per_page
    fields to track pagination state.
