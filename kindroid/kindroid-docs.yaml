notes:
- All endpoints require authentication, use the authorization header with bearer {your
  api key, which should start with kn }
- You should only play around with the API if you're a developer interested in tinkering
  with integrating Kindroid.
- Do not share your key with anyone who asks.
- Prices are listed in USD and may vary based on regional pricing and exchange rates
  outside of the US.
- Creating voice sample previews requires audio credits.
- Audio credits for V3 will incur 1.5x that of V2 to reflect their cost.
- All audio and video are processed ephemerally and aren't stored.
- Voice call settings allow for unified chat/voice chat history toggle.
- Group selfies are a subscriber only feature, and each group selfie once finished
  will appear in each participating Kindroid's gallery.
- Group selfies are a subscriber only feature.
- Video selfies can be made with both standard selfie credits or paid selfie credits.
- Group chat is available only to paid subscribers and functions similarly as an individual
  text chat.
- Each Kindroid will be able to access its own backstory and memories, but not each
  other's.
- Ensure you have full control of the shared Kindroid to avoid API connection failures.
- Free users will have unlimited messages on their Discord bots for a limited time
  for launch but we will rate limit this likely in the future.
