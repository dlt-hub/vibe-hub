- information_source; https://support.cordial.com/hc/en-us/articles/18799979779085-Asynchronous-API:
  - The Asynchronous API uses an x-api-key header for authentication. The header name
    is x-api-key and its value should be your Cordial API key, which you can create
    from within the Cordial platform. The API key is passed as a request header with
    each API call.
- information_source; https://support.cordial.com/hc/en-us/articles/203885498-RESTful-API-summary-and-usage:
  - 'Basic Authentication using an API key. Pass your account API key as the username
    in an HTTP Basic Auth header (base64-encoded), leaving the password blank. The
    Authorization header format is: Authorization: Basic <base64(api_key:)>.'
  - Cordial's core APIs use HTTP Basic Authentication. An API key generated from the
    Cordial platform is passed as the username in the Authorization header, with the
    password field left empty. The credentials are encoded and sent via the standard
    HTTP Basic Auth mechanism.
- information_source; https://support.cordial.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023998032-REST-channel-overview:
  - The Cordial API uses HTTP basic authentication. You must encode your API key using
    base64 and add it as an Authorization header in the HTTP request. The header key
    is "Authorization" and the value should be the base64-encoded API key. Additional
    authentication methods are planned for future releases.
- information_source; https://support.cordial.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402427843597-Global-API-error-responses:
  - API logging must be enabled for the API key in use. Navigate to Settings > API
    Keys, select the API key, and set API logging to Enabled.
