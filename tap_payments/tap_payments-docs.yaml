pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.tap.company/reference/list-all-authorize:
  - Cursor-based pagination using starting_after parameter (an authorize ID) to retrieve
    subsequent pages. Limit parameter controls page size with default of 25 and maximum
    of 50 authorizes per request.
- information_source; https://developers.tap.company/reference/download-charges:
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme with limit and starting_after parameters
    in the request body. The response headers provide last_charge_id (used as starting_after
    in the next request), number_of_pages, and has_more flag. Stop paginating when
    has_more is false or all number_of_pages are processed.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with starting_after parameter in the request
    body set to the last_charge_id from the previous response. Stop when has_more
    is false or all number_of_pages are processed. Include limit (default 100000)
    and starting_after in all requests after the first.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, max 100,000) and starting_after (query
    parameter, set to last_charge_id from previous response). Response headers include
    has_more (boolean), page_size, number_of_pages, and last_charge_id. Continue iterating
    until has_more is false or all number_of_pages are processed.
- information_source; https://developers.tap.company/reference/list-all-invoices:
  - page (int32, defaults to 0) and limit (int32, defaults to 25, maximum 50) are
    query parameters controlling pagination. Use page to specify the starting page
    and limit to control the number of invoices returned per request.
