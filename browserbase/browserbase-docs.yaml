notes:
- A browser session is the fundamental building block in Browserbase - it represents
  a single browser instance running in the cloud.
- Uses API key for authentication — ensure to set BROWSERBASE_API_KEY environment
  variable
- API is rate limited based on plan’s concurrent session limits.
- All REST endpoints are authenticated using your Browserbase API Key
- The create session API is rate limited based on your plan’s concurrent session limits.
- Real-time monitoring and debugging tools for your browser sessions
- Sessions have a default timeout configured at the project level, which can be customized
  when creating a session.
- To prevent premature termination, make sure to implement proper error handling and
  cleanup in your code.
- Required range for browserMinutes and proxyBytes is x >= 0
- The free plan includes one browser session running at a time
- 60 minutes of browser time per month
- AES-256-CBC is currently the only supported algorithm.
- Get your Browserbase API Key and Project ID from the Overview Dashboard
- Be sure to set your BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID, and OPENAI_API_KEY
  environment variables to the values you copied.
- Headless browsers unlock new possibilities for developers.
- Running headless browsers in production presents significant challenges.
- The free plan includes one browser session running at a time and 60 minutes of browser
  time per month.
- Get your API key and Project ID from the Overview Dashboard.
- Get your API Key and Project ID from the Overview Dashboard.
- Be sure to set your BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID environment variables.
- Stealth Mode enables your automated browser sessions to mimic real user behavior
  across different sessions and IPs.
- Basic Stealth Mode handles surface-level challenges like visual CAPTCHAs and generates
  random, realistic fingerprints and viewports for each session.
- Advanced Stealth Mode reduces the chances of being flagged as a bot by using a custom
  version of the Chrome browser.
- Set your BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID environment variables.
- Enabling proxies is recommended for higher CAPTCHA success rates and required for
  bypassing some antibot systems.
- 'Certain high-risk categories are restricted by our proxy providers and cannot be
  accessed through proxies, including: All Apple domains, including iTunes and App
  stores, Entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Playstation), Banking and other financial
  institutions, Some Google domains, Streaming, Ticketing, Mailing, Some .gov domains'
- 'Certain high-risk categories are restricted by our proxy providers and cannot be
  accessed through proxies, including: All Apple domains, Entertainment, Banking and
  other financial institutions, Some Google domains, Streaming, Ticketing, Mailing,
  Some .gov domains.'
- Live Views can be useful for debugging and observability.
- Human in the loop - instantly take control or provide input.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Custom dimensions outside the predefined viewport sizes are not allowed.
- Custom dimensions outside supported values are not allowed to ensure consistent
  performance, rendering accuracy, and anti-bot stealth effectiveness.
- Session recordings provide a representation of the session’s data, unique id, timestamp,
  and type of session.
- Our browser recording feature is only designed for single tab workflows.
- Session recordings are a representation of the session’s data, unique id, timestamp,
  and type of session.
- Recordings are available about 30 seconds after session close
- Recordings are disabled on a few sites, like Opentable and the Salesforce family
  of sites
- Files downloaded during browser automation are stored in Browserbase’s cloud storage.
- The files are returned as a ZIP archive.
- The files must be retrieved using the API.
- You can easily upload files to websites using Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium.
- For optimal performance, it is recommended to use CDP sessions for screenshots.
- For optimal performance, use CDP sessions to capture screenshots.
- Automatically downloads PDFs when navigating to PDF URLs.
- Contexts allow you to persist user data across multiple browser sessions.
- Contexts are uniquely encrypted at rest to ensure security.
- The size of the stored JSON object is limited to 512 characters.
- Adding adequate waits between form interactions ensures the form has time to load
  and the elements are ready for interaction.
- Implement error handling for missing elements or validation failures.
- 'Respect robots.txt: Check the website’s robots.txt file for crawling guidelines'
- 'Rate limiting: Implement reasonable delays between requests (2-5 seconds)'
- 'Terms of Service: Review the website’s terms of service before scraping'
- 'Data usage: Only collect and use data in accordance with the website’s policies'
- Every test session is automatically recorded and available in the Browserbase dashboard.
- Session recording happens automatically, allowing you to diagnose flaky tests and
  failures with ease.
- Avoid using multi tab browser sessions for better performance.
- Disable CSS, images, JavaScript, and other unwanted assets to speed up page downloads.
- To optimize your costs, consider reusing browser sessions since there is a one-minute
  minimum billing period for each session creation.
- Avoid using multi tab browser sessions for better performance
- Disable CSS, images, JavaScript, and other unwanted assets to speed up page downloads
- Optimize page loading with waitUntil option to improve load speed
- Session keep alive is only available on paid plans.
- The maximum duration of a session is 6 hours.
- Running browser sessions in or near your region will confer substantial performance
  gains.
- All sessions are created in us-west-2 by default.
- Session metadata allows you to tag and categorize sessions for better tracking,
  segmentation, and analysis.
- Metadata persists throughout the entire session lifecycle - if you restart your
  session, your metadata stays intact
- Only field queries are supported (no array querying)
- Only string equality checks are available
- Understanding your proxy and session usage is essential for optimizing costs, managing
  quotas, and ensuring efficient automation.
- Metadata can be under 512 characters and must be a nested JSON structure without
  arrays.
- Browser hours and proxy bandwidth renew monthly.
- Sessions are billed by the minute, with the first minute rounded up.
- Each browser session requires dedicated resources and has a minimum runtime of one
  minute, even if closed before.
- Many websites require authentication before allowing access to protected content
  or actions.
- Handling authentication in automation requires maintaining session state, avoiding
  bot detection, and resolving challenges like CAPTCHAs or multi-factor authentication
  (MFA).
- Browserbase provides flexible methods for handling authentication in automated sessions.
- SSO is available only to Enterprise Plans.
- Uses cookies-based Sessions to speed up automation.
- Session Live View allows for manual login to persist authentication.
- 'Zero Data Retention: Disable Logging and Session Recording via the Create Session
  API to ensure no data is recorded.'
- User roles only affect what permissions a user has within the dashboard itself.
  They don’t change who can interact with sessions via the API, that’s what your API
  key is used for.
- Browserbase lets you run cloud browsers with the exact network identity you need.
- By routing traffic through your own static proxy or VPN, you can control your browser’s
  IP address and location.
- User roles only affect what permissions a user has within the dashboard itself.
- Enable your crewAI Agents to browse the web like humans.

- The current year must be specified in the prompt for relative date reasoning.
- The description will be provided to the Flights Agent who will call the Kayak Tool
  to build a valid Kayak search URL.
