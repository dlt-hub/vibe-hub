auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/api/swagger/:
  - Most of the GoToSocial API endpoints require a user-level OAuth token. For detailed
    authentication information, see the authentication documentation at the provided
    link.
- information_source; https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/api/authentication/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" when making API requests to endpoints like
    GET /api/v1/notifications.
  - GoToSocial uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Register an application to obtain
    client_id and client_secret, then authorize via browser at https://instance/oauth/authorize
    with query parameters client_id, redirect_uri (urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob), response_type
    (code), and scope (e.g. read). Scopes restrict token permissions; versions below
    0.19.0 grant full permissions including admin actions. Exchange the authorization
    code for an access token in subsequent steps.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Exchange client_id, client_secret, and
    authorization code at the token endpoint to obtain an access_token. Include the
    access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" for all
    subsequent API requests.
  - The API uses OAuth2 authentication. To authenticate, first register an application
    via POST to /api/v1/apps with client_name, redirect_uris (use "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"
    for out-of-band flow), and scopes parameters in JSON body. This returns credentials
    used to request an OAuth token. Scopes control permissions; use the minimum required
    (e.g., "read" for read-only access).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/federation/actors/:
  - Use the `page=true` query parameter to access paginated outbox items. The response
    includes a `first` field pointing to the first page URL. Dereference the `first`
    page URL to retrieve items; subsequent pagination details are implied by the ActivityPub
    OrderedCollection specification.
