- information_source; https://www.blocknotejs.org/docs/features/collaboration/comments:
  - RESTYjsThreadStore requires an Authorization header with a Bearer token passed
    in the optional headers object. The token is sent with each REST API request to
    the base URL. Authorization rules are defined separately using DefaultThreadStoreAuth,
    which takes a userId and role (e.g., "editor") to control access permissions.
  - The `DefaultThreadStoreAuth` class requires a user ID and a role parameter ("comment"
    or "editor") to define authorization rules for comment interactions. The ThreadStoreAuth
    instance controls which UI options are shown but does not provide server-side
    security; server-side validation must be implemented separately.
