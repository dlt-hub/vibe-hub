auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/dvp/latest/:
  - 'Docker Hub APIs use bearer token authentication in JWT format. To authenticate,
    send a POST request to /v2/users/login with a JSON body containing username and
    password fields, and use the returned token in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer {TOKEN}".'
  - 'Docker Hub uses JWT bearer token authentication. After initial login via `/v2/users/login`,
    users receive a JWT token in the response body under the "token" field. This token
    is then used in subsequent API requests by including it in the HTTP Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}`. For accounts with 2FA enabled, a second
    call to `/v2/users/2fa-login` is required, passing the intermediate `login_2fa_token`
    and a Time-based One-Time Password `code` in the request body to obtain the final
    bearer token.'
- information_source; https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.45/:
  - Authentication for registries is handled client-side by sending registry credentials
    as a base64url-encoded JSON object in the `X-Registry-Auth` header. The JSON must
    contain either username/password/serveraddress fields, or an identitytoken field
    obtained from the `/auth` endpoint.
  - The API uses base64url-encoded registry credentials passed via the X-Registry-Auth
    header for authentication when installing plugins. This header contains authentication
    information needed to pull the plugin from a registry.
  - The `X-Registry-Auth` header is required for updating a service and must contain
    a base64url-encoded authentication token for registry access.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (page number)
    and page_size (number of items per page). The response includes count (total items),
    next (URL for next page or null), previous (URL for previous page or null), and
    results (array of items). Stop paginating when next is null.
