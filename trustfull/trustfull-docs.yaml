notes:
- Each request requires a different customer_id
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Accessing the datasets requires an active AWS account with credentials issued by
  Trustfull.
- These credentials include an AWS Access Key and Secret Key, which will be provided
  separately via email and SMS.
- Always create a unique Session ID for every user session.
- Trigger submission at meaningful moments.
- max_enrichment_time is optional and can be omitted if the use case is not time-sensitive.
- Setting a max_enrichment_time lower than the recommended value (for any product
  or solution) will greatly affect the accuracy of the score.
- Graph provides a holistic view of a user's digital footprint by linking diverse
  identifiers.
- Real-time alerts when it detects suspicious activities or deviations from normal
  user behavior.
- In the API request, different touchpoint values will no longer be supported for
  the same customer_id.
- This section contains a reference to a full list of parameters returned by Trustfull.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'Missing JS-KEY: Be sure you have code that includes your JS-KEY in the Trustfull
  init call.'
- '400: Invalid customer_id provided'
- '401: Unauthorized - API key is either incorrect or not enabled'
- '400: The request was not processed because it contained formal errors.'
- '403: The request was not processed because there was an issue with the authentication'
- '401: This may happen if you correctly populated the API key field but the key is
  either incorrect or not enabled.'
- '402: API key used has no available credit'
- '429: Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time'
- '500: This is a generic error indicating a server-side problem.'
- '504: Gateway timeout, the server took too much time to response and closed the
  connection.'
