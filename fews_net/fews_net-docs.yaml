auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.fews.net/fdw/fews-net-api:
  - 'The FDW REST API supports two authentication methods. Session Authentication
    uses a POST request to /accounts/login/ with username and password, returning
    a session cookie for subsequent requests. Token Authentication uses a POST request
    to /api-token-auth/ with username and password, returning a JWT token that can
    be sent as an HTTP header Authorization: JWT <token> or as a query parameter ?jwt=<token>.
    Requests without authentication may succeed but return only public data.'
- information_source; https://help.fews.net/fde/v1/fews-net-api:
  - 'JWT token authentication is required, provided either in the Authorization header
    as `Authorization: JWT <token>` or as a query parameter `?jwt=<token>`. Requests
    without authentication may succeed but return only public data. For Excel refreshable
    links, use Basic authentication with FDW login credentials (username and password);
    single sign-on credentials are not supported.'
  - 'The FEWS NET API supports two authentication methods. Session Authentication
    uses a POST request with username and password to /accounts/login/ to receive
    a session cookie for subsequent requests. Token Authentication uses a POST request
    with username and password to /api-token-auth/ to receive a JSON response containing

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.fews.net/fdw/fews-net-api:
  - Pagination uses page_size (number of records per page) and offset (starting record
    position) as query parameters. The JSON response includes a count field (total
    records), next field (URL for the next page), previous field (URL for the previous
    page), and results array containing the paginated data. Stop paginating when next
    is null.
- information_source; https://help.fews.net/fde/v1/fews-net-api:
  - Pagination uses offset and page_size query parameters. The response includes a
    count field for total results, a next field with the URL for the next page (or
    null when no more pages exist), and a previous field. To paginate, extract the
    next URL from the response and use it for the subsequent request, or increment
    offset by page_size while keeping page_size constant.
  - Use page_size and offset query parameters for JSON responses. page_size specifies
    records per page, offset specifies the starting record index. Response includes
    total field indicating total record count.
