notes:
- Major versions of Turborepo will be supported for two years from the release date
  of the next major version.
- Remote Caching is a powerful feature of Turborepo, but, with great power, comes
  great responsibility.
- Make sure you are caching correctly first and double check handling of environment
  variables.
- Collection of telemetry data is optional.
- We DO NOT collect any metrics which may contain sensitive data.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- For now, the only valid value for the extends key is ["//"].
- Turborepo uses your repository's lockfile to determine caching behavior.
- 'Good to know: `-F` is an alias for `--filter`.'
- 'Good to know: This will also run the task''s dependencies.'
- The same behavior can also be set via the TURBO_DAEMON=true system variable.
- Profiles can be viewed in a tool like Perfetto.
- Caching tasks with Watch Mode is currently experimental, under the --experimental-write-cache
  flag.
- Defaults to false.
- Customize the directory the pruned output is generated in.
- This feature is experimental, and we're looking for your feedback.
- List packages in your monorepo.
- Turborepo assumes that your tasks are deterministic.
- Turborepo does not support nested packages due to ambiguous behavior among package
  managers.
- Turborepo does not manage dependencies, leaving that work up to your package manager
  of choice.
- One 'purpose' per package recommended.
- Application Packages do not contain shared code.
- Turborepo will always parallelize any work that it can to ensure everything runs
  as fast as possible.
- Uses a dev task configuration with persistent and no cache.
- Remote Caching is enabled through environment variables.
- When using GitHub Actions, it can determine changes in PRs.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
