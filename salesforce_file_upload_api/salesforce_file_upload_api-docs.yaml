auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.appseconnect.com/salesforce-file-upload-api/:
  - OAuth 2.0 is required to authenticate to the Salesforce REST API. You must create
    a connected app in Salesforce, generate a token from the Salesforce UI, and use
    that token to access resources during file uploads.
- information_source; https://www.appseconnect.com/how-to-connect-salesforce-and-postman-using-rest-api/:
  - Salesforce uses OAuth 2.0 with a password grant flow. Send a POST request to https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
    with form-data parameters grant_type, client_id, client_secret, username, and
    password. The response includes an access_token that must be sent in the Authorization
    header as Bearer {{access_token}} for all subsequent API requests.
