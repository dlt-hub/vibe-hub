notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The plusserver S3 service’s Tenant API provides a comprehensive interface for various
  functions to effectively control and manage tenant management.
- You need to use your own login credentials and account IDs to make the API requests.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Inaccurate display of consumption data in Horizon
- Can not login to newly launched instance
- Unable to log in
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in pluscloud
- Some endpoints may have rate limiting
- Data centers in an AZ share at least one common power, network, and cooling supply.
- Network latency between the AZs within the same region is <=2ms.
- scs1 (deprecated) and scs2 are development environments provided exclusively in
  the context of Sovereign Cloud Stack & Gaia-X.
- The default security group allows all outgoing traffic and enables SSH access to
  the VM.
- Incoming traffic is denied by default, except for traffic from systems in the same
  security group.
- SSH access is enabled in the default security group, so it’s important to review
  and adjust the security group rules to ensure the desired level of security for
  your VMs.
- Storage within a pluscloud open environment is high available
- Local SSD Storage has the same lifecycle as the VM instance.
- Object Storage on pluscloud open is designed for moderate amounts of data and file
  storage needs.
- The display of consumption data in the Horizon Dashboard does not match the billing
  data.
- You have started a new instance, but are unable to login with your PuTTY-generated
  SSH key.
- You received your initial credentials via e-mail and are trying to log in to Horizon,
  but it’s not working.
- PuTTY and PuTTYgen use a different format for generating SSH keypairs than OpenStack.
- SSH key pairs used in OpenStack and Linux should be saved in OpenSSH format.
- Login issues may arise due to various known problems.
- A whitespace may have been added to your password unnoticed when copying.
- Scheduled maintenance windows usually take place every day after 22:00 CEST.
- A normal restart of the hypervisor takes about 15 minutes, but can take longer in
  exceptional cases.
- Most applications have no problems with live migration.
- Menu 'Instances' shows details about all your virtual machines and their current
  state.
- Shell access to the new instance is only possible via SSH key authentication.
- Regular Compute Flavors with disks are now deprecated in favor to diskless Flavors
  to avoid confusion with Local SSD Storage (indicated by an ’s’ after the disk size).
- As a certified Souvereing Cloud Stack, we implement the latest Compute Flavor specifications.
  Part of the lifecycle management is also to deprecate old Compute Flavors.
- The external network is configured by the provider and cannot be changed.
- Policies can only be changed with the Openstack CLI and not with the GUI.
- Taking a snapshot of a volume that is mounted and in use may result in data corruption.
- The web GUI does not allow the creation of encrypted root volumes.
- Local SSD Storage shares the same lifecycle as the VM instance.
- If the VM is deleted or crashes the Local SSD Storage data will be lost as well.
- You should take regular snapshots to be able to restore a failed VM in the event
  of a hardware failure of the underlying hypervisor.
- Objects can be uploaded, copied, edited and deleted in containers/buckets.
- Subfolders are not like subfolders in a file system. The folder structure is only
  simulated by adding “/” to the folder name.
- Only supports setting temporary URL keys at the account level and not at the container
  level.
- Requires a Consul cluster for coordination and management.
- Patroni needs a configuration file in YAML format.
- The CA we just created is valid for one year. Thus after one year the certificate
  has to be renewed.
- Please set your own password for Grafana!
- If you plan to use this in a production setup, make sure to add the option `--allowed-cidr`
  during the creation of the listener.
- It is not possible to change storage classes by resizing an instance. Thus you cannot
  change from ceph storage to local-ssd storage by changing the flavor from SCS-2V-4-20
  to SCS-2V-4-20s.
- User IDs and group IDs must be identical on all instances for multiple mounts
- Default mount options can be seen with 'sudo cat /proc/mounts | grep nfs'
- VM tends to pickup different IPs if not assigned statically.
- The floating IPs will be detached from VM but they will remain assigned to port
  in the project.
- The floating IPs are billed as long as they are part of the project they need to
  be removed from the project if not desired.
- Requires the creation of a key pair for SSH access.
- User must allocate a floating IP to access the instance.
- 'Last modified 17.09.2024: Changed release notes (5acf505)'
- Change initial password for security reasons.
- PSMANAGED rules must be retained for proper service functionality.
- VMs created from templates save time and effort during provisioning.
- Backup jobs can be scheduled within a specific time window.
- Environments marked with an asterisk (*) are solely available to existing customers.
- VLAN bridging can currently only be set up by plusserver employees.
- This means that there is no guarantee of specific availability, bandwidth or latency
  for this service.
- Only the specified vRAM range is supported.
- You can also set values outside the specified range. In this case, however, it may
  happen that a VM does not start or no longer starts correctly after a restart.
- The allocated vRAM of a VM also consumes corresponding storage space. This is because
  in the event that an ESXi no longer has enough physical RAM available, a correspondingly
  large swap file is required for each VM in the size of its configured RAM.
- All vCores of a VM have the same clock speed.
- All VMs of a OrgVDC use the same type of vCPU.
- Proportional configuration of vCPUs is not possible.
- There is no entitlement to a specific CPU model or a specific manufacturer.
- For this process your user must be an Organization Administrator.
- If you have already set up federation with an Identity Provider, generating new
  certificates will disable the current connection.
- This will cause users who use your Identity Provider to no longer be able to authenticate,
  until the federation is reconfigured with the new certificates!
- Each organization is provided a set of SAML certificates, enabling you to use an
  identity provider of your choice for SSO.
- Typically these remain valid for an entire year.
- For each connection type, you’ll need to configure the IP addresses for both endpoints
  and establish a shared secret.
- Specify which Virtual Data Center (VDC) networks are permitted to use the VPN link.
- SSH Public Key must be provided for access
- Username depends on the operating system chosen
- Always choose a RAID level with redundancies, as we proactively replace defective
  hard drives.
- 'Last modified 12.11.2024: Changing to new picture schema, removing aws docs, adding
  new screenshots (8887530)'
- With this release plan, we would like to offer you more transparency and planning
  security with regard to upcoming updates and changes to our products and services.
- This allows you to prepare for important updates in good time and ensure that your
  systems and processes run smoothly.
- PSKE always supports the latest 3 versions of Kubernetes (supported by SAP Gardener).
- Older versions of Kubernetes are periodically retired to meet these requirements.
- Updates are carried out automatically within the defined maintenance window.
- The exact time of the update within the maintenance window can be determined by
  the customer.
- Updates are only carried out after the currently used version has expired.
- The update is usually performed at midnight.
- Enforced upgrades are carried out regardless of whether AutoUpdates are activated
  or deactivated.
- Enforced upgrades are performed as soon as possible after the new version is available.
- Quotas can be set using the OpenStack command-line interface or the OpenStack dashboard.
- Quotas are an important part of OpenStack resource management.
- Enables the Proxy Protocol in the OpenStack LoadBalancer
- Additional supported service annotations can be found in the official GitHub project
- Misconfigurations in the Shoot Spec can cause errors or even make the cluster inoperable.
- The default setting in the clusters is 'horizontal'.
- NodeLocalDNS reduces the latency of DNS queries.
- Do not manually modify nodes that are part of an autoscaling group. All nodes in
  the same node group should have the same capacity and labels.
- Use requests for containers/pods.
- Use PodDisruptionBudgets to prevent pods from being deleted too abruptly (if needed).
- Ensure that your cloud provider’s quota is sufficient before setting the min/max
  values for the Horizontal Node Autoscaler.
- Avoid using additional Node Group Autoscalers (even from your cloud provider).
- The networking.pods IP configuration is immutable and cannot be changed afterwards.
- The nodeCIDRMaskSize configuration is immutable and cannot be changed afterwards.
- Some requests may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- If you want to create the cluster with Terraform and don’t want to delete it using
  Terraform, you don’t need to adjust anything else in the definition.
- The master/control plane nodes are not configurable by you because they are managed
  by Gardener.
- Updates can be controlled for automatic application using the “Auto Update” option.
- The hibernation feature allows you to put one or more PSKE clusters into hibernation
  mode automatically or with the push of a button to save money on cloud resources
  that are not needed 24/7.
- The start and end points follow the familiar Cron syntax from the Crontab in the
  Unix/Linux world.
- If you have monitoring enabled in your cluster, you can access the Grafana credentials
  through the project and the corresponding cluster by following specific steps.
- HPA works only with stateless applications capable of replication or Stateful Sets
  that allow for persistence.
- HPA doesn’t work with Daemon Sets.
- If the limits for pod metrics are not set efficiently, pods may be terminated frequently
  or resources may be wasted.
- HPA cannot be used in conjunction with VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) based on the
  same metrics.
- HPA cannot scale if the total cluster capacity is exhausted until new nodes are
  added to the cluster.
- 'The VPA allows two types of resources to be specified for each container within
  a Pod: Requests and Limits.'
- VPA cannot be used alongside HPA based on the same metrics.
- VPA can recommend more resources than are available in the cluster, resulting in
  Pods not being assigned to nodes due to insufficient resources.
- The “encrypted” StorageClass ensures that the volume created on OpenStack is encrypted
  with LUKS.
- default (default) is the default StorageClass and is used if no explicit StorageClass
  is specified in the PersistentVolumeClaim.
- The 'cinder.csi.openstack.org' provisioner only supports the 'ReadWriteOnce' access
  mode.
- To order 'plusstorage NFS (v2)', please contact our Sales-Team.
- The ‘plusstorage NFS (v2)’ product is required.
- NFS_IP and SUBPATH will be provided to you from our side.
- To resolve this issue, you must add an additional annotation to the Load Balancer
  service.
- This issue was fixed in the upstream Kubernetes project for v1.20, but was later
  reverted.
- There is an open issue that addresses the Load Balancer issue in v1.28.
- 'The following lines must be added to the ConfigMap of the Ingress Controller: use-proxy-protocol:
  "true", use-forwarded-headers: "true"'
- 'An annotation must be added to the associated load balancer service for the NGINX
  Ingress Controller: loadbalancer.openstack.org/proxy-protocol: "true"'
- Now applications within the Kubernetes cluster can view the external IP address
  of external web requests.
- If the annotation openstack-internal-load-balancer has been set, any free IP address
  from the node network (default 10.250.0.0/16) of the respective PSKE cluster can
  be used.
- 'For an internal load balancer (openstack-internal-load-balancer: true), the private
  IPv4 address within the cluster network is defined here.'
- Anonymous Request are deprecated. However, they will continue to work for a while.
- By default you can only download kubeconfigs with a maximum lifetime of 24h from
  the Gardener Dashboard.
- Create a values.yaml file with the specified key/value pairs.
- You need to add the Helm repository or update it if it’s already added.
- Ensure that the software versions and IP addresses are up to date and correctly
  represent the environment.
- Ensure that the webpage data persists across pod restarts using PersistentVolumeClaim.
- Create an index.html file within the PersistentVolume to avoid a '403 - Forbidden'
  error.
- Annotation loadbalancer.openstack.org/keep-floatingip must be set to false to release
  the FloatingIP.
- The default ramp-down time is 5 minutes. This means that reducing the load will
  not immediately result in a decrease in replicas for approximately 5 minutes (+-
  15 seconds) as acknowledged by the VPA.
- The default timeout for OpenStack LoadBalancers is 30 seconds.
- timeout-client-data defines how long the LoadBalancer waits for data from the client
  (in milliseconds).
- timeout-member-data defines how long the LoadBalancer waits for data from the backend
  (member) (also in milliseconds).
- 2FA is activated for the realm.
- User must have verified email for authentication workflow.
- Some objects may have specific restrictions on data retrieval.
- Static Token Kubeconfig doesn’t get enabled by default anymore
- The data disk size can only be increased. To reduce the disk size, you must create
  a new instance and transfer the data manually.
- The service is accessible via a public IP. Initially block all access to the service.
  Specify the trusted sources from which the Private Registry should be accessible.
- Make sure to only allow known Source IP Addresses that your applications use.
- We require secure, encrypted communication from the client/application to our DBaaS.
- Parameters marked with an asterisk (*) are dynamically calculated based on available
  compute resources, allowing for seamless vertical scaling.
- Changing the Node Size will cause a short interruption of the service as the node
  is rolled out again with adjusted resources.
- The data disk size can only be increased. To reduce the disk size, you must create
  a new DBaaS instance and transfer the data manually.
- Read Replicas are available for DBaas MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- You can create a maximum of three additional read replicas per DBaaS.
- Compute ressources and data storage size needs to be equal to the origin DBaaS.
- It is not possible to convert a secondary server into a primary server to enable
  write access.
- Cascading configurations, where a secondary server acts as a source for another
  secondary server, are not supported.
- The service is accessible via a public IP and initially blocks all access.
- Requires setup of connected app in plusserver
- If you encounter errors during the import or need configuration adjustments, please
  open a ticket.
- The service is accessible via a public IP.
- You must enable access from one or more external addresses or address ranges.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in plusserver
- Service is initially blocked from all access and requires specifying trusted sources.
- You must enable access from one or more external addresses.
- Daily automatic backups with a default retention period of 7 days.
- Ensures data encryption for enhanced security.
- For custom DBaaS configurations including parameters not listed above, please submit
  a support ticket to our team.
- We’re working on a feature to let you directly modify configuration parameters in
  our customer portal. Until then we thank you for your patience as we improve our
  services.
- Use the admin password retrieved from the customer portal to connect to PostgreSQL.
- Initially block all access to the service.
- Changes to the configuration of the Virtual Cloud Firewall should always be tested
  in a non-production environment before being implemented in production to avoid
  disruptions.
- This is constantly being further developed, so the major version currently in use
  should always be updated to the latest minor version released, especially with regard
  to security vulnerabilities. This often also provides additional improvements from
  the manufacturer.
- The Virtual Cloud Firewall configurations should be backed up regularly to prevent
  data loss in the event of failures.
- This is constantly being further developed, so the major version currently in use
  should always be updated to the latest minor version released, especially with regard
  to security vulnerabilities.
- The Virtual Cloud Firewall configurations should be backed up regularly to prevent
  data loss in the event of failures. This backup is already included in the product.
- Use network segmentation and security zones effectively to control data traffic
  and increase security.
- Enter your login details under 'Add or select credentials issued to you by the service
  provider'.
- To ensure optimal performance for your bucket, please select the appropriate endpoint
  from the table when retrieving data.
- A minimum billing size of 128 KB is applied for small objects.
- S3 storage classes are determined by the bucket name.

- The security recommendation is to create a new user to replace the root user. The
  root user should only be used in emergencies.
- Please be cautious when setting permissions and ensure that users only receive the
  necessary rights to ensure the security of your data.
- The example policy grants users comprehensive access rights to S3 resources. Before
  applying this policy, please ensure that you limit your users’ rights to the necessary
  minimum to ensure the security and protection of your data.
- Allows for seamless integration of existing user and group management into the StorageGrid
  system.
- The AWS CLI uses 'http://s3.amazonaws.com' as the default endpoint.
- Configuration file locations vary by operating system.
- Every S3 bucket name must be unique and can exist only once globally in the plusserver
  S3 service.
- For optimal performance, an object should always be stored and accessed via the
  appropriate endpoint.
- 'For more information, refer to: Using S3 commands managing objects copy'
- Meta information is NEVER encrypted.
- Objects uploaded with SSE-C cannot be downloaded via the web interface.
- Correct handling of version IDs is important to ensure that you delete the desired
  version of an object.
- Ensure that the respective bucket has both versioning and Object Lock enabled to
  utilize this feature.
- Objects in Compliance mode cannot be deleted or modified as long as the retention
  period is active.
- Once locked, objects cannot be deleted or modified during the specified retention
  period.
- Users cannot independently delete Compliance-locked objects, providing an additional
  layer of protection for critical data.
- In Governance mode, certain user actions can be performed, which are typically not
  allowed in Compliance mode.
- Users with the required permissions can delete locked objects in Governance mode,
  but an audit trail of such actions is retained.
- These permissions grant powerful actions that can impact the integrity and immutability
  of data. Assign these permissions with caution and ensure that only trusted users
  have access to them.
- It is advisable to carefully plan your permission structure, ensuring that users
  only receive the permissions they truly need to perform security-related actions.
- Both Compliance and Governance Object Lock ensure the integrity and immutability
  of data.
- As long as at least one locked object is within a bucket, the bucket cannot be deleted.
- Termination of the plusserver S3 contract is not possible as long as locked objects
  still exist in the customer account.
- Combining Object Lock and Versioning allows you to apply different protection measures
  to various versions of the same object.
- By setting a bucket to 'Read Only,' you can restrict the ability to create or edit
  objects in the bucket while still allowing the retrieval of existing objects.
- Policies are defined using .json objects.
- By default, the validity period of the link generated by the presign command is
  7 days.
- Default is 3600 seconds. Maximum is 604800 seconds.
- 'Example of cron job to sync every hour: 0 * * * * aws s3 sync s3://my-source-bucket

- Ensure comprehensive support for modern S3 features by using the latest version
  of rclone
- 'Basic syntax of rclone: rclone [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>'
- By default, the script uses ',' as the delimiter and 'buckets.csv' as the CSV file.
- Uses Minio and jq for migration.
- Ensure that all objects you want to migrate have valid Object-Lock information.
- Starting from Veeam Backup & Replication 11a, the 'ListAllMyBuckets' permission
  is no longer required if you manually enter the bucket name in the 'Bucket' step
  of the new object repository wizard.
- We require secure, encrypted communication from the client/application to our Keycloak
  as a Service instance.
