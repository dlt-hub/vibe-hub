notes:
- Most of their sounds come from sampling off of vinyl, so the crackle is part of
  the audio signal that was sampled.
- There are ways to sound less 'on top' and more congruent through mixing technique
  using plugins or more random vinyl crackle samples (worth learning!), but if you
  really want to get that sound, crate dig vinyl like crazy, amass a wealth of vinyl-based
  samples, and use those in your compositions.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- MIDI over USB is faster than MIDI over DIN by at least an order of magnitude (or
  2).
- USB Audio can also appear slow if the OS or application you are using isn't prioritizing
  it enough.
- USB MIDI is roughly 16 times faster than MIDI DIN under high bandwidth circumstances.
- Packets are sent every 1ms, with up to 1ms of jitter over USB.
- USB midi doesn't care as long as it fits the USB pipe.
- Any bandwidth throttling that is needed for the DIN port on a USB interface needs
  to be done before the data enters the USB midi transport system.
- mioXx can't 'see' a NDLR connected to the USB port. It will power it, but the NDLR
  does not correctly declare itself (in terms of USB metadata), so the only option
  is to use DIN on the mioX.
- Uses RTP for MIDI connectivity.
- Some users experience stuck notes or MIDI timing issues with RTP.
- There are stability issues with the Windows Auracle app - it can lose sight of the
  connected devices.
- Utilizes VNC for remote desktop functionality.
- Systems can switch between LAN and WAN.
- Confusion about the differences between the remastered versions of Loveless.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication for all requests.
- Some people believe the discs have been mislabeled.
- There is a glitch on one of the tracks ('What You Want', around 02:46) on CD 1.
