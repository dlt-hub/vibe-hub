    grant types: CODE (requires client ID and client secret, for web servers), TOKEN/IMPLICIT
    (for browser/mobile apps without secure secret storage), or CLIENT-CREDENTIALS
    (for non-user contexts, requiring roleIds assignment). Authentication tokens are
    generated using the OAuth Grant/Client credentials to access PureCloud.'
  - OAuth2 token is required for the message and reaction ingestion endpoints. The
    token must be generated using OAuth client credentials flow and must include at

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/digital/webmessaging/websocketapi:
  - Use query parameters pageSize and pageNumber to paginate through message history
    via GET /api/v2/webmessaging/messages. The response returns message entities in
    an array; construct subsequent requests by incrementing pageNumber while keeping
    pageSize constant.
- information_source; https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/api-explorer:
  - Gets a paged list of alerts. Query parameter limit controls page size with maximum
    of 50. Response includes pagination fields to navigate through results, though
    exact field names are not specified in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination is used with cursor-based navigation on the /api/v2/authorization/divisions/query
    endpoint. Use the "after" parameter to fetch the next page and "before" parameter
    to fetch the previous page.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach via the `nextUri` field in the response.
    Clients should continue sending requests using the `nextUri` value until it is
    no longer present in the response, at which point all items have been returned.
    The `nextUri` is already URL encoded and should not be re-encoded.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with the 'nextUri' field in the response.
    Clients should continue sending requests using the 'nextUri' value from each response
    until 'nextUri' is no longer present, indicating all items have been returned.
    The 'nextUri' is already URL encoded and should not be encoded again.
