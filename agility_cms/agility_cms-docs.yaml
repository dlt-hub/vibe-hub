auth_info:
- information_source; https://agilitycms.com/docs/developers/content-fetch-api:
  - API Key authentication is required and must be passed as part of the URL path.
    All requests follow the pattern https://api.aglty.io/{guid}/{apitype}/{locale}/{requestType}/{requestParams},
    where guid is the API Key identifier. The API Key is included directly in the
    URL path rather than as a header or query parameter.
  - 'API Key authentication is required in the header for each REST API request. The
    API Key is a secret credential retrieved from Settings > API Keys and must be
    included in request headers. API Keys support two types: preview (for previewing
    content) and fetch (for published content only), and may have optional expiry
    dates. The base API URL format is https://api.aglty.io/{guid}/{apitype}, with
    regional alternatives available for Canada, Europe, and Australia.'
  - 'API Keys are required for authentication. Retrieve your API Key from Agility
    Settings > API Keys, then include it in the APIKey header of your HTTP request.
    The header format is "APIKey: <your-api-key-value>".'
  - Whether you are hitting the Content Fetch REST API over HTTP directly or through
    an SDK, you need to authenticate your requests using API Keys found under Settings
    > API Keys. The API URL is the base endpoint where requests are sent, and some
    SDKs will resolve this automatically. All requests use GET methods and return
    JSON responses.
- information_source; https://agilitycms.com/docs/developers/content-sync-api:
  - API Key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `APIKey` header with
    each request to the Sync API endpoint. The first sync call uses `syncToken=0`,
    and subsequent calls use the `syncToken` value returned from the previous response
    to fetch only changed content incrementally.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://agilitycms.com/docs/developers/content-fetch-api:
  - Sync Content Items and Sync Pages methods use paged format pagination. Each request
    returns a syncToken that must be persisted and passed into subsequent requests
    to maintain sync state and retrieve the next page of results.
- information_source; https://agilitycms.com/docs/developers/content-sync-api:
  - The Sync API uses token-based pagination with syncToken and pageSize parameters.
    The syncToken query parameter (starting at 0) identifies the current page, while
    pageSize (max 500) controls results per request. The response provides the next
    syncToken to use; pagination is complete when syncToken equals 0 or no results
    are returned.
