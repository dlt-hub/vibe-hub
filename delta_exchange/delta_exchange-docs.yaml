auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.delta.exchange/:
  - 'API authentication requires three headers: api-key (your API key), signature
    (HMAC signature of the request), and timestamp (request timestamp). These must
    be included in every request to the API.'
  - 'API key and signature-based authentication. Send three required headers with
    every request: api-key (your API key), signature (HMAC signature of the request),
    and timestamp (request timestamp). The signature and timestamp are used to verify
    request authenticity and prevent replay attacks.'
  - API key authentication is required. Include the api-key header with your API key
    in requests, and implement signature generation logic (likely HMAC-based given
    the api_secret parameter is stored but not shown in the headers).
  - 'API requests must be signed using an API key and secret. Three headers are required:
    api-key (your API key), signature (HMAC signature of the request), and timestamp
    (request timestamp). See the Authentication section for details on how to generate
    the signature.'
  - 'API requests require three authentication headers: api-key (your API key), signature
    (HMAC signature of the request), and timestamp (request timestamp). The signature
    must be computed using your API secret according to the Authentication section
    details.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.delta.exchange/:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used across all APIs that support pagination. The response
    meta object contains an "after" cursor field for fetching the next page; use this
    cursor value in subsequent requests to retrieve paginated data. Stop paginating
    when no "after" cursor is returned.
  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before parameters. The response meta object
    contains after and before cursors; use the after value as the after query parameter
    in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before query parameters (optional strings)
    to navigate forward and backward through results, with page_size query parameter
    (optional integer) controlling records returned per page.
  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before query parameters (optional strings)
    to navigate pages; page_size query parameter (optional integer) specifies records
    per page; cursors become null when no next or previous page exists.
  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before query parameters to navigate pages,
    with page_size (default 100) controlling results per page. The response likely
    contains cursor values to construct subsequent requests.
