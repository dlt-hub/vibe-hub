notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Joule has a low latency read mechanism to overcome limitation using in-memory caching.
- Joule does not differentiate between batch or stream processing
- Batch jobs can also include real-time triggers, allowing them to operate seamlessly
  alongside streaming data
- Joule connects seamlessly to a variety of event sources, enabling continuous or
  periodic data ingestion.
- Joule’s unified engine enables seamless integration of batch and stream processing
  within a single platform.
- Joule requires Graalvm to be installed
- Postman is installed
- Docker or any other alternative to run containers
- Git is installed
- The banking demo provides a quote simulator that publishes to the quotes topic.
- Provide trading consumer applications with bid and ask quotes and company information
  for all major banks with a market cap of over $350 billion trading on the nasdaq
  stock market.
- Use case processes for a single defined market business week.
- Events sent to a Kafka topic and a persistent parquet file.
- Process for a single defined market business week from '2024-10-01T09:25:00.000Z'
  to '2024-10-05T16:35:00.000Z'.
- Filter events by 'Major Banks' industry.
- The use case should only be processing for a single defined market business week.
- Events to be sent to a Kafka topic and a persistent parquet file using the same
  data format.
- Processors can be combined flexibly into pipelines, allowing custom configurations
  for specific use cases.
- Events are processed sequentially and in real time, supporting high-speed, low-latency
  applications.
- Requires setup of connected app in Joule
- 'Automated metrics monitor for Joule pipelines: data pipelines, processors, transport,
  storage'
- Joulectl allows you to manage the entire usecase lifecycle which includes deployment,
  getting status, runtime management, and undeployment.
- Ideal for lightweight or localized use cases
- Can be deployed using modern container technology or traditional installation package
- Suitable for edge based lightweight and IoT
- This feature is currently in beta version as of May 2025.
- 'Only two components are required: Joulectl and Joule Runtime'
- GuardianDB is an optional component useful for production ready Joule process
- New and improved documentation
- Fixed duplicate events being emitted from an analytic window processing
- Optimised and improved AVRO record handling
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
