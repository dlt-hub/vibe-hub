auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.inevent.com:
  - 'Authentication requires three query parameters sent with the POST request to
    https://api.inevent.com/: tokenID (your authentication token), eventID (the target
    event identifier), and key (your API key). All three must be included as query
    string parameters in the request URL.'
  - The API uses token-based authentication via query parameters. Include tokenID
    and eventID as query parameters in all requests (both GET and POST). The tokenID
    serves as the authentication token and must be passed as tokenID=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
    in the query string.

  - 'Authentication requires three query parameters sent with every POST request to
    https://api.inevent.com/: tokenID (your authentication token), eventID (the event
    identifier), and key (your API key). These credentials must be passed as query
    string parameters in the URL.'
  - Authentication to the InEvent API uses a token-based query parameter approach.
    Include the tokenID query parameter in all requests (both GET and POST) along
    with the eventID parameter; the tokenID serves as your authentication credential
    and must be passed as a URL query parameter named tokenID.
- information_source; https://developers.inevent.com/event-api/creating-events:
  - You must have a System scope access token. The tokenID and companyID are required
    query attributes. Pass the tokenID as a query parameter in the request URL along
    with companyID to authenticate and authorize access to create events in the company
    environment.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.inevent.com/event-api/listing-events:
  - To paginate, use query parameters limit (page size) and offset (starting position).
    Send paginated=1 to receive total event count in the response for building pagination
    UI. Stop paginating when the number of returned results is less than the limit
    value.
