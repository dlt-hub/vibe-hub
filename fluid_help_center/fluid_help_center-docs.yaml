auth_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.fluid.work/en/articles/4097282:
  - An Authorization header with a bearer token is required for client authorization
    in REST API requests.
  - Basic authentication is used with a personal access token. The Authorization header
    must be set to "Basic" followed by a Base64-encoded string of the format ":{personalaccesstoken}",
    where the username portion is empty and the token is the personal access token
    value.
  - 'Personal access tokens (PATs) are used for authentication. They can be provided
    either via HTTP Basic Auth using the --user flag with format username:pattoken,
    or by converting the PAT to Base64 and sending it in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Basic BASE64PATSTRING". The PAT should be treated with the
    same security care as passwords.'
  - The Fluid REST API requires basic authentication using a username and a Personal
    Access Token (PAT). The PAT serves as your security credential and identifies
    you, your accessible organizations, and access scopes. You must treat PATs with
    the same security care as passwords. For details on generating a PAT, refer to
    the KB article on Creating a Personal Access Token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://knowledge.fluid.work/en/articles/4097282:
  - Use query parameters skip and take to paginate. The skip parameter specifies how
    many items to skip (default 0), and take specifies how many items to return per
    page (maximum 50). Response headers Item-Count and Total-Count indicate the current
    number of items returned and total count of all items respectively; continue requesting
    with incremented skip values until all results are retrieved.
