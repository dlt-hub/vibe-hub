auth_info:
- information_source; https://ocean.cognisantmd.com/public/apiDocs.html:
  - Encrypted patient data is transmitted as a JSON byte array with decryption parameters
    passed as HTTP headers. The required headers are Content-Type (must be 'application/json'),
    iv (initialization vector), and oneTimeKey (Base64 encoded key for decryption).
  - The API requires a site number passed as a header parameter named `siteNum` (string
    type) for session validation and credential confirmation. This header must be
    included in requests to validate Ocean API credentials.
  - 'The API uses encryption-based authentication with the following requirements:
    send a random 16-byte initialization vector (iv) and a random 16-byte one-time
    key (oneTimeKey) as required HTTP headers, along with Content-Type header set
    to ''application/json''. The request body contains base64-encoded encrypted patient
    data, and responses include encrypted data as JSON byte arrays with decryption
    values provided in HTTP headers.'
- information_source; https://ocean.cognisantmd.com/public/fhirApiDocs.html:
  - OAuth2 authentication is required for these endpoints. Credentials should be passed
    as bearer tokens in the Authorization header. The specific OAuth2 flow details,
    scopes, and token endpoint are referenced in the main Authentication section but
    not fully detailed in this excerpt.
  - Ocean API uses OAuth2 with client_credentials flow. Obtain a bearer token by sending
    clientId and secret to /svc/oauth2/token, then include the token in the Authorization
    HTTP header of every API call. Tokens expire in 5 minutes and are site-specific.
