notes:
- Source URL field is nullable and may not always be present in the payload.
- Field 'sourceURL' is always null in 'Contact created' event.
- Documentation provides example payload but not clear API endpoint or authentication
  details
- The webhook documentation does not specify authentication requirements, assuming
  none is needed.
- Over time, the list of events will change and be supplemented
- Different versions of the same events are supported to maintain backward compatibility
- Webhooks use secret token for verification of the source.
- 'Webhook retry strategy: initial 4s delay, doubling thereafter, max delay 1 day,
  max retries 12, max total resend time roughly 5 days'
- Automatic deactivation of subscriptions if successful delivery rate drops below
  80% over the last five days
- Contacts are not immediately removed upon deletion; actual deletion may take several
  days
- Adding a new contact with an email of a recently deleted contact might inherit certain
  properties
- API key must be kept secure and not exposed on client-side to prevent security risks.
- Implements cursor-based pagination for efficient data retrieval.
errors:
- General: Check out the SystemeIO help
- If unable to accept webhooks, ensure endpoint is publicly accessible, can accept
  POST requests, and is subscribed to relevant events
- REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency
- 429 Too Many Requests: Implement retry logic with delay indicated in the Retry-After
    header
- 429 Too Many Requests: Consider implementing retry logic with a delay based on the
    Retry-After header
- 429 Too Many Requests: Observe rate limits and use Retry-After header for handling
    retries.
