  and delivery of Web applications on mobile devices.
- The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of mobile
  Web sites.
- Applications should endeavor to remain functional even if cookies are unavailable.
- Use of client-side storage in Web applications is a powerful technique that brings
  Web applications into parity with native applications in terms of start-up time
  and responsiveness.
- Data that needs to be shared with other devices or recovered in the case of a lost
  or damaged device, should be replicated back to the server as soon as possible.
- These APIs should be used with caution.
- Ensure that the user is informed if the application needs to access personal or
  device information.
- If automatic sign-in is enabled, a sign-out link should also be provided.
- Compress content for efficient delivery.
- Smaller applications will download and execute more quickly and more reliably than
  larger ones on constrained devices.
- Try not to use redirects.
- Establishing the necessary connections in order to complete an HTTP request can
  take significantly longer on a mobile network than on a fixed network.
- A Web application typically requires a number of resources each of which requires
  an HTTP request.
- Static resources do not need cookie information and so performance can be improved
  by serving them from a path or sub-domain for which the application's cookies are
  out of scope.
- User experience is influenced by latency, interaction method, and data consistency.
- Minimize the number of local storage queries required before the first view can
  be displayed.

- Some software may not conform to this document but still be accessible to some users
  with disabilities. Conformance is expected to be a strong indicator of accessibility,
  but it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring the accessibility
  of software.
- Some properties may raise DOMException if incorrect values are used.
- Harmonize how checkpoints use graphical user interface or graphical viewport for
  applicability.
- A conformant implementation of the CSS module is not required to implement the CSS2Properties
  interface.

- W3C may end work on a technical report at any time.
- A Group Note is published to provide a stable reference for a useful document that
  is not intended to be a formal standard.
- There are few formal requirements to publish a document as a Note or Note Draft,
  and they have no standing as a recommendation of W3C but are simply documents preserved
  for historical reference.
- The type 'aural' is now deprecated.
- This property specifies whether table headers are spoken before every cell, or only
  before a cell when that cell is associated with a different header than the previous
  cell.

- Publication of a Note by W3C does not imply endorsement by W3C, including the W3C
  Team or Membership.
- The acknowledgment of a Submission request does not imply that any action will be
  taken by W3C.
- This document is the second edition of the XHTML 1.0 specification incorporating
  the errata changes as of 1 August 2002.

- WCAG 2.2 was published on 5 October 2023.
- WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are backwards compatible with WCAG 2.2.
- This document is meant to be stable and therefore does not provide specific information
  about browser support for different technologies as that information changes rapidly.
- Implementers are strongly encouraged to use the latest version of WCAG, which is
  available from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Overview.
- Guidelines emphasize providing equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.
- Use of proper markup and style sheets is essential for accessibility.
- WCAG 2.2 is the current W3C standard and will remain so until WCAG 3 replaces it.
- UAAG 1.0 does not define any (named) conformance profiles, but rather defines the
  mechanism for creating them.
- Decoders may ignore all or some of the ancillary information.
- UAAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
  (ATAG).
- We recommend that you use UAAG 2.0.
- ATAG is technology agnostic.
- ATAG was published in 2015 and references WCAG 2.0.
- WCAG 2 is a stable, referenceable technical standard.
- 'A PNG decoder should handle errors as follows: Detect errors as early as possible
  using the PNG signature bytes and CRCs on each chunk.'
- Recover from an error, if possible; otherwise fail gracefully.
- 'Three classes of PNG chunks are relevant to this philosophy: known chunks, unknown
  critical chunks, unknown ancillary chunks.'
- A decoder that fails to check CRCs could be subject to data corruption.
- Decoders running on systems with a non-Latin-1 legacy character encoding should
  remap character codes.
- Common mistakes that are considered failures of Success Criterion 1.1.1 are listed.
- Alternative for time-based media provides a complete representation of synchronized
  media content.
- When displaying a PNG image with full alpha channel, it is important to be able
  to composite the image against some background.
- Ignoring the alpha channel will cause PNG images that have been converted from an
  associated-alpha representation to look wrong.
- Responsibility for providing captions would fall to the content providers or the
  host caller.
- Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.
- The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower.
- PNG is widely implemented in all Web browsers, image viewers, and image creation
  tools
- Animated PNG (APNG) is widely implemented in all Web browsers, and is increasingly
  available in image viewers, and animation and image creation tools
- Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology
  up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- Sample implementation available at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
- Test images can also be accessed from the PNG web site.
- Authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered.
- Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21.
- This Success Criterion ensures that all functionality of the content is operable
  through a keyboard interface.
- No additional techniques exist for this Success Criterion.
- User agents should support direct or sequential keyboard operation for all functionalities.
- This checkpoint will also benefit users of many other alternative input devices.
- This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected
  changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit.
- Timed server redirects can be found below under Common Failures.
- 'Non-timed server redirects (e.g., 3xx response codes) are not applicable because
  there is no time limit: they work instantly.'
- Interruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving
  an emergency.
- If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by pausing automatically, it may be
  necessary to pause more than once when there are multiple opportunities for time-sensitive
  user interaction.
- The requirement to pause at the *end* (rather than at the beginning) of a time-interval
  is to allow the user to review content that may change during the elapse of this
  time.
- When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without
  loss of data after re-authenticating.
- All content must meet this success criterion.
- User agents should render nothing in case of empty text equivalents.
- Conformance detail for all content is required.
- The default human language of the Web page is the default text-processing language
  as discussed in Internationalization Best Practices.
- This document provides guidelines for configuring user agent accessibility.
- Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified
  consistently.
- Many user agents offer form submission confirmation as a security feature.
- If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page
  automatically changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error
  would still need to be described to them as required by the success criterion.
- Providing information about input errors in text allows users who are blind or colorblind
  to perceive the fact that an error occurred.
- This checkpoint applies to both W3C-developed and non-W3C specifications.
- The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for all implemented specifications.
- Conformance to W3C Recommendations is not a priority 1 requirement because user
  agents can (and should!) provide access for non-W3C specifications as well.
- This document provides guidelines for user agent accessibility.
- This checkpoint involves searching through *rendered* content only.
- User agents should construct the navigation view with the goal of breaking content
  into sensible pieces according to the author's design.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious
  consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be
  reversed.
- This checkpoint refers only to cell/header relationships that the user agent can
  recognize.
- A cell may be associated with more than one header.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid consequences
  that may result from making a mistake when submitting form data.
- The user agent is not required to allow the user to override conventional bindings
  for the operating environment.
- Techniques for improving accessibility of links, lists, tables, and image maps.
- This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their
  own user interface components.
- Providing role, state, and value information on all user interface components enables
  compatibility with assistive technology.
- Conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels.
- Authors are encouraged to report progress toward meeting success criteria from all
  levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.
- User agents need to make dynamic content accessible to users who may be disoriented
  by changes in content.
- Users should be prevented from configuring the user agent in a way that would interfere
  with important functionalities.
- In Java 1.1.x, Sun's Java access utilities load an assistive by monitoring the Java
  awt.properties file for the presence of assistive technologies and loads them.
- The assistive technology has the option to either communicate with a main assistive
  technology of its own and process the document object model as a caching mechanism
  for the main assistive technology, or act as a bridge to the document object model
  for the main assistive technology.
- This document is a reference for accessibility principles and design ideas.
- Not all browsers or multimedia tools may support the features described in the guidelines.
- Some requirements depend on content roles, content relationships, timing relationships,
  and other information supplied by the author.
- This document is the gateway to a series of related documents that provide techniques
  for satisfying the requirements defined in 'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
  1.0'.
- The series of documents supersedes the 5 May 1999 W3C Note 'Techniques for Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines 1.0'.
- Uses various guidelines for software accessibility — refer to the listed resources
  for detailed information.
- The BLINK and MARQUEE elements are not defined in any W3C HTML specification and
  should not be used.
- Although this charter is available publicly, some of the links in this document
  refer to resources that require W3C Member access.
- Some software may not conform to this document but still be accessible to some users
  with disabilities.
- Conformance is expected to be a strong indicator of accessibility, but it is neither
  a necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring the accessibility of software.
- Content developers should describe any navigation mechanisms.
- Multimedia presentations may not always make text easier to understand.
- This document is intended to help authors of Web content who wish to claim conformance
  to 'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0'.
- The techniques in this document should help people author HTML that conforms to
  'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0'.
- Some changes to the definition of content per proposal from Eric.
- Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized.
- Section 1.2 has been rewritten. It is no longer essentially a summary of general
  design principles.
- Titles of 1.1 and 1.2 now include 'user agent' before 'design'.
- 'Implemented resolutions of 28 September teleconf as follows: modifications to Note:
  ''Note: Some software may not conform to this document but still be accessible to
  some users with disabilities. Conformance is expected to be a strong indicator of
  accessibility, but it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring
  the accessibility of software.'''
- Deleted old applicability provisions 1 and 4.
- Added new section on labeled sets of checkpoints per resolution of 28 September
  teleconference.
- Used the term 'subject' consistently in section on conformance.
- Elements that are deprecated in HTML 4.01 are followed by an asterisk (*)
- Elements that are obsolete in HTML 4.01 or don't exist in a W3C specification of
  HTML (2.0, 3.2, 4.01) do not appear in this table.
- This document contains a number of examples that illustrate accessible solutions
  in CSS but also deprecated examples that illustrate what content developers should
  not do.
- Ensure that information is not conveyed through color alone.
- Content developers are encouraged to use UL for unordered lists and OL for ordered
  lists.
- W3C does not guarantee the stability of any of the following references outside
  of its control.
- This document is a record of changes between each revision of the working draft
  for the page author techniques.
- This document is a Working Draft and may be updated or replaced.
- All markup languages defined are XML-based.
- Participants in any W3C activity must abide by the terms and spirit of the W3C Code
  of Conduct.
- The CEO may take disciplinary action, including suspending or removing for cause
  a participant in any group.
- This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by
  the normative WCAG 2.0 standard.
- The Advisory Board has no decision-making authority within W3C; its role is strictly
  advisory.
- The terms of elected Advisory Board participants are for two years.
- Each group must have a charter that is public
- The Chair and Staff Contact of a group should not be the same individual
- A charter does not need to include schedules for review of other group’s deliverables.
- Editorial changes or substantive changes to a charter that do not affect the scope
  of the group’s work or the way the group functions in any significant way are deemed
  minor changes.
- Documentation does not need to be public, the level of confidentiality is usually
  determined by the evaluation commissioner.
- Aggregated scores provide a numerical indicator to help communicate progress over
  time, but can be misleading.
- 'WCAG 2.0 is approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012.'
- Formal Objections receive formal consideration and a formal response.
- Council decisions must not attribute any position to any individual on the Council.
- Accessibility evaluation is also called 'assessment', 'audit', and 'testing'.
- ERT WG was originally chartered in 1998 and has been rechartered two times since
  then.
- This Process defines certain Recommendation Track publications as Patent Review
  Drafts.
- Checks cover just a few accessibility issues and are designed to be quick and easy,
  rather than definitive.
- These easy checks are not comprehensive or definitive.
- Data tables will not make sense when linearized — that's OK because screen readers
  have functionality to make data tables usable (when they are marked up correctly).
- BAD provides a clear example of how the basic structure check reveals accessibility
  barriers.
- Evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems
  that impact all users, including those without disabilities.
- Evaluating the accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities requires
  diverse kinds of expertise and perspectives.
- Comprehensive and effective evaluations require evaluators with an understanding
  of Web technologies, evaluation tools, barriers that people with disabilities experience,
  assistive technologies and approaches that people with disabilities use, and accessibility
  guidelines and techniques.
- The Working Group is scheduled to last for two years, from February 25th, 1999 to
  February 25th, 2001.
- Conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels
- Authors are encouraged to report any progress toward meeting success criteria from
  all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance
- This document is a draft and may be updated or replaced.
- Accessibility metrics should be used and designed responsibly.
- This document is a NOTE made available by the W3 Consortium for discussion only.
  This indicates no endorsement of its content, nor that the Consortium has, is, or
  will be allocating any resources to the issues addressed by the NOTE.
- This document was superseded in August 2015 by a newer version.
- The Part A success criteria apply to all aspects of the authoring tool user interface
  that are concerned with producing the included web content technologies.
- Some authors who have difficulty typing or operating the mouse benefit from simplified
  navigation and editing via content structure.
- The Advisory Board is not a board of directors and has no decision-making authority.
- A group may form task forces composed of group participants.
- The Submission process is not a means by which Members ask for ratification of documents
  as W3C Recommendations.
- Publication of a Note by W3C does not imply endorsement by W3C.
- This document is an update to a W3C Working Group Note to incorporate new guidelines,
  success criteria, and definitions added in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- Some were applicable without modification and some were applicable with edits and/or
  notes.
- Members must treat all Member-only documents as confidential within W3C.
- This document is purely an informative Note about non-web ICT. It is not a standard
  — so it does not describe how non-web ICT should conform to it.
- This document provides guidance on applying WCAG 2 to non-web information and communications
  technologies.
- The Chair and the Team contact of a group should not be the same individual.
- Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a
  user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not
  it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion.
- This success criterion is problematic to apply directly to non-web software because
  not all platforms provide text enlargement features that increase all displayed
  text to 200%.
- 'Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without
  requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width
  equivalent to 320 CSS pixels; Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent
  to 256 CSS pixels.'
- An example of appearance modification by the author is content that sets the visual
  style of a control, such as a color or border, to differ from the default style
  for the user agent or platform.
- 'A Coordination Group charter must include the following information: The group''s
  mission; The scope of the group''s work, including the names of coordinated groups
  and names of contacts in those groups; Any dependencies of this group on other entities;
  The level of confidentiality of the group''s proceedings and, in particular, whether
  the charter itself will be public. The charter should include rationale for any
  level of confidentiality other than public; IPR disclosure requirements (see W3C''s
  IPR policy); Meeting mechanisms and expected frequency; Communication mechanisms
  to be employed within the group, between the group and the rest of W3C, and with
  the general public; The expected level of involvement by the Team; An estimate of
  the expected time commitment from participants.'
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 1.4.13, replacing 'user agent' with 'user agent or other platform
  software', 'browser tooltips' with 'tooltips', and 'the HTML title attribute' with
  'user interface object attributes'.
- A best practice is to have the text of the label at the start of the name.
- Dragging movements for operation are less common in non-web documents. An example
  where a document author could add dragging functionality is an interactive prototype
  document created in a software design tool.
- For inline targets the line-height should be interpreted as perpendicular to the
  flow of text. For example, in a language displayed vertically, the line-height would
  be horizontal.
- The concepts behind the five Notes and in Understanding Accessibility Supported
  are applicable to web technologies. The same or similar factors are applicable for
  non-web technologies.
- This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, because the basic
  constructs on which WCAG 2 is built do not apply to these.
- Some changes are not listed here including spelling fixes, wording changes, some
  structural changes, and updates to the Appendixes.
- General changes for alignment with Patent Policy.
- Content must meet all success criteria to ensure accessibility.
- Authors can conform to WCAG 2.0 without making a claim.
- This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2 provisions (principles, guidelines,
  or success criteria) should or should not apply to non-web documents and software,
  but rather — if applied — how they would apply.
- This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2 or its supporting documents.
- WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 are designed to be backwards compatible.
- All content on the web page must meet this success criterion.
- This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component
  itself.
- This document remains available as a reference for old -- and possibly still deployed
  -- implementations, but is not recommended for future implementation.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 2.5.3.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 2.5.4.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 2.5.7.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 2.5.8.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 3.3.7
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 3.3.8
- The mission of the AG Working Group is to develop and maintain specifications for
  making web content accessible to people with disabilities.
- Techniques are informative—that means they are not required.
- This document is not intended to be used as a stand-alone document.
- WAI actively encourages broad participation from industry, disability organizations,
  accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web accessibility.
- This document is a Working Group Note and is part of a series of technical and educational
  documents.
- Essential components of web accessibility include content, user agents, assistive
  technology, and developers.
- This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2.0 provisions should or should
  not apply to non-web ICT, but rather how they would apply, if applied.
- This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2.0 itself, nor its supporting documents.
- ATAG is relevant today, as it is technology agnostic.
- WCAG2ICT is not a standard, so it is not possible to conform to WCAG2ICT.
- Supporting documents are informative or non-normative.
- Supplemental guidance is not required to meet WCAG.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships
  that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation
  format changes.
- It is important that it be possible to programmatically determine at least one sequence
  of the content that makes sense.
- Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that
  have low contrast.
- Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate.
- CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community.
- Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs.
- Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under
  them but are not required for conformance to WCAG.
- 'This document is part of Understanding WCAG 2.0: A guide to understanding and implementing
  WCAG 2.0'
- An alternative for time-based media provides a running description of all that is
  going on in the synchronized media content.
- Individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read captions and whose hearing
  is too poor to reliably hear dialogue can access the alternative for time-based
  media by using a refreshable braille display.
- Responsibility for providing captions falls to the content providers or the host
  caller, not the application.
- This document provides guidance on applying WCAG 2.0 to non-web information and
  communications technologies.
- 'Note: The concepts behind the five Notes and in Understanding Accessibility Supported
  are applicable to web technologies. The same or similar factors are applicable for
  non-web technologies.'
- Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded.
- The minimum contrast success criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including
  placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object
  or when an object has keyboard focus.
- This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, non-UI aspects of
  platforms, or the application of WCAG 2.0 for user-interface components as a category,
  because the basic constructs on which the WCAG 2.0 and / or its conformance are
  built do not apply to these.
- Text can be resized up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- Some of the above success criteria would apply to systems with closed functionality
  if they are partially closed or if they allow for the connection of some types of
  devices.
- While these guidelines are not suitable for closed functionality as written, they
  will inform and aid development of built-in accessible alternatives needed with
  closed functionality.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text
  and its background.
- 'This Web page is part of Understanding WCAG 2.0: A guide to understanding and implementing
  WCAG 2.0'
- This policy was produced by the W3C Patents and Standards Interest Group.
- This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique.
- The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not
  a keyboard equivalent to the application.
- Disclosure is required when certain conditions are met.
- Good faith obligation to disclose is ongoing.
- Disabling time limits is better than customizing the length of time limits, which
  is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs.
- Use clear headings that summarize the purpose of a page.
- Provide breadcrumbs to help users orient themselves in a site.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content
  of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.
- Make important tasks and features on the site stand out and easy to find.
- Divide media into chunks to allow users to easily find sections.
- For multilingual sites targeting Conformance Level A, the Working Group strongly
  encourages developers to follow Success Criterion 3.1.2 as well even though that
  is a Level AA Success Criterion.
- Summaries should use common words, short sentences, and be written in an easy to
  understand style and tense.
- Provide definitions or explanations for implied or ambiguous information.
- Consistent labeling will help users who rely on screen readers.
- Labels should use common words and easy to understand language, be visible and next
  to the relevant control, and be readable by assistive technologies.
- Clear labels help people with cognitive and learning disabilities and others to
  understand the controls available.
- Users with cognitive disabilities may require more time to read content or complete
  functions, and need clear instructions at the start of the process.
- Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available
  to turn off such changes.
- Avoid barriers such as navigating voice menus that involve remembering a specific
  number or term
- Allow users access to content, services or help, without using processes that rely
  on memory
- Content should be easy to find and use.
- Provide alternative content for complex information.
- Reminders must be set only at the user’s request and the user must be able to personalize
  the reminder method.
- Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so that the user
  does not get interrupted.
- It is essential not to add unwanted reminders, as this makes the user’s calendar
  too full.
- Too much information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too little.
- If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known,
  then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security
  or purpose of the content.
- Providing information about how to correct input errors allows users who have learning
  disabilities to fill in a form successfully.
- Providing safeguards to avoid serious consequences resulting from mistakes helps
  users with all disabilities who may be more likely to make mistakes.
- Provides safeguards to avoid consequences resulting from mistakes helps users with
  all disabilities who may be more likely to make mistakes.
- This document provides definitions and user stories related to cognitive and learning
  disabilities.

  technologies.
- The English version of this specification is the only normative version.
- Heading is used in its general sense and includes titles and other ways to add a
  heading to different types of content.
- This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this
  does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive
  technology).
- Content developers should strive for clear and accurate headings and link descriptions.
- Avoid causing the screen to flicker to prevent seizures in users with photosensitive
  epilepsy.
- Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user
  agents, including assistive technologies.
- If there is no important visual information, for example, an animated talking head
  that describes (through prerecorded speech) how to use the site, then an auditory
  description is not necessary.
- For movies, provide auditory descriptions that are synchronized with the original
  audio.
- Identifying changes in language are important for users using braille and speech
  synthesizers.
- Until user agents provide an overview of which key bindings are available, provide
  information on the key bindings.
- This document provides guidelines for designing Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  applications that lower barriers to Web accessibility for people with disabilities.
- Developers should provide a mechanism for freezing motion in applets.
- Dynamic content must be accessible or alternatives provided.
- Web content providers must able to offer alternative versions of their content if
  they wish to do so.

- Authors must provide alternative equivalent content to audio and video so that users
  with visual or auditory impairments may make use of the presentation.
- Authors must synchronize media objects correctly and describe relationships among
  objects.
- Authors should design documents that transform gracefully for players that do not
  support a particular feature.
- Leave the User Agent Support Page as is for now. If people find relevant resources,
  post to list for inclusion in references.
- Authors should use system-captions="on" with elements that specify captions and
  system-captions="off" for caption-related effects such as layout changes.
- In SMIL 1.0, values for system-overdub-or-caption only refer to user preferences
  for either subtitles or overdubs; there are no values for the test attribute that
  refer to neither or both.
- Authors might add a temporal navigation bar in parallel with the presentation.
- Players may offer other scaling strategies such as graphical zoom.
- This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by
  the normative WCAG 2.0 standard
- SVG allows manipulation of graphic shapes through defined elements.
- Stylesheets are used to define visual presentation of SVG elements.
- Authors are encouraged to provide a variety of ready-made stylesheets to cover different
  user needs.
- SVG provides means, such as the `switch` element, to control the rendering of images
  containing animation for static media.
- All markup languages written in XML automatically have some accessibility benefits.
- Evaluation findings are reported at the end of the process, documenting outcomes
  throughout the evaluation process.

- When pages are not designed properly, they can be unusable when the text size is
  changed.
- 'Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all'
- Web accessibility evaluation tools can help you quickly identify potential accessibility
  issues.
- Tools cannot check all accessibility aspects automatically. Human judgement is required.
- The primer does not provide a definitive specification of the XML Schema language.
- Evaluating the accessibility of Web content requires diverse expertise and perspectives.

- Report schema for Example.com
- Uses key and keyref elements to enforce constraints on XML elements
- Mechanisms for importing types from multiple namespaces are supported
- Event capture and bubbling processes allow for flexible event handling.
- Events can be cancelable, allowing listeners to prevent default actions.
- The DOM Level 2 Event Model allows for multiple modules of events.
- The Mouse event module is specifically designed for use with mouse input devices.
- The mutation event module is designed to allow notification of any changes to the
  structure of a document.
- Some authors may require access to alternative content in order to interact with
  the web content that they are editing.
- Uses the feature string 'HTMLEvents' for creating an Event instance.
- The load, unload, abort, error, select, change, submit, reset, focus, blur, resize,
  and scroll events are defined.
- SVG content can be interactive with user-initiated actions.
- Event attributes are not animatable.
- The contents of event attributes are always interpreted as ECMAScript, as if processed
  with the media type 'application/ecmascript'.
- This document is a stable reference material for animation functionality in XML.
- Automated and semi-automated checking is possible and encouraged for many types
  of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual checking is the minimum
  requirement to meet this success criterion.
- Automated and semi-automated repair is possible and encouraged for many types of
  web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual repair is the minimum
  requirement to meet this success criterion.
- The values must all be in the range 0 to 1.
- This attribute is ignored unless the `calcMode` is set to 'spline'.
- If there are any errors in the `keySplines` specification (bad values, too many
  or too few values), the animation will have no effect.
- If `calcMode` is set to 'discrete', 'linear' or 'spline', but the `keyTimes` attribute
  is not specified, the values in the `values` attribute are assumed to be equally
  spaced through the animation duration, according to the `calcMode`.
- At most one of repeatCount or repeatDur should be specified.
- Cumulative animation is not defined for 'to animation'.
- If a cell is empty, it indicates that the associated attribute is omitted in the
  syntax.
- Where the entry is a star ('*'), the value does not matter and can be any of the
  possibilities.
- The default begin value is an offset-value of 0.
- The special value 'indefinite' does not yield an instance time in the begin list.
- All content in the non-web document or software must meet the success criteria.
- This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component
  itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as
  links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content
  they are not covered by this criterion.
- This requirement applies to non-web software that interprets pointer actions.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 3.3.8, replacing 'the website' with 'a website, non-web document,
  or software'.
- The animate element cannot have child elements.
- The set element does not permanently set the value of the attribute.
- All values must represent sRGB color values.
- Legal value syntax for attribute values is defined by the host language.
- Values are corrected by clamping to the correct range.
- SVG is defined in terms of a document object model (DOM), rather than a particular
  file format or document type.
- It is outside of the scope of this document to define WCAG techniques for non-web
  ICT. These examples are simply illustrations of how WCAG 2 success criteria can
  be applied to this class of non-web software applications.
- The 2013 version of WCAG2ICT has been relied upon in regulations and legislation.
- XSL provides a comprehensive model and a vocabulary for writing stylesheets using
  XML syntax.
- XSL builds on the prior work on Cascading Style Sheets and the Document Style Semantics
  and Specification Language.
- All content must meet success criteria to avoid user interference.
- Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include tooltips created
  through use of user interface object attributes.
- The computed value must be the same for all possible corresponding properties.
- The treatment of the .conditionality component is for CSS2 compatibility.
- In most cases, a delimited text range is the maximal sequence of characters that
  would be formatted into a sequence of one or more line-areas.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in the guidelines.
- The expression language supports operations on a limited set of datatypes. These
  do not include <angle>, <time>, and <frequency>.
- In technologies where CSS is not used, the definition of 'CSS pixel' applies as
  described in Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software.
- 'If it is necessary to use the floor function for a property where a unit power
  of one is expected, then an expression such as: "floor(1.4in div 1.0in)*1.0in" must
  be used.'
- In XSL 1.1 this function may only be used as the value of the "writing-mode" and
  "reference-orientation" properties.
- Certain property values are described in terms of compound datatypes.
- Compound values of properties are inherited as a unit and not as individual components.
- If the User Agent can determine that the result is to be bound, then the page binding
  edge of any given page is the edge on which that page is intended to be bound.
- Commonly the page binding edge of a page with an odd folio-number is the start-edge
  of that page and the binding-edge of a page with an even folio-number is the end-edge
  of that page.
- Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
- User interface components include form elements and links as well as components
  generated by scripts.
- What is meant by 'component' or 'user interface component' here is also sometimes
  called 'user interface element'.
- The software presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows,
  frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another
  viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the software such
  as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports.
- For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be 'non-embedded'
  within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.
- A 'blank page' is a page generated under the blank-or-not-blank condition.
- This Working Group Note does not introduce any new privacy considerations.
- This Working Group Note does not introduce any new security considerations.
- It is outside of the scope of this document to define WCAG techniques for non-web
  ICT.
- The way to think about 'accessibility supported' and 'programmatically determined'
  may seem a little different for text applications, but the definitions are unchanged.
- This document is not a standard and doesn't describe how non-web ICT should conform
  to it.
- It is intended to help clarify how to use WCAG 2.0 to make non-web documents and
  software more accessible.
- If the value of the leader-pattern is 'use-content' the block-progression-dimension
  of the content-rectangle is determined in the same manner as for inline-areas; otherwise
  it is determined by the rule-thickness trait.
- If it is desired that the leader should stretch to fill all available space on a
  line, the maximum length of the leader should be specified to be at least as large
  as the column width.
- Uses fo:table-and-caption for formatting a table together with its caption.
- This applies directly as written, and as described in the Intent from Understanding
  Success Criterion 1.3.2
- Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech
  output if there is other audio playing at the same time.
- Uses WCAG 2.0 guidelines for accessibility.
- The use of the 'proportional-column-width()' function is only permitted when the
  fixed table layout is used.
- If the use of proportional column widths are desired on a table of an unknown explicit
  width, the inline-progression-dimension cannot be specified to be 'auto'. Instead,
  the width must be specified as a percentage.
- The result of using a percentage for the width may be unpredictable, especially
  when using the automatic table layout.
- It is an error if two or more table-cells overlap, for example because two or more
  table-cells attempt to span rows or columns into the same cell position within the
  table grid.
- Table-cells must each be entirely contained both horizontally and vertically in
  a single table-body, table-header or table-footer.
- 'Only the background properties: background-attachment, background-color, background-image,
  background-repeat, background-position-horizontal, and background-position-vertical
  from this set apply.'
- The fo:list-block flow object is used to format a list.
- The fo:list-item formatting object contains the label and the body of an item in
  a list.
- This applies directly as written and as described in Intent from Understanding Success
  Criterion 2.4.4.
- In software, a 'link' is any text string or image in the user interface outside
  a user interface control that behaves like a hypertext link.
- The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of
  each link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link.
- The formatting objects for indexing only provide facilities for generating the list
  of page numbers for individual index keys.
- Index cross references ('see' and 'see also' entries) are not associated with page
  numbers.
- Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple non-web documents occur in
  the same relative order each time they are repeated.
- Ensuring that navigation elements have consistent order when repeated within non-web
  documents directly addresses user needs identified in the Intent section.
- The fo:bookmark is a specialized form of the fo:basic-link with restrictions on
  the applicable properties and on its content model.
- The property 'starting-state' determines whether any sub-list of bookmarks is initially
  displayed or is hidden.
- Applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.0 glossary, replacing
  'Web content' with 'content'.
- This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties and
  is endorsed by W3C and its Members.
- Disclosure is required when a Member organization receives a disclosure request
  and has actual knowledge of a patent with Essential Claims.
- The fo:wrapper formatting object is used to specify inherited properties for a group
  of formatting objects.
- The fo:change-bar-begin is used to indicate the beginning of a 'change region' that
  is ended by the subsequent fo:change-bar-end.
- This document provides information on the development process and design options
  for making web sites and applications more usable and accessible for people with
  cognitive and learning disabilities.
- This property provides a pointer back to the original XML document(s) used to create
  this formatting object tree.
- W3C Accessibility guidelines strongly encourage the use of this property either
  on the fo:root or on the first formatting object generated from a given source document.
- XSL modifications to the CSS definition apply.
- Providing an easy to understand summary helps many people to quickly decide if the
  content is relevant to them and their current goal.
- Design should reduce mistakes and make error correction easy.
- Use clear labels and instructions for better usability.
- Provide feedback to users to indicate successful actions.
- The positions of these baselines can be adjusted by multiplying the design-space
  coordinate values by the baseline-table font-size.
- Memory barriers stop many users from using products or accessing help or content.
- Users can login, register, and reset credentials, without having more cognitive
  abilities then they need to use a simple web page.
- This pattern allows people with language and communication disabilities to login
  without being overwhelmed by blocks of text.
- Many people cannot use voice menu systems. This often stops people from completing
  critical tasks by themselves.
- Implementations must support at least one of the 'alignment-adjust' values defined
  in this Recommendation.
- Implementations must support at least one of the 'alignment-baseline' values defined
  in this Recommendation.
- Implementations must support at least one of the 'dominant-baseline' values defined
  in this Recommendation.
- Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex menu systems
  such as a voice menu with many different options.
- Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
- The documentation emphasizes the importance of including users with cognitive and
  learning disabilities in usability testing.
- Consent must be obtained from both the participant and their guardian if applicable.
- XSL modifications to the CSS definition include unique value types for certain properties.
- Page breaks only apply to descendants of the fo:flow formatting object, and not
  within absolutely positioned areas, or out-of-line areas.
- Column breaks in static-content apply except for those in the last (or only) column,
  which are ignored.
- Help users avoid mistakes — a good design makes errors less likely.
- Provide help and support — making it easy to get human help.
- Support adaptation and personalization — allow users to select preferred options.
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make web content
  more accessible to people with disabilities.
- Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address
  the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.
- Index class values enable control over how page numbers are merged into ranges.
- The index-class property is ignored on any formatting object for which an index-key
  property has not been specified.
- Not defined in all languages.
- For general software or web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere
  on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will
  provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and
  viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of
  75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS
  pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing
  the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower
  resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.
- A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
  red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance
  (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash
  consists of two opposing transitions.
- The working definition (as of 2022) in the field for 'pair of opposing transitions
  involving a saturated red' is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition
  is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or
  equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the
  CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram.
- The determination of which characters should be auto-rotated may vary across User
  Agents. The determination is based on a complex interaction between country, language,
  script, character properties, font, and character context.
- The list of input type purposes is based on the control purposes defined in the
  HTML 5.2 Autofill field section, but it is important to understand that a different
  technology may have some or all of the same concepts defined in its specification
  and only the concepts that are mapped to the meanings below are required.
- WCAG 2.2 builds on WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1
- Not all user needs are met by these guidelines
- All content on the web page must meet success criteria to avoid user interference.
- This success criterion covers sections within writing, not user interface components.
- This document outlines guidelines for making web content more accessible to people
  with disabilities.
- Shorthand properties take a list of subproperty values or the value inherit. One
  cannot mix 'inherit' with other subproperty values.
- 'Values for these properties have the following meanings: auto, always, avoid, left,
  right.'
- The list of input type purposes is based on the control purposes defined in the
  HTML specification's Autofill section
- Different technology may have some or all of the same concepts defined in its specification
- Guidelines include rationale and checkpoints.
- Checkpoints express requirements with informative text.

- The attributeType attribute is optional.
- If a target attribute is defined in an XML Namespace other than the default namespace
  for the target element, the author must specify the namespace of the target attribute
  using the associated namespace prefix.
- This attribute is ignored unless the `calcMode` is set to "spline".
- If `calcMode` is set to "discrete", "linear" or "spline", but the `keyTimes` attribute

  be evaluated.
- When times are added to the instance times lists, they may or may not be resolved.
- Accessibility of the documentation is covered by Guideline A.1.1 and Guideline A.1.2.

- The border or padding at the start-edge or end-edge of an inline-area may be specified
  as conditional.
- The padding of a block-area does not interact with any space-specifier.
- Line-areas do not have borders and padding.
- Using the nominal-requested-line-rectangle allows equal baseline-to-baseline spacing.
- Using the maximum-line-rectangle allows constant space between line-areas.
- Using the per-inline-height-rectangle and zero space-before and space-after allows
  CSS-style line box stacking.
- reference-orientation is a rotation and does not influence the correspondence mapping.
- If the start-indent or end-indent properties are not specified their inherited value
  is used in these formulae.

- The binding can be as simple as stapling or may be as complex as producing a book
  using an imposition scheme.
- This page provides a paraphrased summary of Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
  (ATAG) 2.0.
- Part A success criteria apply to all aspects of the authoring tool user interface
  that are concerned with producing included web content technologies.
- The authoring tool is responsible for ensuring that editing-views display web content
  in a way that is accessible to authors with disabilities.
- The success criterion requires authoring tools to handle cases of keyboard traps
  in rendered content.
- The fo:block formatting object is used for formatting paragraphs, titles, figure
  captions, table titles, etc.
- The fo:block-container flow object is used to generate a block-level reference-area.
- Some authors may benefit from no time limits for editing.
- Encourages authoring tools to preserve accessibility information during transformations.
- If the leader's minimum length is too long to place in the line-area, the leader
  will begin a new line.
- Automated and semi-automated checking is possible and encouraged for many types
  of web content accessibility problems.
- Automated and semi-automated repair is possible (and encouraged) for many types
  of web content accessibility problems.

  inaccessible authoring practices from examples in the documentation.
- 'Only the background properties: background-attachment, background-color, background-image,
  background-repeat, background-position-horizontal, and background-position-vertical

- 'The alignment of a formatting object with respect to its parent is determined by
  three things: the scaled-baseline-table of the parent and the alignment-baseline
  and alignment-point of the formatting object being aligned.'
- There are four properties that control alignment of formatting objects to the above
  set of baselines.
- XSL includes properties for formatting text and layout.
- The initial values for .precedence is 'force' and for .conditionality 'discard'.
- If it is desired that the letter space combine with other spaces that have less
  than forcing precedence, then the value of the 'letter-space' should be specified
  as a <space> with precedence less than force.
- Column breaks apply in descendants of fo:flow formatting objects.
- This property forms part of a selection rule to determine if the referenced page-master
  is eligible for selection at this point in the page-sequence.
- 'Values have the following meanings: blank: This master is eligible for selection
  if a page must be generated (e.g., to maintain proper page parity at the start or
  end of the page-sequence) and there are no areas from any of the fo:flow flows within
  the containing fo:page-sequence to be put on that page.'
- 'not-blank: This master is eligible for selection if this page contains areas from
  any of the fo:flow flows within the containing fo:page-sequence.'
- 'any: This master is always eligible for selection.'
- The 'writing-mode' property sets both the 'inline-progression-direction' and the
  'block-progression-direction'.
- The default orientation for glyphs is with the top of the glyph oriented toward
  the top of the reference area.
- The determination of which characters should be auto-rotated may vary across User
  Agents.
- 'Fallback: If it is not possible to present the characters in the correct order,
  then the User Agent should display either a ''missing character'' glyph or display
  some indication that the content cannot be correctly rendered.'
- The placement of any change bar is determined by the value of this property at the
  fo:change-bar-begin that starts the change bar; changes to this property after that
  do not affect the placement of the change bar begin generated.
- The thickness of any change bar is determined by the value of this property at the
  fo:change-bar-begin that starts the change bar; changes to this property after that
  do not affect the thickness of the change bar begin generated.
- 'Shorthand properties are only included in the highest XSL conformance level: ''complete''.'
- The 'background' property is a shorthand property for setting individual background
  properties.
- The CSS property shall be treated as a shorthand by XSL
- The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (ATAG WG) has closed.
- Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create
  high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products
  and services.
- Web accessibility is required by law in many situations.
- Resources provide guidance for individual project management and for managing accessibility
  throughout an organization.
- Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible.
- This content is mostly from 2013. The Curricula links to more recent resources.
- WAI provides an international forum for collaboration between industry, disability
  organizations, accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web
  accessibility.
- WAI develops strategies and standards for web accessibility.
- 'You can generally use WAI material for free, with two conditions: Clearly attribute
  the original source and include a link to it, as specified below. Do not modify
  the content (with a few exceptions, noted below).'
- Most WAI material is provided under the W3C Document License which grants permission
  to copy and distribute complete documents in any medium for any purpose, without
  fee or royalty.
- EOWG was closed in 2024.
- UAWG has closed. Some aspects of the formal group closing may be pending.
- The WAI Interest Group is a public forum with two mailing lists for sharing information
  and exchanging ideas about W3C’s digital accessibility work.
- Minor updates shown in GitHub diffs.
- Even when a web-based user interface has met the requirements of WCAG 2.0, many
  factors will determine the accessibility of any particular end-user's experience.
- Keyboard access is required without specific timings for individual keystrokes.
- Some authors may take longer to accomplish authoring tasks.
- Web-based authoring tools will already be required to meet this success criterion
  as part of a Success Criterion A.1.1.1.
- Includes guidelines for authoring tools to support authors with disabilities.
- Automated and semi-automated checking is possible (and encouraged) for many types
  of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual checking is the minimum
  requirement to meet this success criterion.
- All accessible content support features are turned on by default.
- Negotiated interruptions are recommended to inform authors about problems without
  forcing immediate action.
- Scheduled interruptions can alert authors at significant events without preventing
  actions like saving or publishing.
- D2L configured with Firefox addon - Toggle Animated GIFs above
- Some discussion about the definition of authoring tool and whether evaluation tools
  are Authoring Tools.
- The tool only must check for objects or elements that the tool has the ability to
  modify.
- Conformance claims are optional, but any claim that is made must record the user
  agent(s).
- Web-based authoring tools will already be required to meet this success criterion
  as part of Success Criterion A.1.1.1.
- Some authors may need to set their own display settings.
- This documentation covers features related to accessibility.
- The intent of the guidelines is to support accessible web content production.
- Accessibility information should be preserved during transformations.
- Guidelines for creating accessible web content
- The success criterion does not specify how multiple instances of the same problem
  should be handled, because this will usually depend on the nature of the problem
  and the degree of automation in the checking and repair features of the authoring
  tool.
- Automated and semi-automated repair is possible (and encouraged) for many types
  of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual repair is the minimum
  requirement to meet this success criterion.
- Negotiated and scheduled interruptions are preferred over immediate interruptions.
- The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 provide guidance to developers on
  how to design accessible authoring tools.
- Groups resolve issues through dialog.
- Individuals who disagree strongly with a decision should register with the Chair
  any Formal Objections.
- Working Groups are intended to be small (typically fewer than 15 people)
- Interest Groups have no limit on the number of participants
- W3C follows specific steps when advancing a technical report to Recommendation.
- Public AUWG mailing list available for contributions.
