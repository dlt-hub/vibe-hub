  - OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Client must send browser to oauth2/authorize
    endpoint with client_id, state (randomized), redirect_uri (must match developer
    portal config), and response_type=code. After user authorizes, exchange the returned
    code for access token via POST to oauth2/access_token with code, client_id, and
    client_secret (code valid for 5 minutes only). Access token retrieved from vault
    as authorization-secret.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with client credentials. Exchange authorization
    code for access token by POSTing to https://na.lightify-api.com/oauth2/access_token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded containing client_id, client_secret,
    code, grant_type set to authorization_code, and redirect_uri. The code is valid
    for 5 minutes and redirect_uri must match the authorize call URI. Refresh tokens
    using the same endpoint with grant_type set to refresh_token and the refresh_token
    parameter; refreshing invalidates current tokens and returns new access and refresh
    tokens for subsequent API calls.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow using form-encoded POST request. Send client_id, client_secret,
    refresh_token, and grant_type=refresh_token as URL-encoded form data to https://na.lightify-api.com/oauth2/access_token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded header to obtain new access
    tokens.
