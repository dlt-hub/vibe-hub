auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/v1/reference/introduction/:
  - 'The API requires authentication for the vast majority of endpoints. Two schemes
    are supported: Basic HTTP authentication (primary method) and OAuth 2.0. For Basic
    HTTP auth, encode username and password as base64 and include in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)". Refer to the Authentication
    reference page for OAuth 2.0 details and additional options.'
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/docs/single_sign_on/configuration/:
  - Single sign-on (JWT) authentication is configured with a shared secret (minimum
    32 characters) placed in the Shared SSO secret field, along with remote login
    and logout URLs, and a remote system name identifier. The shared secret is used
    to validate JWT tokens for SSO integration with external identity providers.
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/v1/event/events/:
  - The bulk incoming webhook endpoint uses a token-based authentication mechanism.
    The authentication token is passed as a URL path parameter named "token" in the
    endpoint URL (e.g., /api/v1/bulk/webhook/:token/incoming.json). The token value
    is included directly in the request path and must be provided to authorize access
    to the webhook endpoint.
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/:
  - 'Most API endpoints require authentication using either Basic HTTP authentication
    or OAuth 2.0. Basic authentication encodes username and password as base64 and
    sends them in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)".
    Alternatively, OAuth 2.0 authentication is available for more flexible authentication
    flows.'
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/v1/users/cases/:
  - Retrieve user conversations requires API scope-based authentication. Allowed roles
    are Collaborators, Agents, Admins, and Owners, with the required scope being conversations.
    The endpoint path includes a user ID parameter (:id) that must be specified in
    the request URL.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/v1/reference/pagination/:
  - Cursor-based pagination uses `before_id` and `after_id` query parameters to navigate
    collections ordered by ID. Use `before_id` with the first item's ID on current
    page to get previous results, and `after_id` with the last item's ID to get next
    results. Response includes `first_url`, `previous_url`, `next_url`, and `last_url`
    fields for navigation; `total_count` indicates collection size.
  - Pagination uses either cursor-based or date-based methods. Cursor-based uses after_id
    and count query parameters. Date-based uses since and until query parameters with
    ISO 8601 timestamps to filter resources by their timestamp field; resources are
    ordered ascending or descending by date and support only one pagination style
    per endpoint.
- information_source; https://developer.kayako.com/api/v1/cases/timetracking/:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes offset
    (current position), limit (items per page, default 10), total_count (71 total
    items), and next_url and last_url fields for navigation. Use the next_url to fetch
    the next page until reaching the end.
