auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.devicewise.com/Content/Products/IoT_Portal_API_Reference_Guide/HTTP_Interface/REST-API.htm
  : - Authentication is performed via a sessionId parameter passed in the form data
      of POST requests. The sessionId must be included in every request as a form-encoded
      parameter named sessionId to authenticate the client and authorize access to
      the API endpoints.
    - Authentication requires a POST request to the /rest/auth endpoint with form-encoded
      credentials. For user authentication, send username and password parameters.
      For thing authentication, send thingKey, appToken, and appId parameters. The
      response returns a sessionId string that must be included as a form parameter
      (sessionId=<sessionId>) in subsequent API requests.
    - 'Authentication uses a session-based approach where a sessionId must be provided
      with every request. The sessionId is passed as a query parameter for GET requests
      or as form data for POST requests.


      Key details: sessionId parameter is required in all API calls; it is sent as
      a URL query parameter (e.g., ?sessionId=<sessionId>) for GET requests and as
      form-encoded data (sessionId=<sessionId>) for POST requests; example sessionId
      format shown is 50m3535510n1dg035h3r3.'
    - Session-based authentication is required. Include the sessionId parameter in
      either the request body (form data) for POST requests or as a query parameter
      for GET requests. The sessionId value must be obtained prior to making API calls
      and is passed as sessionId=<sessionId>.

  : - 'Two-step MFA activation uses parameters sent in request bodies: the first step
      requires loginFqdn and twoStep=true to get an mfaRef and QR code, then the second
      step requires mfaRef and mfaToken (from an authenticator app) to complete activation.
      The loginFqdn parameter specifies the Open Server endpoint FQDN for the authentication
      flow.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.devicewise.com/Content/Products/IoT_Portal_API_Reference_Guide/APIs/User/user.list.htm:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. Offset defaults to 0 and specifies
    the starting position; limit defaults to 2000 with a maximum of 2000. The response
    includes a count field indicating the number of results returned. When support
    parameter is true, results are not paginated.
- ? information_source; https://docs.devicewise.com/Content/Products/IoT_Portal_API_Reference_Guide/APIs/User/user.alert.ack.list.htm
  : - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. offset (integer, optional, defaults
      to 0) specifies the starting position. limit (integer, optional, defaults to
      2000, maximum 2000) specifies the number of results per request. Iterate by
      incrementing offset by the limit value until fewer results than limit are returned.
