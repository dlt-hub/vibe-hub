auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.powerly.app/docs/:
  - API authentication uses an API key that must be sent in the API-KEY header. The
    API key format is a pipe-separated string like "140|sVh0Lr2iANbwsQBXo8zT8wux0QN8LQVLDmOzvhHp1dab78b8".
    Include this header with every request to authenticate.
  - 'API authentication uses an API-KEY header that must be included in all requests.
    The API-KEY value is a pipe-delimited token (format: numeric_id|token_string)
    sent in the "API-KEY" header along with standard Content-Type and Accept headers
    set to application/json.'
  - API key authentication is required via the API-KEY header. Send your API key in
    the request header with the exact name "API-KEY" and value format "id|token" (e.g.,
    "140|sVh0Lr2iANbwsQBXo8zT8wux0QN8LQVLDmOzvhHp1dab78b8").

    in a data array field, though the documentation does not show next page indicators,
    continuation tokens, or explicit instructions for navigating to subsequent pages.
