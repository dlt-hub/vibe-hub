notes:
- This release brings bug fixes, better support for extension arrays including returning
  a pandas.IntervalArray from groupby_bins, and performance improvements.
- This release brings the ability to specify fill_value and write_empty_chunks for
  Zarr V3 stores, and a few bug fixes.
- Xarray now makes a best attempt not to coerce pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray
  to a numpy array by supporting 1D ExtensionArray objects internally where possible.
- This release brings a major upgrade to xarray.concat(), many bug fixes, and a bump
  in supported dependency versions.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Minimum supported versions for the following packages have changed: dask >=2.9,
  distributed>=2.9.'
- 'This release brings many improvements to xarray’s documentation: our examples are
  now binderized notebooks and we have new example notebooks from our SciPy 2019 sprint.'
- This is a major release that includes bug fixes, new features and a few backwards
  incompatible changes.
- Dropped support for Python 2.6
- This release brings a number of small improvements and fixes, especially related
  to writing DataTree objects and netCDF files to disk.
- Uses fastpath when grouping both montonically increasing and decreasing variable
  in GroupBy
- This release brings new hypothesis strategies for testing, significantly faster
  rolling aggregations as well as ffill and bfill with numbag, a new Dataset.eval()
  method, and improvements to reading and writing Zarr arrays (including a new 'a-'
  mode).
- Allow reading netcdf files where the ‘units’ attribute is a number.
- Allow decoding of 0 sized datetimes.
- Make sure DataArray.name is always a string when used as label for plotting.
- PyNIO support is now untested. The minimum versions of some dependencies were changed.
- This release brings a few important performance improvements, a wide range of usability
  upgrades, lots of bug fixes, and some new features.
- Fix bug where reference times without padded years would lose their units when being
  passed by encode_cf_datetime.
- Fix bug where reading a scalar value from a NetCDF file opened with the h5netcdf
  backend would raise a ValueError when decode_cf=True.
- 'This release brings many improvements to xarray’s documentation: our examples are
  now binderized notebooks.'
- This is the last xarray release that will support Python 2.7.
- Future releases will be Python 3 only, but older versions of xarray will always
  be available for Python 2.7 users.
- By default xarray now encodes numpy.timedelta64 values by converting to numpy.int64
  values and storing "dtype" and "units" attributes consistent with the dtype of the
  in-memory numpy.timedelta64 values.
- Allows setting a fill_value for Zarr format 3 arrays.
- Support for reading Zarr V3 datasets into a DataTree.
- This release brings official support for `xarray.DataTree`, and compatibility with
  zarr-python v3!
- This release brings various performance optimizations and compatibility with the
  upcoming numpy 2.0 release.
- This is our 10th year anniversary release!
- This release brings a large number of bugfixes and documentation improvements, as
  well as an external interface for setting custom indexes.
- This is the last xarray release that will support Python 2.7. Future releases will
  be Python 3 only.
