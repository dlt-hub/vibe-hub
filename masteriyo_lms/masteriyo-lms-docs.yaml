notes:
- If deactivating and reactivating do not solve your problem, please look at the third
  topic for tips on troubleshooting the issue and report it to the support team.
- Access to the Account page is restricted to certain user roles.
- The student should already be registered to the site so that any paid course can
  be assigned to that student.
- Enable WP_DEBUG mode
- Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
- You can edit the courses with the WordPress Editor to get access of all the features
  that might have been restricted in the Block editor.
- This feature is available only in the Masteriyo LMS Pro.
- Students can review the course by clicking on the Rate this course button.
- Once you have selected the editor and saved the changes, we suggest you reload the
  page to reflect the changes.
- Ensure your JavaScript code is loaded correctly and not blocked by other scripts.
- Check the browser console for any errors.
- Verify that the Masteriyo LMS plugin is up to date.
- Ensure field names are unique to avoid conflicts.
- 'Dynamic Placeholders: Preserve tags like `{user_name}`, `{course_title}`, or `{site_url}`.'
- If email strings don't appear in the String Translation section, try triggering
  different Masteriyo email notifications.
- Ensure WPML's string translation module is configured correctly.
- Check that your WordPress site's language settings match your WPML configuration.
- Make sure to exclude Masteriyo default pages from the cache, disable caching for
  logged-in users, and turn off the cache for the REST API.
- If the login form is not showing on the account page, then it means that you have
  not added the respective shortcode on that page.
- Now, this should display the login form on the account page.
- However, you need to adjust one more setting to make sure the login form works properly.
- By default, Masteriyo marks specific billing fields as required based on your Settings
  > Payments > Checkout Fields.
- After installing the Check & Log Email plugin, submit a form from which the emails
  are not being delivered.
- If the email log with green tick on the sent status were not delivered to the respective
  email address, the issue is with the email server.
- Always use caution while testing for conflicts on a live website. A backup is advised
  before you start.
- Use a professional domain-based email address when possible
- Check mail logs regularly to identify potential delivery issues
- It's the most secure way of providing access to your site, where you can set roles,
  times, etc.
- SMTP Authentication should always be checked 'Yes' as popular email providers require
  authentication.
- Server Sync Interval Duration default is 5 minutes.
- Idle Time Threshold default is 30 minutes.
- For troubleshooting the issues with the email delivery, we will need a third-party
  plugin called Check & Log Email.
- If the email log that have green tick on the sent status were not delivered to the
  respective email address, the issue is with the email server you are using. In this
  case, you will need to contact the hosting provider and ask them about the issue
  with the email delivery.
- If the email log has a red cross status, the issue is with the site's email sending
  system. In this case, using a SMTP plugin like Easy SMTP, WP SMTP, etc will fix
  the issue.
- Masteriyoâ€™s Course Builder provides a convenient way to export or import individual
  quizzes in .json format.
- Steps to find out the PHP and WordPress versions of your site.
- Masteriyo is a React-based advanced LMS plugin.
