auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.honeycomb.io/configure/teams/manage-api-keys/:
  - Management API Keys are used to authorize requests to the Key Management API at
    the team level. You must manually create a Management API Key in the Honeycomb
    UI and assign it scopes that determine what actions it can perform. All programmatic
    requests to Honeycomb require an API Key; most APIs operate at the Environment
    level and require a Configuration Key for resource management. Refer to the Key
    Management API documentation for specific details on how to send the API Key in
    requests.
  - The Honeycomb API uses API Keys for authentication. You need both a Key Secret
    and a Key ID to use the Management API. The Key Secret must be stored securely
    and never committed to version control. Refer to the Key Management API documentation
    for details on how to send these credentials with requests.
- information_source; https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/:
  - Honeycomb API uses API Keys for authentication. API Keys have various scopes and
    permissions and belong to a specific Team or Environment. Any valid Honeycomb
    ingest or configuration API Key will work with the API endpoints. The API Keys
    are used to validate authentication and determine authorizations and the Team
    and Environment that a key belongs to.
  - Honeycomb API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" for all requests to authenticate.
- information_source; https://docs.honeycomb.io/configure/environments/manage-api-keys/:
  - 'API Keys are required for authentication with Honeycomb. There are two types:
    Ingest API Keys for sending data and Configuration API Keys for managing settings.
    API Keys should be copied immediately upon creation and stored securely, as they
    cannot be retrieved again. Team Owners must create the keys, and Configuration
    keys can have visibility restricted to Team Owners only or shared with all Team
    members. The API Key is a concatenation of a key ID and secret that must be sent
    with requests, though the specific header or parameter name for sending the key
    is not detailed in this excerpt.'

  - Cursor-based pagination using page[after] query parameter (optional, cursor value
    from response) and page[size] query parameter (optional, default or specified
    page size). Response includes data array with paginated API key objects.
