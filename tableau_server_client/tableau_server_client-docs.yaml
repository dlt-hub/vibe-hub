  - ConnectionCredentials class supports embedding passwords in workbook and data
    source publish requests. Use the `ConnectionCredentials(name, password, embed=True,
    oauth=False)` constructor where `name` is the username, `password` is the connection
    password, `embed` is a boolean to embed the password in the published resource,
    and `oauth` is a boolean to specify OAuth authentication for the connection.
  - Personal access token authentication requires passing a token name and token value
    to the PersonalAccessTokenAuth class, along with a site_id parameter for Tableau
    Cloud. The authentication token is managed by calling auth.sign_in with a TableauAuth
    object, which keeps you signed in for 240 minutes until auth.sign_out is called.
  - The TSC library uses the TableauAuth class for authentication. Create an instance
    with username, password, and optional site_id (corresponding to contentUrl in
    the REST API), then pass it to the Auth.sign_in method. The site_id is the URL
    segment following /site/ in the Tableau Server URL, or use an empty string for
    the default site.
  - 'The Tableau Server Client supports two authentication methods: TableauAuth using
    username and password, or PersonalAccessTokenAuth using a personal access token
    name and token value. Both require a site_id parameter (contentUrl), which can
    be an empty string for the default site on Tableau Server but must be provided
    for Tableau Cloud. Authentication is performed by instantiating the appropriate
    auth class and calling server.auth.sign_in() with the auth object.'
  - Username and password authentication via the TableauAuth object. Create a TableauAuth
    instance with username and password strings, then pass it to server.auth.sign_in()
    to authenticate. The sign_in method handles token acquisition; sign_out() invalidates
    the token. The switch_site() method allows switching between sites without reauthentication
    on the same server.
