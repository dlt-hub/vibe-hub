  - "All REST calls need authorization using an API token obtained from the studio\
    \ under Settings \u2192 Connect \u2192 REST API. The token should be sent with\
    \ each request as specified in the REST API documentation."
- information_source; https://developer.dialox.ai/dev/rest/:
  - "API Token authentication is required and can be passed as a Bearer token in the\
    \ Authorization header or as an api_key query parameter. The token is obtained\
    \ from the studio under Channels \u2192 REST API or Administration \u2192 Organisation\
    \ \u2192 (select environment) \u2192 \"API\" side panel.\n\nPass the token as\
    \ Authorization: Bearer {token} in the request header, or alternatively as a query\
    \ parameter api_key={token} in the URL, though the latter should be avoided due\
    \ to security concerns with request logging exposure."
  - "All REST API calls require authorization using an API token. The token can be\
    \ obtained from the studio under Channels \u2192 REST API for a single bot, or\
    \ from Administration \u2192 Organisation \u2192 (select environment) \u2192 \"\
    API\" side panel for an environment-level token. The token must be sent with each\
    \ REST request, though the specific header or parameter name for sending the token\
    \ is not detailed in this excerpt."

  - "All REST calls require an API token passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization\
    \ header. The API token can be obtained from the studio under Channels \u2192\
    \ REST API (for a single bot) or Administration \u2192 Organisation \u2192 API\
    \ (for environment-level access). Send the token in the request header as Authorization:\
    \ Bearer <token>."
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication passed as the `Authorization` header
    with the format `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Alternatively, the API key can
    be passed as a query parameter named `api_key`, though this is discouraged due
    to security risks of exposing the key in request logs.'
