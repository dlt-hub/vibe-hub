auth_info:
- information_source; https://ads-api.reddit.com/docs/v2/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required via the Authorization header. The token
    must have sufficient scopes; requests without a valid bearer token return 401,
    and requests with insufficient scopes return 403.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. The API expects a valid bearer token
    in the Authorization header. A 401 response indicates no bearer token or an invalid
    token was provided, and a 403 response indicates insufficient authentication scopes.
  - Conversion access tokens are required for authenticating requests to the Reddit
    conversion events API. Generate a token via the dashboard, then include it in
    requests to the endpoint https://ads-api.reddit.com/api/v2.0/conversions/events/{{pixel_id}}.
    The token value must be kept secure as it cannot be retrieved after generation
    and a new token must be created if lost. The documentation does not specify the
    exact header name or parameter name where the token should be sent in requests.
  - OAuth2 with authorization code flow is used for authentication. The API requires
    a bearer token in the Authorization header. The scope `adsread` is required to
    access account information. A 401 response indicates a missing or invalid bearer
    token, and a 403 response indicates insufficient authentication scopes.
  - Reddit API Key authentication is required with the "adsread" scope. Send the API
    key as a bearer token in the Authorization header. A 401 response indicates a
    missing or invalid bearer token, and a 403 response indicates insufficient authentication
    scopes.
