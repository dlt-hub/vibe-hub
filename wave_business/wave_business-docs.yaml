auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.wave.com/b2b/payout/index.html:
  - API keys are used for authentication, bound to a single business wallet. Each
    wallet requires its own API key. API keys can perform any API request and should
    be treated as sensitive credentials. The documentation does not specify the exact
    header name or parameter name for submitting the API key.
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token. Send credentials as `Authorization: Bearer
    wave_sn_prod_YhUNb9d...i4bA6` where the token value follows the pattern `wave_sn_prod_`
    followed by the actual token string.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" where the token follows the format "wave_sn_prod_"
    followed by alphanumeric characters. Additionally, an Idempotency-Key header is
    required for POST requests.'
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header ''Authorization: Bearer wave_sn_prod_YhUNb9d...i4bA6'' where
    the token value follows the Bearer scheme. Additionally, include an ''idempotency-key''
    header with a UUID value to ensure request idempotency.'
  - 'The Wave API requires Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization
    header. Include the header Authorization: Bearer wave_sn_prod_YhUNb9d...i4bA6
    (or your actual token) with requests. Additionally, include an idempotency-key
    header with a unique UUID value to ensure idempotent request handling.'
