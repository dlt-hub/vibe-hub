- Middleware is code that exists between the request and response.
- Stratigility provides a barebones middleware for handling 404 conditions.
- ErrorHandler middleware needs a prototype response instance.
- Middleware piped to a MiddlewarePipe must implement the PSR-15 middleware interface.
- We now support only PHP versions 7.1 and above. PHP 5.6 and 7.0 support has been
  dropped.
