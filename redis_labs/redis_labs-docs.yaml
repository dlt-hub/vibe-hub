auth_info:
- information_source; https://storage.googleapis.com/rlecrestapi/rest-html/http_rest_api.html:
  - Request body for authorization should include username and password fields. The
    API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. After a successful POST request
    to /v1/users/authorize with valid credentials, a JWT token is returned and must
    be used for subsequent API requests. Include the JWT token in the Authorization
    header for authenticated endpoints. Required permission to view user info is view_all_users_info.
  - 'Required permissions to access this endpoint: view_all_roles_info. This indicates
    role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced, where callers must have the view_all_roles_info
    permission granted to their account or API credentials to successfully call the
    POST /v1/redis_acls endpoint.'
  - Required permissions view_bdb_stats must be granted to the authenticated user
    to access this endpoint. The documentation does not specify the authentication
    mechanism (headers, tokens, or credential format) for obtaining or validating
    these permissions.
  - Reset or add passwords for internal users by providing username, old_password,
    and new_password in the JSON request body. Authentication is performed using these
    credentials within the request payload itself.
  - Set or update cluster LDAP configuration requires config_ldap permission. LDAP
    credentials are sent in the request body as bind_dn and bind_pass fields.
