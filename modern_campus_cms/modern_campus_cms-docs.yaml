  - 'Authentication uses a two-step process: first, POST credentials (username and
    password) to the login endpoint to obtain a gadget_token, then include that token
    in the X-Auth-Token header for subsequent API requests.


    Key details: POST to https://a.cms.omniupdate.com/authentication/login with username
    and password in the request body; the response JSON contains a gadget_token field;
    use this token in the X-Auth-Token header for authenticated requests like https://a.cms.omniupdate.com/users/groups?user=[username].'
  - 'To use the Modern Campus CMS APIs, you must first login to obtain a gadget_token,
    which is then appended as the custom header X-Auth-Token to all subsequent API
    calls. If using an Authentication method to login, WebDAV must be enabled on the
    user account (available only for level 9 and 10 users), and the user must have
    a local CMS password. Login is performed via POST to https://a.cms.omniupdate.com/authentication/login
    with URLEncoded body parameters: skin (SKINNAME from browser URL), account (from
    browser URL or Setup > Account > General Settings), username, and password.'
- information_source; https://support.moderncampus.com/cms/technical-reference/custom-gadgets.html:
  - Calls to the Modern Campus CMS API must be authenticated using a gadget token
    obtained via gadgetlib.js. The token should be passed as a query string parameter
    named authorization_token in both GET and POST requests. The token is retrieved
    using gadget.get('token') after gadget.ready() resolves, and it represents the
    user's authenticated session, limiting access to only the functionality the user
    has permission to access.
