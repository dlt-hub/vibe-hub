notes:
- A printer firmware update fixes problems and adds new features. For this reason,
  it is recommended to keep the firmware up to date.
- The CloudPRNT protocol uses the MAC address of the printer's Ethernet LAN port,
  even when connected over a wireless LAN.
- All CloudPRNT-compatible printers support the CloudPRNT communication protocol Version
  HTTP.
- To achieve a quicker start of printing, it is recommended to use Full MQTT / Pass
  URL.
- Some paths are hardcoded to simplify the source code.
- Uses Full MQTT / Pass URL for lower-latency printing
- The printer sends a client-status message instead of a POST request for status notifications
- The server setting information file is response body (JSON) to a GET request from
  a CloudPRNT Version MQTT-compatible printer.
- The CloudPRNT protocol uses the MAC address of the printer's Ethernet LAN port.
- This value uses Full MQTT / Pass URL.
- Uses Full MQTT / Pass URL for lower-latency communications
- The database must be found in <document_root>/php_queue/simplequeue.sqlite.
- The API related to generation of print data were moved to the StarMicronics.StarDocumentMarkup-Utility
  package beginning from StarMicronics.CloudPRNT-Utility V2.0.0.
- CPUtil is a useful back-end tool to help with implementing CloudPRNT servers that
  are not .NET framework or .NET Core-based.
- Once built, CPUtil can be integrated with projects on the server using a language
  or environment that invokes external processes.
- CPUtil is designed to assist with CloudPRNT-specific requirements for server development.
- When StarMicronics.CloudPRNT-Utility V2.0.0 or later is installed, StarMicronics.StarDocumentMarkupUtility
  is also installed at the same time.
- When using HTTPS communication, it sometimes takes a long time for the printer to
  start printing.
- Use TLS 1.2 for HTTPS communication with the printer and avoid using resource-intensive
  cipher suites.
- Use the 'Full MQTT' version of the MQTT protocol to prevent session disconnections.
