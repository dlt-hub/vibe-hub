notes:
- Currently, live streams with AI-generated closed captions and/or speech translations
  have a maximum 'continuous' duration of 25 hours.
- An AI event has a maximum duration of 24 consecutive hours.
- The maximum duration of a cloud recording is also 24 hours.
- Enabling real-time correction will result in an increased latency of about 30 seconds.
- Fast and stable connection to Clevercast servers is recommended.
- Users need a fast and stable internet connection to the Clevercast streaming servers
  located in the Netherlands.
- HTTP uploads are limited to files up to 200 GB.
- Files uploaded to hotfolders may only contain alphanumeric characters, dots (.),
  hyphens (-) and underscores (_).
- Maximum duration of a recording is 24 hours.
- Recordings are deleted automatically after 30 days.
- This manual applies to the latest version of Clevercast Webinar, which is used by
  all accounts created after 21 September 2023.
- Clevercast Webinar is not made for accreditation purposes which require proof that
  a participant has watched the stream.
- Audience polls are not available for public webinars.
- Results of audience polls remain visible until a new question is published.
- A poll question that has been unpublished is set to finalized and cannot be published
  again, except when no answer was given.
- An intro and outro of at least two minutes long is required to ensure that all viewers
  will see the actual video in full under all circumstances.
- Clevercast player will buffer a number of seconds of the live stream, before starting
  to play the video.
- You can simulcast to social media channels such as YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
- AI-generated closed captions can be included as subtitles in the simulcasted stream.
- Make sure to read the requirements and best practices for remote simultaneous interpretation
  before you start using Clevercast Translate@Home.
- A bilingual interpreter room allows an interpreter to translate the floor audio
  into two languages in turn.
- In a bilingual interpreter room, the handover procedure is only possible while both
  interpreters have selected the same language (until the handover is completed).
- We strongly recommend using Firefox.
- WiFi (and other forms of wireless data transfer) are very strongly discouraged and
  can lead to very poor audio quality.
- Interpreters should have a bandwidth of at least 5 Mbps up and 5 Mbps down.
- Most browsers do not allow content to play automatically with sound. When you enable
  autoplay, it is advised to also enable muted.
- Clevercast does cloud transcoding for adaptive streaming.
- It’s better to have a stable stream than to push for a higher video quality that
  results in dropped frames.
- A multilingual RTMP broadcast is only possible from Europe.
- Our player requires the domains '*.clevercast.com' and '*.rambla.be' to be accessible.
- Exceptionally, 3rd party platforms may require the query-string arguments in the
  direct link to be separated by the char entity '&amp;' (instead of '&')
- Requires an AI Multilingual plan with at least one simulcast target.
- Broadcast at least a couple of minutes in advance.
- Wait a couple of minutes after your event has ended before pressing the End event
  button.

- Make sure to read the requirements and best practices before you start using the
  subtitling room.
- The OpenH264 video codec should be enabled in the Firefox plug-ins.
- Make sure to follow our broadcast guidelines
- Make sure you’ve copied the broadcast URL and stream name correctly to your encoder
  (no leading or trailing spaces)
- When using stereo tracks, ensure that each stereo track contains 2 languages panned
  L+R.
