notes:
- If you’re using Chrome, try switching to Edge or Firefox.
- Before switching, it might also help to clear your browser’s cache and cookies or
  open a new incognito/private browsing session.
- Switching to Microsoft Edge immediately resolved the CSRF token error.
- Custom ChatGPT assistant designed for VMware ESXi command-line interface (esxcli)
  queries.
- Virtual machines cannot be migrated while they are using a shared SCSI bus, flagged
  for multi-writer, enabled for fault tolerance, or configured for shared VMDK disk
  sharing.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires GitHub account with appropriate permissions.
- Ensure vCenter Adapter is properly configured in Aria Operations.
- Activate pre-defined metrics and alerts for monitoring.
- Monitor ESXi host temperatures for effective infrastructure management.
- The API provides comments related to posts on Baking Clouds Ltd.
- Ensure the vCenter Adapter is properly configured in Aria Operations.
- Regularly review the collected data to ensure the health and optimal performance
  of your ESXi hosts.
- It is crucial to remediate these vulnerabilities promptly to mitigate any potential
  risks to your VMware environment.
- Application submissions for the vExpert program will close on June 30th.
- The results will be announced via email on or before July 21st.
- The primary cause of the “No Update Instance Running” issue is often related to
  disk space problems.
- Ensure you are removing the correct files and exercise caution during this process.
- The NFS mount and the share containing the backups directory must have `750` permission
  and `vcloud.vcloud` ownership.
- Once you have completed the cloud challenge, you are eligible to take the certification
  exam at no cost
- Access to the entire digital OCI training catalogue, which includes courses for
  all levels and multiple roles and is available at all times and in 13 languages.
- Hands-on labs are available through the Oracle Cloud free tier, allowing for practise
  in a live environment.
