  - 'Authentication requires a bearer token sent in the Authorization header. For
    Splunk versions prior to 7.3.0, use the format "Authorization: Splunk $token"
    where the token is obtained from a session response. For Splunk 7.3.0 and later,
    use "Authorization: Bearer <token>" with an authentication token created for the
    service account user. Tokens remain valid for one hour by default.'
  - Authentication to the TrackMe API requires Splunk user credentials with read and
    write permissions to TrackMe namespace objects. For Splunk versions prior to 7.3.0,
    use either HTTP basic auth (username:password in curl -u flag) or obtain a session
    token via POST to /services/auth/login with username and password parameters,
    then use the returned sessionKey in subsequent requests. The built-in trackme_admin
    role provides the necessary permissions.

  - 'Splunk API authentication uses tokens sent in the Authorization header. For Splunk
    versions prior to 7.3.0, use the format "Authorization: Splunk $token" where the
    token is a session-based credential valid for 1 hour by default. For Splunk 7.3.0
    and later, use the format "Authorization: Bearer <token>" with a proper authentication
    token created as a service account. Both approaches require passing the token
    in the Authorization header of HTTP requests.'
  - 'TrackMe API requires read and write permissions to objects in the TrackMe namespace,
    with a builtin role `trackme_admin` available that defines the necessary accesses.
    Authentication supports two approaches: basic auth using username and password
    (curl -u flag), or token-based auth by first obtaining a sessionKey from the /services/auth/login
    endpoint with username and password form parameters, then using that sessionKey
    token in subsequent API requests.'
