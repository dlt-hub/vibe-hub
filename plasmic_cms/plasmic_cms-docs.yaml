notes:
- Find your CMS ID, Public Token, and Secret Token in the CMS Settings tab.
- Find your model ID in the Edit models tab.
- Anyone with your secret token can edit the content in your CMS. Only use your secret
  token in secure server environments, not in public websites.
- Enforce two-factor authentication.
- Force HTTPS on all connections, so data in-transit is encrypted with TLS 1.2.
- Encrypt all database data at-rest with AES-256.
- Regularly conduct external penetration tests from third-party vendors.
- Regularly conduct security awareness training sessions with all employees.
- Have a bug bounty program, in order to work with security researchers when they
  identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- Maintain detailed audit logs of internal systems.
- The importer gets you to a starting point. You’ll need to put in further effort
  to make things production-ready.
- Plasmic doesn’t convert Figma components into Plasmic components.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 'The easiest way to get your system authenticated with Plasmic is to use our CLI
  with the following command: npx -p @plasmicapp/cli plasmic auth.'
