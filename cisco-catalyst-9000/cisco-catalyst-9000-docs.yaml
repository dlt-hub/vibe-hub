notes:
- Automation is no longer a luxury but a necessity in modern network management.
- By embracing automation, IT teams can shift their focus from mundane tasks to driving
  innovation and delivering value to the business.
- When querying network devices, there is a limit of 500 results.
- You first have to enable RestConf and Https.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Example syntax for Catalyst API calls differs from CSR1000 routers.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
