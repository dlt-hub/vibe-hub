notes:
- API keys are recommended for security and ethical reasons over third-party reverse
  proxies.
- Character Info is optional but recommended for a good character.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- By default, Chub AI matches lorebook keywords with case-insensitivity and whole
  word matching.
- Setup API required to communicate with the character.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- 'INVALID_TOKEN: Recheck the authentication token'
- 'CHAT_NOT_FOUND: Ensure the chat ID is correct'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
