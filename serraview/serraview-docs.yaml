  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization HTTP header. Include
    the header as "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" where {accessToken} is your
    access token string.'
  - 'OAuth2 JWT-bearer flow is used. Construct a JWT signed with your private key
    (with nbf and exp claims), then POST it to /oauth2/token with grant_type "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"
    and assertion parameter containing the JWT string to obtain an access_token. Include
    the access token in subsequent API requests via the Authorization: Bearer header.
    TLS 1.2 or higher is required.'
  - The API uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT Bearer grant type for authentication. To obtain
    an access token, send a POST request to /oauth2/token with grant_type set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
    and an assertion parameter containing a signed JWT. The JWT must include iss (issuer),
    aud (audience as the token endpoint URL), exp (expiration time), and nbf (not
    before time) claims. The response includes an access_token with token_type Bearer
    and expires_in value in seconds. Use the returned access_token in subsequent requests
    via the Authorization header with Bearer scheme.
  - Use JWT bearer token authentication. To obtain an access token, make an HTTP POST
    request to https://[instance].serraview.com/oauth2/token with URL-encoded parameters
    grant_type set to urn:ietf:params:oauth2:grant-type:jwt-bearer and assertion set
    to the signed JWT token. The access token is then used in subsequent API calls.

  - The Serraview Core API uses OAuth 2.0 service-to-service flow with JSON Web Tokens
    (JWTs) for authentication. External applications must follow the OAuth 2.0 flow
    to obtain access tokens, which are then used as JWTs to authenticate API requests.
