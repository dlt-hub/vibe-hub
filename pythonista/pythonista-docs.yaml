notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Cookies are limited to 4 KB of text in most browsers.
- Cookies are stored at client side and are not encrypted in any way.
- Uses Bottle framework for web applications
- Some users configure their browsers to not accept cookies at all.
- Cookies are easily forged by malicious clients.
- Signed cookies are not encrypted and not copy-protected.
- Plugins can be installed application-wide or for specific routes.
- Uses GET method for basic routing
- POST method is used for form submissions
- Bottle does not depend on any external libraries.
- Requires Python 2.5 or newer.
- Never store confidential information in cookies.
- Debug mode is helpful during early development.
- Auto reloader restarts server on file changes.
- There is no built-in support for sessions because there is no right way to do it.
- WSGI does not easily lend itself to keep-alive requests.
- Bottle is a micro framework designed for prototyping and building small web applications
  and services.
- It misses some advanced features and ready-to-use solutions found in other frameworks
  (MVC, ORM, form validation, scaffolding, XML-RPC).
- Cookies can be easily forged by the client.
- Form fields transmitted via POST are stored in BaseRequest.forms.
- 'Warning: Do not render untrusted templates! They may contain and execute harmful
  python code.'
- The Debug Mode is very helpful during early development, but should be switched
  off for public applications.
- A single Python process can utilize only one CPU at a time, even if there are more
  CPU cores available.
- To get your application available to the outside world, specify the IP of the interface
  the server should listen to.
- Bottle automatically pickles and unpickles any data stored to signed cookies.
- Plugins are disabled for proxy-routes by default but can be re-activated.
- To affect individual routes of a sub-application, the plugin must be installed explicitly.
- The Debug Mode is helpful during early development, but should be switched off for
  public applications.
- Cookies are not encrypted and can be easily forged by malicious clients.
- Just make sure not to use the debug mode on a production server.
- Changes in template files will not trigger a reload.
- No built-in support for sessions
- Bottle catches all exceptions to prevent crashes
- Do not render untrusted templates! They may contain and execute harmful python code.
- Instead of a single Bottle application server, you start one instance for each CPU
  core available using different local port (localhost:8080, 8081, 8082, ...).
- One of the fastest load balancers available is Pound but most common web servers
  have a proxy-module that can do the work just fine.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'NameError: Accessing undefined variables in a template raises NameError and stops
  rendering immediately.'
