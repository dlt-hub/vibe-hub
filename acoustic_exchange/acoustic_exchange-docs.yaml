  - Basic authentication is used for API requests. Set the Authorization header with
    basic auth credentials in the format `AcousticAPIKey:{API key value}`. The response
    includes a `Set-Cookie` header with an `x-acoustic-auth-token` value that can
    be used to authenticate subsequent requests instead of resending basic auth credentials
    each time.
  - Use HTTP Basic Authentication with username "AcousticAPIKey" (case-sensitive)
    and your generated API key as the password. Send a POST request to the login endpoint
    with the x-ibm-dx-tenant-id header. The response includes a Set-Cookie header
    with x-acoustic-auth-token, which you then include as a header in subsequent API
    requests for authentication.
