auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.nudge.net/article/38-nudge-api-documentation:
  - API key authentication is required for all requests. Generate an API key from
    the Nudge Platform (Configuration > API Management > Create new API Key), and
    include it in requests to the API Gateway at https://app.nudge.net/v1. The API
    key does not expire unless manually deleted and should be stored securely. The
    exact header name or parameter name for submitting the API key is not specified
    in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'API key authentication is required via the Authorization header. Include the
    header ''Authorization: <API_KEY>'' with your API key value in all requests to
    the /Nudge/Send and /v1/ContactData/Import endpoints.'
  - API key authentication is required. After signing up, users receive a system-generated,
    unique API key from the Nudge Platform that must be kept secure and used in API
    requests for operations like importing contacts, scheduling nudges, and sending
    real-time nudges. The documentation indicates the key is included in API requests
    but does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or transmission method
    in the provided excerpt.
  - 'Authorization is performed using an API key passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header Authorization: <API_KEY> where <API_KEY> is your actual API
    key value.'
  - 'The API is authorized using an API key passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header ''Authorization: <API_KEY>'' in your request to authenticate. The API
    key should be obtained from your Nudge account and provided as a Bearer token
    or direct key value in the Authorization header.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.nudge.net/article/38-nudge-api-documentation:
  - Skip and Top parameters enable offset-based pagination. Skip (default 0) specifies
    the number of records to skip, and Top (default 0) specifies the maximum number
    of records to return per request. The response includes totalCount indicating
    total available records.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with Skip and Top query parameters in the
    request body. Skip specifies the starting position (default 0), and Top specifies
    the number of records to return (example shows 10). The response includes a totalCount
    field indicating total available records, allowing clients to calculate remaining
    pages.
