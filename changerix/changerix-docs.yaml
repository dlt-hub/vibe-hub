auth_info:
- information_source; https://changerix.com/api/documentation:
  - The API requires an API key for authentication. The error response "Invalid api
    key" indicates that an api_key parameter must be included in the POST request
    parameters. Additionally, a signature parameter (described as "a hash signature
    to verify your payment") is required in the IPN callback validation, though the
    exact mechanism for generating or validating this signature is not fully detailed
    in the provided documentation.
