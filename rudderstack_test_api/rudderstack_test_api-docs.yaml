  - 'API tokens are passed in the Authorization header using Bearer scheme format
    (Authorization: Bearer your-api-token-here). OAuth 2.0 is also supported as an
    industry-standard protocol for limited access. API keys are unique identifiers
    that authenticate requests, often combined with secrets. Credentials must be stored
    in environment variables, never hardcoded, with separate credentials maintained
    for development and production environments. Token refresh logic should be implemented
    for OAuth flows.'

  - 'Use page-based pagination with query parameters: page (current page number) and
    per_page (items per page, default 50). Response includes pagination object with
    page, per_page, total count, and next_page field; stop when next_page is null
    or absent.'
- information_source; https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/data-catalog-api/data-catalog/:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a page query parameter (optional, positive
    integer, default 1) to specify which page of results to return. The API returns
    a maximum of 50 pages. Response structure includes a data array containing paginated
    entries; continue requesting with incremented page values until reaching the last
    page or maximum page limit.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters. Request pagination
    using currentPage (page number, default 1) and pageSize (items per page, default
    50). Response includes total (total number of entries), currentPage (current page
    number), and pageSize (maximum items per page). Stop paginating when currentPage
    * pageSize >= total.
  - The API uses query parameter `page` (optional, default 1, must be positive integer)
    to paginate results. The API returns a maximum of 50 pages. The response includes
    paginated data entries, and you construct the next request by incrementing the
    page parameter until reaching the maximum page limit.
  - Use offset and limit query parameters to paginate results. Response includes total
    (total number of entries), currentPage (current page number), and pageSize (maximum
    items per page). Stop paginating when currentPage reaches the last page or when
    returned items are fewer than pageSize.
