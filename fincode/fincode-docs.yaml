auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.fincode.jp/api:
  - 'API authentication requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header
    along with a Tenant Shop ID in the Tenant-Shop-Id header. The Bearer token is
    your Secret API Key, and both headers are required for requests.


    Authorization header: "Authorization: Bearer <Secret API Key>"

    Tenant-Shop-Id header: "Tenant-Shop-Id: <Tenant Shop ID>"

    Supported auth schemes: Secret-Bearer-Auth and Secret-Basic-Auth'
  - 'API supports two authentication methods: Secret-Bearer-Auth (send API key in
    Authorization header as "Bearer <Secret API Key>") or Secret-Basic-Auth (HTTP
    basic authentication). The Tenant-Shop-Id header is also required and should contain
    the shop identifier (format: s_****).'
  - API uses either Secret-Bearer-Auth or Secret-Basic-Auth for authorization. Secret-Bearer-Auth
    requires a bearer token in the Authorization header. Secret-Basic-Auth requires
    base64-encoded credentials in the Authorization header. The Tenant-Shop-Id header
    with value format s_**** is also required.
  - API uses one of two bearer token authentication schemes. Send either Secret-Bearer-Auth
    (bearer token in Authorization header) or Secret-Basic-Auth (base64-encoded credentials
    in Authorization header). Additionally, include the Tenant-Shop-Id header with
    the shop identifier in all requests.
  - Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization:Bearer <Secret API Key>" in requests to the API.

- information_source; https://docs.fincode.jp/api:
  - Pagination uses limit and page query parameters. Response includes total_count,
    last_page, current_page, limit, link_next, and link_previous fields to navigate
    pages. Stop when current_page equals last_page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit and page. Response includes total_count,
    last_page, current_page, limit, link_next, and link_previous fields to navigate
    pages. Use link_next or link_previous URLs from the response to fetch subsequent
    or previous pages, or construct requests with page parameter incremented/decremented
    with the same limit value.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (optional, defaults to 1) and limit (optional)
    to request pages. Response includes total_count for total items, last_page for
    total pages, and current_page for current page number. Increment page parameter
    to fetch subsequent pages until current_page equals last_page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page and limit. The response includes link_next
    and link_previous fields containing full URLs to navigate between pages. Construct
    subsequent requests using these provided URLs.
  - Request parameters include limit (query, optional, controls page size) and page
    (query, optional, for page number). Response includes total_count (total records),
    last_page (final page number), current_page (current page), limit (records per
    page), link_next (URL for next page), and link_previous (URL for previous page).
    Stop paginating when current_page equals last_page.
