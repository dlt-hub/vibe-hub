notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Specifications are subject to change without notice
- Completely standalone, untethered operation.
- Uses open source, REST-based API for integrations.
- The HDMI output is currently constrained to operate only in the configurations shown
  in the table below.
- Support for more configurations will be added in a future software release.
- When the sensor is configured to 8 bits per pixel, the frame rate must be less than
  1301 FPS for the HDMI output to work.
- Playback of recorded footage via HDMI out inactive
- HDMI output is unscaled, HDMI monitor must support the exact record resolution
- Gamma correction is not applied to built-in LCD and HDMI outputs
- USB-C Port 1 Device Mode direct to computer connection incompatible with Windows
- USB-C Network Adapters must be reconnected to camera on camera power cycle
- Performing a forced shutdown by holding the power button for 10 seconds will restart
  the camera if the button is not released immediately after 10 seconds
- Aliasing may appear when high resolution video is scaled to the built-in LCD
- 'Windows Media Player is unable to decode H.264 and H.265 videos due to a lack of
  support for 4:2:2 video. Workaround: Use VLC Media player when playing MPEG-4 video
  files'
- To connect to the camera outside of a local area network, consult your organization's
  network administrator
- Ethernet-to Fiber media extenders can be used for distances greater than 100 meters
- Both methods described allow the user to double the frame rate of the Chronos camera.
- It is better to use two monochrome cameras since they require less illumination.
- The time delay between the signal received by the camera and the recording start
  of the event takes place within 500 ns.
- This application document shows it is possible to double the frame rate using two
  Chronos cameras.
- It is better, if possible, to use two monochrome cameras since they require less
  illumination.
- Images captured can be merged more accurately as they capture the same scene.
- User needs to adjust the cameras to get the same field of view, depth of field,
  and similar image intensity.
- Enable timestamps using “Text Overlay (H.264/TIFF)” in the save settings of each
  Chronos camera. Timestamps will help facilitate cross-referencing synchronized frames.
  This feature can only be displayed for H.264 and TIFF files.
- Set saving format to H.264, if interested in saving video footage.
- Set saving format to TIFF, if interested in saving individual footage files.
- Set saving format to cinema DNG, if interested in saving raw footage files. Timestamp
  is not available for this format.
- Save footage using SMB and NFS network shares to avoid transferring footage files
  from multiple SD cards, SSDs, and USBs.
- 'Enable “Auto Save” in the Util menu to save footage immediately after ending the
  recording. Chronos 1.4 and 2.1-HD cameras can be synchronized if the frame rates
  are set to the same value or the receiver cameras have a greater frame rate than
  the transmitter camera. The camera resolution and record lengths will not directly
  impact the synchronization. Note: The transmitter camera’s frame rate will define
  the receiver’s frame rate.'
- Change the “Record length” value in the **Record Settings > Record Mode**, to reduce
  maximum footage time.
- Confirm Post-trigger values in the **Record Settings > Trigger Delay** values are
  set to zero to prevent delays when stopping a recording. In case the triggers do
  not work as expected, confirm trigger delays are correctly configured.
- Change the “Record length” value in the Record Settings > Record Mode, to reduce
  maximum footage time.
- Confirm Post-trigger values in the Record Settings > Trigger Delay values are set
  to zero to prevent delays when stopping a recording. In case the triggers do not
  work as expected, confirm trigger delays are correctly configured.
- The setup allows users to trigger multiple Chronos cameras to start and end recording
  from an external switch.
- Different resolutions, frame rates, and/or record times can be configured for each
  camera.
- Users can trigger multiple Chronos cameras independently.
- Synchronization methods apply to different combinations of Chronos cameras.
- Enable timestamps using 'Text Overlay (H.264/TIFF)' in the save settings of each
  Chronos camera.
- Enable 'Auto Save' in the Util menu to save footage immediately after ending the
  recording.
- Change the 'Record length' value in the Record Settings > Record Mode, to reduce
  maximum footage time.
- Confirm Post-trigger values in the Record Settings > Trigger Delay values are set
  to zero to prevent delays when stopping a recording.
- Enable timestamps using “Text Overlay (H.264/TIFF)” in the save settings of each
  Chronos camera.
- Enable “Auto Save” in the Util menu to save footage immediately after ending the
  recording.
- Chronos 1.4 and 2.1-HD cameras can be synchronized if the frame rates are set to
  the same value or the receiver cameras have a greater frame rate than the transmitter
  camera.
- The camera resolution and record lengths will not directly impact the synchronization.
- 'Note: The transmitter camera’s frame rate will define the receiver’s frame rate.'
- The footage requires careful setup to match the footage from the two cameras precisely.
- 'There are two important factors to take into account when producing the video:
  the amount of offset of the two sets of images and the speed at which the video
  is to be shown.'
- The Chronos 1.4 camera saves a TIFF sequence with the first two images moved to
  the back of the sequence and the third image copied at the end of the sequence.
- Both cameras must be started manually.
