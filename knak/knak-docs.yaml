auth_info:
- information_source; https://enterprise.knak.io/docs/api:
  - 'All requests require a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Tokens are obtained
    through two methods that are referenced but not detailed in this excerpt. Send
    the token as Authorization: Bearer <token> in request headers.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Client must redirect users to obtain
    an authorization code via client_id, redirect_uri, and response_type parameters,
    then exchange the code for access_token and refresh_token by posting to /oauth/token
    endpoint with grant_type=authorization_code, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri,
    and code in the request body, and include Bearer token in Authorization header.
  - 'The webhook includes three required header parameters for authentication and
    verification: knak-signature (a signature string for request verification), Knak-Version
    (version identifier, example "1.0"), and Knak-Event-Type (event type identifier,
    example "asset.sync_confirmation_responded"). These headers should be validated
    to authenticate incoming webhook requests.'
  - Webhooks are signed using SHA-256 HMAC with a secret generated in Knak. The signature
    is included in the knak-signature header of each webhook request. You need to
    obtain the secret from the Webhooks page in the Enterprise UI (stored in environment
    variable WEBHOOK_SECRET) and verify the signature by computing HMAC-SHA256 of
    the request body with the secret, then comparing it to the knak-signature header
    value to confirm the request came from Knak.
- information_source; https://enterprise.knak.io/docs/custom-validator-api:
  - The API uses a custom HTTP security header for authentication. During Integration
    Configuration in Knak, you specify a custom header name and value (referred to
    as <security-header-name> and <security-header-value>), which must be included
    in every request to your validation endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://enterprise.knak.io/docs/api:
  - Our API supports limit and offset pagination. Use the query parameters limit (optional,
    default and maximum values not specified) and offset (optional) to request specific
    pages of data. The response includes a total field indicating the total number
    of records available. Continue paginating by incrementing offset until you retrieve
    all records.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (default page=1) to navigate results. Response
    includes page (current page), last_page (total pages), per_page (items per page,
    default 10), total (total items), and links array with url and label fields for
    navigation.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (e.g., page=1). Response includes links
    object with first, last, prev, and next URLs, plus meta object with current_page,
    last_page, per_page, total count, and a links array containing navigation URLs.
    Stop paginating when reaching last_page.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (page=2 in the example). The response includes
    per_page (10 items per page), total (3 total items), to (current page end position),
    and a path field with the next page URL. Stop paginating when reaching the total
    item count.
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (starting at page 1). Response includes
    meta.current_page, meta.last_page, meta.per_page (default 10), meta.total, and
    links array with next page URLs. Stop paginating when current_page equals last_page.
