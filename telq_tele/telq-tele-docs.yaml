notes:
- Ensure to replace placeholders with actual appId and appKey.
- The TTL (Time to live) of the token is 86400 seconds (24 hours), hence the new token
  has to be re-created upon the expiration.
- Keep in mind, that this list updated frequently and it's not recommended to use
  this list to initiate tests after a long time has passed.
- Make sure to replace `000001` with your appId and `keykeykeykey` with your appKey
- This will return the list of all available networks at the current moment.
- If a callback URL is present and you provided a value for the results-callback-token
  header parameter in your tests request, the results-callback-token value will be
  included as the Authorization value on the callbacks.
- Keep in mind that this list updated frequently and it's not recommended to use this
  list to initiate tests after a long time has passed.
- Ensure to replace `000001` with your appId and `keykeykeykey` with your appKey
- The list of available networks is updated frequently and should be reloaded often.
- You are not allowed to reuse created tests and send multiple tests to the same phoneNumber
  and testIdText.
- In case of HTTP 5** server error or server unavailability during callback request,
  callbacks retries are executed with a progressive delay.
- If a callback URL is present and you provided a value for the results-callback-token
  header parameter in your tests request, the results-callback-token value will be
  included as the Authorization value on the callbacks we make to your system so your
  endpoint can validate the authenticity of the calls.
- The default number of attempts to deliver the test result on the callback is 3,
  maximum is 5.
- The system will wait for the SMS to be delivered to the device before considering
  the test NOT_DELIVERED.
- The Bearer Token for authorization must be included in the Authorization header.
- Keep in mind that the list of networks is updated frequently.
- Do not reuse created tests and send multiple tests to the same phoneNumber and testIdText.
- The Callback URL can be added within our UI in the last step of the scheduler task
  configuration.
- If a callback URL is present, the results-callback-token value will be included
  as the Authorization value on the callbacks.
- This URL is where the API will send a callback request if any reporting rules apply.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Check appId and appKey'
- '5XX Server Errors: Callbacks retries are executed with a progressive delay. The

- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck appId or appKey'
- 'NETWORK_OFFLINE: The requested network is currently unavailable.'
