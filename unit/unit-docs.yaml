auth_info:
- information_source; https://unit.co/docs/api/:
  - 'Customer tokens use Bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header
    (format: "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"). Tokens include built-in Two Factor
    Authentication (OTP) with customizable expiry up to 24 hours. Send a GET request
    to /identity endpoint with the Authorization header to retrieve decoded token
    information. Org API tokens are also supported as an alternative for accessing
    sensitive scopes without relying on customer 2FA. Scopes define the level of access
    granted to resources.'
  - 'Unit''s API uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication. All API requests must
    include an Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>". Tokens are assigned
    scopes that define accessible resources and access levels (read/write). Two token
    types exist: Org API tokens for system-level access and Customer Tokens for end-customer-specific
    access. Invalid, missing, or expired tokens result in HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses.'
- information_source; https://unit.co/docs/api/application-documents/:
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. The token must be passed in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" for all document endpoints.'
  - The API requires OAuth2 authentication with the "applications-write" scope. Include
    the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}". The required scope is "applications".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://unit.co/docs/api/cards-authorization-requests/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes a meta
    object with pagination details such as total count and whether more results are
    available. Use offset to navigate through pages by incrementing it based on the
    limit value.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page[limit] (integer, default 100, optional)
    for maximum results per page and page[offset] (integer, default 0, optional) for
    the starting position. The response returns a data array containing the paginated
    results.
- information_source; https://unit.co/docs/api/webhooks/:
  - Pagination uses query parameter page[limit] (integer type) to control the number
    of results per page. The documentation indicates paging can be applied but does
    not specify default values, maximum limits, response fields for navigation, or
    stopping conditions.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page[limit] (optional, default 100, maximum number
    of results) and page[offset] (optional, default 0, number of results to skip).
    The response returns a data array of results; construct the next request by incrementing
    page[offset] by page[limit] until fewer results than page[limit] are returned.
