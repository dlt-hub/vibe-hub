notes:
- You are allowed a maximum of 2 access tokens at a time.
- Polling the API periodically for job status is NOT recommended in a production server.
- Jobs remain accessible on the server for 30 days after completion unless the account
  is configured for a shorter auto-deletion period.
- The API will make a POST request, not a GET request, to the notification_config.url
  parameter. The request body will contain the job details.
- You can unsubscribe from a webhook by responding to the webhook request with a 200
  response code.
- If a webhook invocation does not receive a 200 response, Rev AI will retry the callback
  URL every 30 minutes until either 24 hours have passed or a 200 response code is
  received.
- Use webhooks for production scenarios to avoid polling.
- The API supports HIPAA-compliant processing. However, this feature is not activated
  by default and must be explicitly activated at account level.
- Record in a quiet setting.
- Speak clearly, loudly, and slowly.
- Avoid talking over other people.
- Use quality recording equipment, such as an external or dedicated microphone or
  recorder.
- Uses OAuth2 access token for authorization.
- Replace placeholders with actual values like access tokens and file paths.
- Webhooks provide a way to asynchronously receive notifications once a Rev AI job
  completes.
- Webhook URL is obtained from https://webhook.site/
- Deleting a voice note removes it from the application database, but does not delete
  it from Rev AI's servers.
- To reduce upload time and bandwidth consumption, the example application restricts
  each audio recording to 15 seconds.
- Files uploaded must be less than 2 GB in size.
- Media files longer than 17 hours are not supported for English transcription.
- The SendGrid API key should be configured with the Full Access privilege.
- Webhook will receive POST requests from Rev AI on job completion
- By default, job data is stored up to a maximum of 30 days.
- Changes made to job deletion settings will apply only to subsequent jobs and may
  require up to five minutes to take effect.
- Rev AI automatically adds punctuation and performs inverse text normalization on
  all audio processed.
- Diarization is performed by default on all audio processed through the Asynchronous
  Speech-to-Text API.
- Streaming concurrency limit is 10.
- Time limit per stream is 3 hours.
- Job submissions with input longer than 14000 words exceed our length restrictions
  and will fail.
- 'Clients must authenticate by including their Rev AI access token in the Authorization:
  header of their requests.'
- If the access token is invalid or the header is not present, a 401 error code will
  be returned.
- Clients must authenticate by including their Rev AI access token as a query parameter
  in their requests.
- If the access token is invalid or the query parameter is not present, a 401 error
  code will be returned.
- Polling is NOT recommended in a production server. Rather, use webhooks to asynchronously
  receive notifications once the request completes.
- Use custom vocabulary only for truly unique or rare terms that you believe are not
  in our massive dictionary of 500,000+ words.
- We recommend submitting a short list of target terms (no more than 500 phrases)
  as large lists may negatively impact performance and accuracy.
- Short phrases do better than long phrases, so keep your phrases on the short side
  if possible.
- Don't mix languages in your custom vocabulary. The Rev AI ASR model is not multilingual.
- Compile your custom vocabulary list ahead of time. This helps with asynchronous
  transcription performance.
- Re-examine your audio and custom vocabulary list periodically.
- Rev AI is HIPAA compliant now.
- All Rev AI job identifiers are now 16 characters in length (increased from 12 characters
  previously).
- Polling the API periodically for job status is NOT recommended in a production server.
  Rather, use webhooks to asynchronously receive notifications once the topic extraction
  job completes.
- Use webhooks to asynchronously receive notifications once the transcription job
  completes.
