auth_info:
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/crm-reference:
  - 'Authorization uses a Bearer token scheme. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN'' for all requests.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN" where YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN is replaced with
    your actual secret token.
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/documentation/getting-started/getting-your-api-key:
  - Authentication uses JWT tokens signed with HS512. Generate tokens server-side
    using the ROLLOUT_CLIENT_ID as the issuer claim and ROLLOUT_CLIENT_SECRET as the
    signing key. Tokens must include iss, sub, iat, and exp claims, with expiration
    set to 15 minutes. The Client Secret should never be exposed to the client; token
    generation must occur on your server.
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/documentation/getting-started/show-the-authentication-ui/react-17-and-newer:
  - A token-based authentication approach is used where a token is fetched from your
    server endpoint and passed to the RolloutLinkProvider component. The token should
    be generated server-side using ROLLOUT_CLIENT_SECRET to keep the secret secure,
    then provided to the client via a fetch call to your "/rollout-token" endpoint
    that returns JSON with a "token" field.
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/documentation/getting-started/making-api-requests:
  - 'All API requests require two authentication components: a Bearer token in the
    Authorization header (the authToken generated previously) and a credential ID
    in the x-rollout-credential-id header (the Rollout-generated credential ID for
    the user). The credential ID can be obtained either via the onCredentialAdded
    hook callback when rendering Rollout Link authentication UI, or by querying the
    https://universal.rollout.com/api/credentials endpoint with the Authorization
    Bearer token header to retrieve the user''s credentials list and extracting the
    id field from the response.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/crm-reference:
  - The /people endpoint uses query parameter pagination with next (string, optional),
    offset (string or numeric, optional, default 0), and limit (number, optional).
    The response includes a people array; use the next value from the response in
    subsequent requests to paginate through results.
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/tms-reference:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: next (continuation token), offset
    (starting position, default 0), and limit (number of results per page, default
    0). Use the next value from the response to fetch subsequent pages; stop when
    next is empty or null.'
  - The /people endpoint uses offset-limit pagination with an optional next cursor.
    Request parameters include offset (query, numeric string, default 0), limit (query,
    numeric string, default 0), and next (query, string) for cursor-based navigation.
    Response structure for pagination fields is not documented in the provided excerpt.
  - 'The /people endpoint uses query parameter-based pagination with three parameters:
    next (for pagination token), offset (for starting position), and limit (for result
    count per page). Use the next value from the response to fetch subsequent pages.'
- information_source; https://guides.rollout.com/los-reference:
  - 'The /users endpoint supports cursor-based and offset-based pagination using query
    parameters: next (string cursor for next page), offset (numeric, default 0), and
    limit (number for page size). Use the next value from the response to request
    subsequent pages, and stop when next is not returned or is empty.'
