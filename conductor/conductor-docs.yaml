auth_info:
- information_source; https://conductor-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/:
  - The token is passed in the URL path as a path parameter (<<token>>) in requests
    to /api/activity/success/<<token>>, /api/activity/fail/<<token>>, and DELETE /api/activity/<<token>>.
    The token serves as the authentication mechanism for workers to submit activity
    results and release tokens.
- information_source; https://conductor-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/primitives/:
  - The documentation describes activity token handling and response submission. A
    token is issued to workers for future requests, included in the response body
    as `token`, and expires at the time specified in `tokenExpiry`. Workers submit
    activity results by POST request with the token in the URL path, sending response
    data in the request body.
