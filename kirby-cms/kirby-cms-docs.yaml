notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- You need to be logged in to access the API.
- The API authentication can be set up for users without panel access.
- You can create custom 'API endpoints' instead of the general routes.
- We paginate the list of articles with `->paginate(10)`.
- The pagination object also provides some simple methods, which will build URLs for
  the previous and next pages.
- Apache works out of the box.
- For PHP's built-in server, start it with Kirby's router.
- Every API request requires authentication.
- In a multi-language site, it is necessary to specify the language with the X-Language
  header.
- Session-based authentication requires CSRF token validation.
- Basic auth is only available over HTTPS.
- Every request to the REST API requires authentication.
- It is not recommended to use HTTP Basic Auth in combination with JavaScript front-ends,
  as you will be exposing your credentials.
- Routes can be setup with the routes option in your config or in plugins.
- Replace api-key with the API key you got for your app.
- The endpoint is automatically protected with the same authentication layer as our
  own endpoints.
- Fields are defined with the props array.
- API response includes properties defined in blueprints.
errors:
- not authorized to access panel
- '404: The page "example" cannot be found'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck credentials or CSRF token.'
