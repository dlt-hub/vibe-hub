notes:
- The registry can register classes as well as functions.
- To use a module from a sibling node, specify the scope prefix in the type.
- The key to trigger the registry mechanism is to make the module imported.
- This is an experimental feature, and its interface is subject to change.
- Runner simplifies the construction of training, validation, and testing pipelines.
- Modules are lazily initialized, meaning they are built only when needed in the current
  loop.
- CustomRunner is prepared to be used by setting runner_type='CustomRunner' in your
  config file.
- Uses runner to cover all aspects for structured training process
- The runner manages all modules in MMEngine.
- You can modify or add your codes without spoiling your whole codebase.
