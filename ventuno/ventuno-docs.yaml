auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.ventunotech.com/:
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 bearer token flow. Obtain an access token by sending
    client_id and client_secret to POST /auth/token, which returns an access_token
    with token_type "bearer" and expires_in 3600 seconds. Send the access_token in
    the HTTP Authorization header as a bearer token for subsequent API requests. Token
    TTL can be extended to 60 minutes by calling /auth/token again with the same credentials.
  - 'Authentication uses a bearer token. Include the token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.ventunotech.com/:
  - Pagination is controlled via request body parameters page_no (page number, required)
    and no_of_items (rows per page, required). The response includes total_items in
    the summary section indicating total count, and you increment page_no to fetch
    subsequent pages until all items are retrieved.
  - 'Pagination is controlled via request body parameters: page_no (required, integer)
    specifies the current page and no_of_items (required, integer) specifies rows
    per page. The response includes a paging object with next and previous objects
    containing page_no values for navigation, plus no_of_items indicating the current
    page size.'
  - 'Pagination is handled via request body parameters: page_no (integer, required)
    specifies the page number starting from 1, and no_of_items (integer, required)
    specifies the number of rows per page. The response includes a total_items field
    indicating total available items; continue requesting with incremented page_no
    until no more data is returned.'
  - Pagination uses a page_no parameter in the response. The paging object contains
    next and previous fields, each with a page_no value indicating the next or previous
    page number, along with no_of_items showing items per page (50). Construct subsequent
    requests by using the page_no values from next or previous to navigate pages.
  - Pagination uses page_no (integer, in request body, required) and no_of_items (integer,
    in request body, specifying rows per page). Response includes paging object with
    next field containing page_no for the next page; stop paginating when next is
    not returned.
