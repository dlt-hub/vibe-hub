auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.zerotier.com/api/central/v1/:
  - 'All API requests require a bearer token in the Authorization header. Generate
    an API token by logging into ZeroTier Central and creating a token on the Account
    page, then include it as Authorization: token xxxxx in request headers.'
  - 'Requests to the ZeroTier API require tokenAuth authorization. The token must
    be provided as a bearer token in the Authorization header (typically as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>"), though the exact header format is not explicitly detailed in
    this documentation excerpt.'
  - Requests to this API require tokenAuth authorization. The tokenAuth scheme uses
    an API token that must be provided with each request. Tokens are managed per user
    and can be added via the /user/{userID}/token endpoint. The exact mechanism for
    sending the token (header name, query parameter, etc.) is not specified in this
    documentation excerpt.
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication called "tokenAuth". Clients must include
    a bearer token in the Authorization header to access protected endpoints. The
    token is obtained by creating an API token through the user token management endpoints
    and should be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in requests.'
  - The API uses token-based authentication called tokenAuth. Credentials must be
    sent as a bearer token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer {token}"
    to access protected endpoints like organization invitations and account status.
