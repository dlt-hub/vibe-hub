auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/data-fetching/:
  - 'The GitHub GraphQL API requires authentication via a bearer token. Include the
    token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer your-github-token".
    You can store the token in an environment variable to avoid hardcoding it in public
    repositories.'
  - Use a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Create a GitHub personal
    access token and add it to the Authorization header as `Bearer your-github-token`
    in the gatsby-source-graphql plugin configuration under the headers option in
    gatsby-config.js.
- information_source; https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/security-in-gatsby/:
  - 'API keys and tokens should be stored in build environment variables, not in client-side
    code. When accessing APIs that require authentication, use environment variables
    (e.g., process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN) and pass credentials via Authorization headers
    with the Bearer scheme, as shown in the GitHub GraphQL example where the header
    format is Authorization: Bearer ${token}.'
