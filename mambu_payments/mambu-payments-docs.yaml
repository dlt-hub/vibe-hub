notes:
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) uses integers in all payment and transaction amount
  attributes in API requests and responses as well as events. Customers should then
  translates amounts accordingly.
- Most currencies have two decimals, but some have zero and others have three.
- Connectivity syncs are now available in the dashboard
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) enables Bacs indirect participants to connect
  to their sponsor bank and support all Bacs payment flows.
- Requires setup of API key for access
- SDD payment orders approved will be batched into a payment file and sent to the
  bank.
- You should always first analyse and fix the webhook error and then, use the retry
  failed events API endpoint to re-send failed event and resume the events processing
- Requires API Key for authentication.
- The process is asynchronous, meaning the response indicates pending_verification
  with all verifications set to null.
- Numeral then gathers results from the different sources. This process can take up
  to 30 seconds.
- Status updates are notified by events that can be retrieved using the API or received
  through webhooks.
- Bulk actions support up to 5,000 items.
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) can automatically create payment orders that failed.
- You should always first analyse and fix the webhook error and then, use the retry
  failed events API endpoint to re-send failed event and resume the events processing.
- Custom fields can be used to add your own categories and attributes to resources.
- CSV separator used is ';'. Make sure to escape this character or encapsulate all
  strings that could include this character with double quotes.
- Relationships between return requests and payment orders are preserved via related_payment_id
  and related_payment_type fields.
- Bulk actions enable you to create or modify multiple items with a single API request.
- The bulk action API endpoint is asynchronous.
- Payment validation is used to approve or reject payments before they are sent or
  when they are received.
- Validations are managed via payment validation rules that group and orchestrate
  the execution of validations.
- SEPA rulebooks mandate the debtor PSP to notify its customer that the funds have
  been credited on the beneficiary's account.
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) actively participates in the EPC's RVM information
  sessions and intends to participate in the EPC's pilot phases.
- Files can contain up to 100,000 entries each
- CSV separator used is ';'.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Relationships between return requests and payment orders are preserved via `related_payment_id`
  and `related_payment_type` fields.
- Webhooks sent by Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) will always originate from the
  same IPs.
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) manages the validations based on your configuration.
- Accurate account holder name matching is crucial for a robust VOP implementation.
- An overly strict matching algorithm can lead to legitimate payments being rejected.
- The SEPA 2025 rulebooks mandate the debtor PSP to notify its customer that that
  the funds have been credited on the beneficiary's account.
- Webhooks sent by Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) will always originate from the
  same IPs. We recommend whitelisting these IPs.
- Mambu Payments has partnered with CertEurope for QWAC procurement
- Starting from March 3rd, 2025, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required to
  login to the Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) dashboard.
- Do not share API keys in publicly accessible areas.
- If your API key gets compromised, you can disable it and create a new one directly
  from the Mambu Payments dashboard.
- API keys can always approve a payment order which is pending approval, with or without
  an approval rule
- In order to enable certificate rotation with no service interruption, you can manage
  up to 2 QWAC PSD2 certificates in Mambu Payments.
- In sandbox, IP whitelisting is not available and mTLS is optional.
- mTLS and IP whitelisting cannot be combined in production.
- All API requests must be made over HTTPS with a valid API key.
- API requests made over plain HTTP will be rejected.
- API requests sent without a valid API key will be rejected.
- This signature base is the string which will be signed, so you must respect the
  format (e.g., respect every character like ", @, or " " for instance).
- In order to prevent replay attacks, API signatures are valid for 5 minutes only.
- Payment orders will be created asynchronously after uploading a payment file.
- Uses API key for authentication — requires setup of API key.
- The maximum number of events in a batch is currently set to 100 for deliverability
  and performance reasons.
- The event will be set to pending_retry status and re-sent up to 5 times during a
  ~2.8-hour period using an exponential back-off strategy.
- In sandbox, IP whitelisting is not available and mTLS is optional. This means customers
  can authenticate their requests using an API key as a single level of authentication.
- Mambu Payments (formerly Numeral) may rotate its public keys over time.
- In real scenario, these would come from HTTP headers
- Uses RSA with SHA-256 for signature verification.
- Signing API requests is optional but strongly recommended.
- We store multiple keys in a map keyed by their 'keyid', for rotation
- API signatures are valid for 5 minutes only.
- Requires setup of connected app in Numeral API
- In a real environment, you'd likely have distinct keys for each keyid.
- Uses RSA-SHA256 PKCS#1 v1.5 for signature verification.
- 'Skipping label: no created param found.'
- 'Skipping label: no keyid param found.'
- 'Skipping label: no signature found.'
- 'Skipping label: no public key for keyid='
- Order is defined as the order of events for a given object, based on its lifecycle.
