pagination_info:
- information_source; https://vendor.utahrealestate.com/webapi/docs/tuts/query-options:
  - Pagination uses $skip and $top query parameters. $top specifies the maximum number
    of records to return (default 200), and $skip specifies the number of records
    to skip for offset-based pagination. The response includes @odata.count for total
    record count when $count=true is used. For large datasets, ordering by indexed
    fields or primary keys is recommended to improve performance.
  - Pagination uses $top and $skip query parameters. $top specifies records per request
    with a maximum limit of 200 records. $skip offsets the result set; increment $skip
    by 200 for each subsequent request to retrieve additional pages. Stop when fewer
    than 200 records are returned.
