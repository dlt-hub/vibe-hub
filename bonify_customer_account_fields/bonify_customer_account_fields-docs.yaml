  - 'API authentication requires two custom headers in every request: x-shop-domain
    (your Shopify domain, format: your-domain.myshopify.com) and x-api-key (your API
    key). Include both headers in all requests to the base URL https://apps.bonify.io/apps/cf_app/public-api/customer_fields/v2/...
    Requests with an incorrect API key will return a 403 Forbidden status with an
    error response.'
  - The API requires two custom headers for authentication. Send x-shop-domain set
    to your Shopify domain (your-domain.myshopify.com) and x-api-key set to your API
    key obtained from the API Key page. Both headers must be included in every request.

  - The API requires two custom headers for authentication. Send x-shop-domain with
    your shop domain (e.g., your-domain.myshopify.com) and x-api-key with your API

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://customer-account-fields.docs.bonify.io/article/467-rest-api-v2:
  - Use cursor-based pagination by passing the `next_page` cursor value from the previous
    response as a query parameter `?next_page=[cursor]` in the next request. The `next_page`
    field in the response indicates the cursor for the next page; pagination is complete
    when `next_page` is not returned. Note that `page_count` and `total_count` are
    no longer available in responses due to Shopify API limitations.
  - Use cursor-based pagination with the next_page field. Pass the next_page value
    from the response as a query parameter in the subsequent request to retrieve the
    next batch of customers. Maximum 50 results returned per request; when next_page
    is absent, all results have been retrieved.
- information_source; https://customer-account-fields.docs.bonify.io/article/95-api:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (default is 1) to specify which page to
    return. The response includes page_count and total_count fields; if page_count
    is 0 or no more pages exist, there are no additional pages to fetch.
  - The GET /customers endpoint uses offset-based pagination with a maximum of 50
    results per request. Request pagination via optional query parameter "page" (defaults
    to 1). Response includes "page_count" (total pages), "total_count" (total customers),
    and "next_page" (next page number or null when on last page). Construct next request
    by incrementing the page parameter until next_page is null.
