auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804661570--Getting-Started-with-the-API:
  - Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    The token should be provided as "Bearer {access_token}" where access_token is
    obtained separately (referenced as sltoken or $sltoken in environment variables).
    The token is sent via the Authorization request header.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}". The access_token variable should contain a
    valid token; if you receive an error response, the token may have expired and
    needs to be refreshed.
  - Smartling API uses credential-based authentication via POST request to acquire
    a Bearer token. Send userIdentifier and userSecret as JSON in the request body
    to https://api.smartling.com/auth-api/v2/authenticate, which returns an accessToken
    in the response. Use the accessToken as a Bearer token in subsequent API calls.
    Credentials are typically stored in environment variables DEV_USER_IDENTIFIER
    and DEV_USER_SECRET.
  - 'The access token received from a previous authentication step must be stored
    in an environment variable named `sltoken` and then passed as a Bearer token in
    the `Authorization` header for API requests. The header format is `Authorization:
    Bearer $sltoken` where `$sltoken` contains the access token value extracted from
    the `accessToken` field in the authentication response.'
- information_source; https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804661570-Getting-Started-with-the-API:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" where access_token is obtained
    through Smartling''s authentication flow. The token must be included in all API
    requests to the files-api endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260805176869-Pagination:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the starting position (default 0), and limit specifies the number of items per
    page. The response includes totalCount and items fields; increment offset by limit
    for the next page until the returned item count is less than the limit value.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the starting position (default 0), and limit specifies the number of results per
    page. The response includes totalCount in the data object; stop paginating when
    offset plus limit exceeds totalCount.
  - Request parameters `limit` (maximum items to return) and `offset` (index of first
    item, defaults to 0) control pagination. For strings-api endpoints, `totalCount`
    in the response indicates items in the current response; continue paginating with
    incremented offset until `totalCount` is less than `limit`. For other endpoints,
    `totalCount` represents total result set size across all pages.
- information_source; https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412947322267-Python-SDK:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (default 0), limit specifies maximum results per page (default 50 in
    example). Response includes data.items containing the paginated results. Iterate
    by incrementing offset by limit value until fewer results than limit are returned.
