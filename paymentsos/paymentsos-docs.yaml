auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/apis/payments/1.3.0/:
  - 'API key and private key authentication via headers. The request requires three
    authentication-related headers: app-id (required), private-key (required), and
    authorization (required, Bearer token format). Additionally, api-version (required)
    and x-payments-os-env (optional, defaults to "live") headers are needed for proper
    request routing.'
  - API key authentication using app-id and private-key headers, or alternatively
    app-id header with bearerAuth token. Both approaches require the app-id header;
    the first uses private-key for signing/authentication, and the second uses a bearer
    token in the Authorization header.
  - 'API requests require one of two authentication methods: app-id with private-key
    headers, or app-id with bearer token in the authorization header. Required headers
    include app-id, private-key (for first method) or authorization with Bearer token
    (for second method), plus api-version.'
  - 'API requires one of two authentication methods: either app-id and private-key
    headers, or app-id header with bearer token in the authorization header. Required
    headers are app-id, private-key (for first method) or authorization with Bearer
    token (for second method).'
  - 'API requires one of two authentication methods: either app-id and private-key

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/apis/payments/1.3.0/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies the number
    of results to return, and offset specifies the number of results to skip. The
    response is an array of payment method objects.
- information_source; https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/management-api/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (integer, default 10) and page (integer,
    default 0) to control page size and page number. The response includes a metadata
    object containing pagination state information.
  - The response includes a paging object with total_count, total_pages, limit, and
    page fields. Use the page parameter (query or path) to request specific pages,
    starting from page 1, up to the total_pages value returned in the response.
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata with the following fields: total_count
    (total number of roles), limit (items per page, default 10), page (current page
    index starting at 0), and total_pages (total number of pages). Use the page parameter
    in subsequent requests to navigate through pages.'
  - Use query parameters page (integer, default 0) and limit (integer, default 10)
    to paginate results. The response includes a paging object that indicates pagination
    state for navigating through connected accounts.
