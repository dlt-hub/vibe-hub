auth_info:
- information_source; https://engagedly.github.io/api-docs/:
  - Each API call requires authentication using a client key and secret key obtained
    from the Engagedly Portal (Integrations > Engagedly API section). Both credentials
    must be included as HTTP headers named ClientKey and SecretKey in every request.
    The secret key is displayed only once upon generation and carries the permissions
    of the Site Administrator user who created it.
  - 'Engagedly API uses two required headers for authentication: ClientKey and SecretKey.
    Both headers must be included in every API request. Send the ClientKey and SecretKey
    values as HTTP headers named "ClientKey" and "SecretKey" respectively.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://engagedly.github.io/api-docs/:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters page and size (defaults: page 1, size
    25). Response includes pagination object with page, size, has_more boolean, and
    total_records count. Stop paginating when has_more is false.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 1, default) and size (default
    25, max 50) to control which page and how many items per page. The response includes
    a pagination object containing the provided page and size values, plus has_more
    (boolean indicating more items exist) and record_count (total number of records).
  - Pagination uses query parameters page and size to request data. The response includes
    pagination object with page (current page number), size (records per page), has_more
    (boolean indicating if more pages exist), and total_records (total count). Continue
    paginating while has_more is true, incrementing the page parameter for each request.
  - The API uses page-based pagination with page and size parameters in the response.
    The pagination object returns page (current page number, starting at 1) and size
    (items per page), allowing clients to construct subsequent requests by incrementing
    the page parameter.
  - The List all job titles endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameters
    page (default 1) and size (default 30). The response includes a pagination object
    with page, size, has_more (boolean), and total_records fields to indicate pagination
    state and navigate through pages.
