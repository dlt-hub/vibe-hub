- information_source; https://docs.nacelle.com/docs/ingest-rest-api:
  - 'The Ingest REST API requires three custom headers for authentication: x-nacelle-space-id
    (found in Space ID section of dashboard), x-nacelle-source-id (found in Source
    ID for Custom section), and x-nacelle-ingest-token (generated via Create New Key
    button in Nacelle''s platform dashboard under Space Settings -> API Details).
    All three headers must be included in every request to https://ingest.api.nacelle.com/.'
- information_source; https://docs.nacelle.com/reference/api-reference:
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for authorization. Access tokens are required for both Orders
    API and Storefront GraphQL API. Tokens are generated via the Nacelle Dashboard
    (Space Settings > API Details > Generate Credential button) or programmatically
    using the Create a Nacelle Credential API. Each token is displayed only once and
    must be saved securely. Tokens are sent as OAuth access tokens in requests to
    maintain secure access to Nacelle APIs. For detailed setup, see the Client Credentials
    and Access Tokens documentation pages referenced.
