auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.emby.media/doc/restapi/Emby-Connect.html:
  - Emby Connect uses a two-stage token exchange process. First, authenticate with
    Emby Connect using X-Application and X-Connect-UserToken headers to retrieve an
    AccessKey per server. Then exchange that AccessKey with each Emby Server by sending
    a GET to /Connect/Exchange with X-Emby-Token set to the AccessKey and X-Emby-Authorization
    header, receiving back a LocalUserId and AccessToken for use on that server's
    other endpoints.
  - 'Emby Connect uses two authentication methods. For username/password login, POST
    to https://connect.emby.media/service/user/authenticate with JSON body containing
    nameOrEmail and rawpw fields, and X-Application header (format: AppName/AppVersion);
    the response includes ConnectAccessToken and ConnectUserId. For subsequent API
    calls, include X-Application and X-Connect-UserToken headers with the ConnectUserToken
    value.'
- information_source; https://dev.emby.media/doc/restapi/User-Authentication.html:
  - Authentication is performed by POSTing to /Users/Authenticatebyname with the password
    sent as pw in the request body. The response includes an AccessToken property
    that must be included in all subsequent requests using the X-Emby-Token header.
    A 401 response indicates the token has been revoked and the user should be redirected
    to login. Tokens can be invalidated by POSTing to /Sessions/Logout. For multi-server
    applications, store the token with the server's Id to ensure the correct token
    is sent to each server.
- information_source; https://dev.emby.media/doc/restapi/index.html:
  - 'Emby Server API supports two authentication methods: User Authentication (username
    and password login) and API Key Authentication (static token). The specific implementation
    details for headers, parameter names, and token formats are documented in separate
    User Authentication and API Key Authentication pages.'
