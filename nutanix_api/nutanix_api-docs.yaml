- TCP 22 is used for SSH access to the Controller VMs (CVMs) and AHV hosts.
- TCP 2074 is used for communication between the CVM and guest VMs for NGT.
- Ports TCP 9463, 9361, 9362 are used for secure communication between Prism Central
  and Prism Element.

  minimizing any security vulnerabilities.
- Foundation Central allows the creation of only one API key per second to avoid any
  Denial of Service (DOS) attack.
- If you host Metis on a laptop, make sure that the laptop stays running and connected
  throughout the entire process.
