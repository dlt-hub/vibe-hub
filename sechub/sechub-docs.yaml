    number) and totalPages (total available pages) fields to indicate pagination state.
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: page (current page, zero-indexed), totalPages
    (total number of pages), and content (array of results). Use the page field to
    track position and stop when page reaches totalPages minus one.'
