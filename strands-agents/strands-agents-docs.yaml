notes:
- To run this example hello world agent you will need to set up credentials for our
  model provider and enable model access.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Handles the extraction of metadata from Python functions including function name
  and description from docstrings.
- Application code is deployed only during the initial instance creation via user
  data script
- Updating the application requires implementing a custom update mechanism
- Application is exposed directly on port 8000 without a load balancer
- Swarms include several safety mechanisms to prevent infinite loops and ensure reliable
  execution
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- AgentCore Runtime helps protect sensitive data with complete session isolation.
- It supports all authentication methods, from OAuth tokens and API keys to IAM roles.
- Keep your AgentCore Runtime and Strands packages updated for latest features and
  security fixes
- Strands supports many different model providers.
- By default, agents use the Amazon Bedrock model provider with the Claude 4 model.
- Agents display their reasoning and responses in real-time to the console by default.
- 'Strands provides two main approaches to capture streaming events from an agent:
  async iterators and callback functions.'
- Python 3.10 or higher is required for running examples.
- 'Use meaningful node IDs: Choose descriptive names for nodes'
- 'Validate graph structure: The builder will validate entry points and warn about
  potential issues'
- 'Handle node failures: Consider how failures in one node affect the overall workflow'
- 'Use conditional edges: For dynamic workflows based on intermediate results'
- 'Consider parallelism: Independent branches can execute concurrently'
- 'Nest multi-agent patterns: Use Swarms within Graphs for complex workflows'
- 'Leverage multi-modal inputs: Use ContentBlocks for rich inputs including images'
- 'Create custom nodes for deterministic logic: Use `MultiAgentBase` for business
  rules and data processing'
- 'Use `reset_on_revisit` for iterative workflows: Enable state reset when nodes are
  revisited in cycles'
- 'Set execution limits for cyclic graphs: Use `set_max_node_executions()` and `set_execution_timeout()`
  to prevent infinite loops'
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
