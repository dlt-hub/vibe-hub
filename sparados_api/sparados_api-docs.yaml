  - Mutual TLS authentication is required for inbound API calls. Clients must provide
    a certificate signed by Sparados CA; the same certificate can be used across all
    mTLS-secured APIs. For outbound calls, the server presents its own certificate
    signed by Verestro CA, and clients should configure trust for the environment-specific
    root CA certificate.
