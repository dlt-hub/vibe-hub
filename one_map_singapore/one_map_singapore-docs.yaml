auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/:
  - From 01 October 2025, Search API access requires token-based authentication. You
    must register a token at the OneMap registration portal to use the Search API.
    The documentation does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or method
    for sending the token in requests.
- information_source; https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/authentication:
  - Authentication is performed by sending a POST request to /api/auth/post/getToken
    with email and password in the request body to obtain an access token valid for
    3 days. The token is not required for map services. Required body parameters are
    email (string, registered OneMap email) and password (string, OneMap password).
    Token expiry is provided in UNIX format and does not auto-renew; re-authentication
    is needed after expiration. Developers should securely store credentials and not
    pass authentication data in plain text.
  - Authentication uses email and password credentials sent in a JSON request body
    to POST /api/auth/post/getToken. The response returns an access_token and expiry_timestamp;
    credentials are provided via environment variables ONEMAP_EMAIL and ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD,
    with required JSON fields email and password in the request body.
- information_source; https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/docs/verifyingsearchapitoken:
  - 'API requests require an Authorization header with a valid API token. The token
    must be obtained by registering for an account. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as Authorization: <valid_api_token>. Invalid or missing tokens will return
    a 200 OK response with an error field indicating "Invalid authentication token."'
  - Authentication is required via an API token passed in the Authorization header.
    Tokens expire after 3 days and must be generated through account creation; missing
    or invalid tokens return error responses with HTTP 200 status.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/docs/verifyingsearchapitoken:
  - Pagination uses a pageNum query parameter (required, integer starting at 1) to
    request specific pages. The response includes totalNumPages and pageNum fields
    to indicate the total number of pages and current page number respectively, allowing
    clients to iterate through results by incrementing pageNum until it reaches totalNumPages.
  - 'The response objects include pagination fields: pageNum (the requested page number)
    and totalNumPages (total number of pages available). Pagination is controlled
    via the pageNum query parameter to request specific pages.'
- information_source; https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/search:
  - pageNum is an optional query parameter (integer) that specifies which page of
    search results to retrieve. The response includes totalNumPages and pageNum fields
    indicating the total number of pages and current page number; continue paginating
    by incrementing pageNum until it reaches totalNumPages.
