notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in Velosimo Admin
- Ensure HTTPS bindings and SSL certificate are configured
- The server address is the URL to your Laserfiche Server.
- The Laserfiche user that is used for the integration needs to have the expected
  permissions to upload, create, and read for any files, folders, templates and volumes
  that are used to configure the Velosimo admin.
- The Laserfiche user needs to have the expected permissions to upload, create, and
  read for any files, folders, templates and volumes.
- Set the Accela standard choice DISPLAY_RECORD_DOCUMENT, INSPECTION = NO
- The Laserfiche user permissions need to be updated to allow for upload, create,
  and read for any files, folders, templates and volumes that are being used.
- The allowed field character length in Laserfiche should be set to match the field
  length allowed in Accela.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Ensure Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x64) is installed.
- Add HTTPS bindings & confirm that a valid SSL certificate is up to date.
- For on-premise Sharepoint deployments you will need to provide firewall access to
  the Velosimo Cloud's IP addresses 54.70.20.215, 35.164.131.175, 3.222.241.24.
- Velosimo requires a named user within Accela that has Full Access to FID 0364.
- Although not required, the best practice is to create a 'SharePoint Integration'
  user.
- The Authorizing of Sharepoint should be set before authorizing the endpoints.
- Set the Accela standard choice DISPLAY_RECORD_DOCUMENTS (INSPECTION) = NO
- Please contact Velosimo support to obtain the installers
- Authorizing with Bluebeam should be completed using an Incognito Browser session.
- Each environment will have a unique URL.
- Please contact Velosimo for the unique Tenant Key and Token.
- Please contact Velosimo to confirm the unique URL values for each environment.
- This will always be https://connect.velosimo.io/ unless Velosimo provides a different
  URL.
- An administrative user with rights to create envelopes is recommended for the integration
  user.
- Velosimo configures non-Production tenants to use https://account-d.docusign.com
  and Production tenants to use https://account.docusign.com.

- Once completed, the URL will be returned to its normal use value.
- It is advisable that the Bluebeam user is not tied to an individual user, but an
  Admin user role where the email address and password don't change or expire.
