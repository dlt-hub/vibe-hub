notes:
- Alpha flags are experimental features that are in an early testing phase and is
  likely to change or be removed without prior notice.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Self-service product documentation for developers and technology professionals.
- Learn how you can use Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) to contextualize and analyze your
  technical data in the cloud and efficiently manage and use your information and
  insights.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- One template has a limit of 500 tasks.
- Templates left in Draft will remain templates and won't appear as checklists.
- Observations are information collected from field workers on malfunctioning equipment.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Cognite.
- Some API responses may include nested data structures.
- Some responses may include nested fields with null values.
- Some features are in Beta testing and should not be used in production systems.
- CDF projects running in Google Cloud Platform need to be added to an allowlist to
  support scheduling of transformations using OpenID Connect.
- Starting January 1, 2026, we are moving the Set threshold rules feature from public
  beta to private beta.
- As of early December 2025, we will no longer support AI features in Jupyter Notebook
  for generating code snippets and modifying existing code through natural language
  queries.
- Starting at the end of December 2025, we'll no longer be developing new features
  or providing support for InRobot.
- Update the Python runtime to version 3.11 or later to continue using Cognite Functions.
- Starting August 11, 2025, we'll no longer be updating and supporting the Data profiling
  functionality in Charts.
- The Power BI OData connector is deprecated in favor of the Power BI REST API connector.
- Starting September 1, 2023, we'll no longer develop new features for Cognite Remote.
- Since February 1, 2023, we've stopped developing new features for this version of
  InField.
- To load user interfaces correctly, add these URLs to your allowlist
- Multi-tenant and dedicated clusters are available.
- Cognite keeps your data private
- Cognite enables controlled access to your data
- Cognite keeps your data integrity intact
- Cognite uses your data to create an up-to-date digital representation of physical
  reality
- Cognite monitors and audits CDF and services
- The Cognite security commitment informs the design and operation of Cognite Data
  Fusion.
- Alpha flags are experimental features that are in an early testing phase and is
  likely to change or be removed without prior notice. Do not use the product or functionality
  in production systems.
- Proper planning is crucial to manage the lifecycle of the applications, data integrations,
  and other modules implemented with Cognite Data Fusion (CDF).
- To upgrade the Cognite Toolkit to the latest version, run `pip install --upgrade
  cognite-toolkit` or `poetry add cognite-toolkit@latest`.
- To upgrade to a specific version, run `pip install cognite-toolkit==0.3.0b4` or
  `poetry add cognite-toolkit@0.3.0b4`.
- Access control should be self-contained within each module.
- Changing a Cognite Data Fusion project requires elevated privileges.
- The cdf.toml file is created automatically when you run the cdf modules init command.
- The file_encoding defaults to utf-8 on Linux and MacOS, and cp1252 on Windows.
- The Cognite Toolkit can run on any CI/CD platform that can install and run a CLI
  or a Docker container.
- Plugins are only supported for Cognite Toolkit version 0.3.0 and later.
- The goal is to have a reliable, high-quality implementation in a production environment
  while supporting a fast iterative setup for a development environment.
- Typically uses Agile methodology for project delivery.
- Focus on well-defined data sets for the asset/equipment in your scope.
- Don't store client credentials or secrets in configuration files or source files.
  Instead, protect this information with GitHub secrets or Key Vaults.
- Make sure that you submit client secrets through a secret and encrypted channel.
- If the installation fails, see the troubleshooting section.
- The Cognite Toolkit comes installed with built-in modules.
- For governance of production projects, we also recommend using a CI/CD pipeline
  to deploy changes to Cognite Data Fusion.
- If the installation fails, see the troubleshooting section
- 'If you are a Windows user, you might get the following error: `ERROR: Could not
  install package due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ...`. It
  means that you don''t have Windows Long Path support enabled.'
- To upgrade the Cognite Toolkit to the latest version, run 'pip install --upgrade
  cognite-toolkit' or 'poetry add cognite-toolkit@latest'.
- To upgrade to a specific version, run 'pip install cognite-toolkit==0.3.0b4' or
  'poetry add cognite-toolkit@0.3.0b4'.
- Make sure that you update all the variables that are set to *<change_me>*. If not,
  the module won't be deployed correctly.
- The `client_credentials` flow is recommended for CI/CD pipelines.
- The `device_code` flow is recommended for local development.
- The file is created automatically when you run the `cdf modules init` command.
- Alpha features are experimental and may change or be removed in future releases.
- By default, alpha flags aren't enabled. To enable them, you must update the cdf.toml
  file.
- The Cognite Toolkit injects environment variables in the cdf deploy/clean/pull commands.
- You don't need to declare environment variables.
- The Cognite Toolkit ensures the integrity of the configuration and automates the
  deployment.
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Recommended sign-in flow for CI/CD pipelines is client_credentials.
- Do not check .env files into version control repositories.
