Based on the provided documentation for the `orb_subscriptions` API, here is a complete YAML configuration that follows the specified structure:

client:
  base_url: "https://api.withorb.com/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"
    in: "header"  # Indicates where the API key should be included

resources:
  - name: "subscriptions"
    endpoint: "/subscriptions"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      - name: "customer_id"
        required: false
        description: "Filter subscriptions by customer ID"
      - name: "status"
        required: false
        description: "Filter subscriptions by their status (e.g., active, canceled)"
    data_selector: "$.data"  # Assuming the response contains a 'data' key with the relevant information

  - name: "plans"
    endpoint: "/plans"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      - name: "active"
        required: false
