auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.supergood.ai/travelperk-api/:
  - Basic authentication is required for all API calls. The POST /authenticate endpoint
    accepts username and password (with optional mfaEmailAddress for multi-factor
    authentication) and returns an authToken. Subsequent API requests must include
    the authToken in the request body and use the Authorization header with Basic
    <Base64 encoded token> format. The POST /reauthenticate endpoint refreshes the
    token before expiry to maintain continuous access.
- information_source; https://docs.supergood.ai/navan-api/:
  - HTTP Basic authentication is required, using Base64-encoded credentials sent in
    the Authorization header. After initial login via POST /authenticate with username
    and password, an authToken is returned and must be included in subsequent API
    requests. The authToken can be refreshed via POST /reauthenticate before expiry
    to maintain continuous access.
- information_source; https://docs.supergood.ai/insync-ehr-api/:
  - Supergood API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a Base64 encoded token sent
    in the Authorization header for initial authentication. The /authenticate endpoint
    accepts username and password in the request body and returns an authToken. This
    authToken must then be included in the request body of subsequent API calls like
    /update_patient_details. The /reauthenticate endpoint allows token refresh before
    expiry to maintain continuous access.
  - Supergood authenticates to InSync through the standard login flow using POST /authenticate
    with username and password credentials. Supergood manages session tokens and automatic
    token refresh internally, abstracting the underlying bearer token mechanism with
    short validity periods that InSync requires.
- information_source; https://docs.supergood.ai/appfolio-api/:
  - Basic authentication is used for API requests via the Authorization header with
    a Base64-encoded token. Additionally, an authToken obtained from the /authenticate
    endpoint must be included in the request body for operations like creating tenant
    charges. The /authenticate endpoint accepts username, password, domain, and optional
    mfaEmailAddress to handle multi-factor authentication and return a session-valid
    auth token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.supergood.ai/neos-api/:
  - 'Use take and skip query parameters for offset-based pagination on the /sync endpoint:
    take specifies the number of records to retrieve (example 100), skip specifies
    the offset (example 100), and continue requesting with incremented skip values
    until fewer records than take are returned, indicating the final page.'
