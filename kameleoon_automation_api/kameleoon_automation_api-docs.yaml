auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/automation-api-rest/get-started/:
  - 'Bearer token authentication using JWT. Send the access_token received from the
    authorization server in the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme: "Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token}". The token is a JWT that includes expiration (exp) and
    issued-at (iat) timestamps.'
  - Kameleoon uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. After user authentication and
    consent, exchange the authorization code for an access token via POST to https://api.kameleoon.com/oauth/token
    with grant_type=authorization_code, code parameter containing the authorization
    code, redirect_uri matching your application URL, and Authorization header containing
    Basic auth with Base64-encoded client_id:client_secret credentials.
  - OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. Obtain an access token by sending a
    POST request to https://api.kameleoon.com/oauth/token with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id, and client_secret in the request body. Use the returned access_token
    as a Bearer Token in the Authorization HTTP header to access the Automation API.
    Credentials (client_id and client_secret) are obtained from the Kameleoon platform
    profile page under "See my API credentials".
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" (e.g., "Authorization: Bearer qwerty123456789"). A
    401 response indicates an invalid or missing token, and a 403 response indicates
    insufficient permissions.'
  - The Automation API uses OAuth 2.0 framework with two flows. For personal use,
    the Client Credentials Flow requires obtaining an access token by sending client_id
    and client_secret to an authorization endpoint, then using the returned access
    token as a Bearer Token in the Authorization HTTP request header. For partner
    integrations, the Authorization Code Flow is used instead.
