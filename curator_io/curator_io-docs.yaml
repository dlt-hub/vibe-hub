auth_info:
- information_source; https://curator.io/docs/api:
  - 'Basic authentication is used with an API key as the username and a blank password.
    The api_key and empty password are combined with a colon, Base64-encoded, and
    sent in the Authorization header prefixed with "Basic " (e.g., Authorization:
    Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>).'
  - 'The Curator.io API requires an API key for authentication, which can be provided
    either as a query string parameter or as HTTP Basic Auth. The API key should be
    kept secret and can be found in the Curator Dashboard.


    For query string authentication, append `?api_key=API_KEY` to the request URL.
    For HTTP Basic Auth, use the Authorization header with the API key as the username
    and an empty password, following the Basic access authentication spec where the
    credentials are base64-encoded in the format `Authorization: Basic base64(api_key:)`.'
