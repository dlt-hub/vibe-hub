auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.starburst.io/latest/starburst-rest-api.html:
  - 'Basic authentication is required using base64-encoded username:password credentials
    passed in the Authorization header. The X-Trino-Role header is optional for setting
    user roles, with sysadmin role requiring explicit specification.


    Authorization header: "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>"

    X-Trino-Role header: "X-Trino-Role: system=ROLE{rolename}" (optional, required
    only for sysadmin role)'
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: Basic authentication using username
    and password sent as an Authorization header with Base64-encoded credentials,
    or Bearer token authentication using an Authorization header with a Bearer token
    value. Authorization is controlled via the X-Trino-Role header, which must specify
    the system role in the format "system=ROLE{roleName}" to define which privileges
    apply to API requests.'
  - 'The REST API supports Basic authentication and Bearer token authentication via
    the Authorization header. For Basic auth, send the Authorization header with base64-encoded
    username:password (format: Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>).
    For Bearer tokens, use Authorization: Bearer <token>. A user with the sysadmin
    role is required to use the REST API.'
- information_source; https://docs.starburst.io/starburst-galaxy/developer-tools/api/:
  - API authentication requires a token created in the Starburst Galaxy UI under Access
    > API auth token. The token must be included in API requests and operations are
    restricted by the role assigned to that token, which determines what account-level
    and cluster-level privileges are available.
  - The Starburst Galaxy API uses authentication tokens sent over TLS/HTTPS. Each
    token is associated with a role and its privileges integrated with the access
    control system, and tokens expire after 10 minutes.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.starburst.io/448-e/api/index.html:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with a nextPageToken field returned in the
    response. Use the nextPageToken value from the current response as the cursor
    parameter in the next request to retrieve the next page of results. Stop paginating
    when nextPageToken is not returned or is null.
- information_source; https://docs.starburst.io/latest/develop/client-protocol.html:
  - If the `nextUri` field is present in the `QueryResults` JSON response from a POST
    to `/v1/statement`, there are more results to fetch. The client should loop executing
    GET requests to the `nextUri` value until `nextUri` is absent from the response,
    indicating query completion.
  - Use POST to /v1/statement with SQL query in body to initiate queries. If more
    results exist, the response includes a nextUri URL attribute; follow this nextUri
    with GET requests to retrieve subsequent result batches. Stop paginating when
    nextUri is absent from the response.
