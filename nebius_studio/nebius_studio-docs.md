In this guide, we'll set up a complete Nebius Studio data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def nebius_studio_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://studio.nebius.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "apikey",
                "apikey": dlt.secrets['api_key'],
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "models",
            "files",
            "file_contents"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='nebius_studio_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='nebius_studio_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(nebius_studio_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from nebius_studio‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Models: Retrieve information about models.
- Files: Access and manage files.
- File Contents: Retrieve contents of specific files.
- Batches: Manage and retrieve batches of tasks.
- Batch Results: Get results of processed batches.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Nebius Studio workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@nebius_studio-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Nebius Studio support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:nebius_studio duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Nebius Studio API, as specified in @nebius_studio-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "models" and "files" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in nebius_studio_pipeline.py and name the pipeline nebius_studio_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python nebius_studio_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done via API key.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.nebius.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python nebius_studio_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline nebius_studio load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset nebius_studio_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/nebius_studio.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline nebius_studio_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("nebius_studio_pipeline").dataset()
   # get models table as Pandas frame
   data.models.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure that the API key is kept secure. Pay attention to rate limits and possible data processing times, especially for batch operations.
