    method described in the Authentication section (referenced but not detailed in
    this excerpt). The bank account token must be provided as a parameter in the request,
    formatted as remessa.conta.token with a value like "api-key_i2vY-t8RcRxqdiRF_H3RVj4PYH1Ns10xf63pCmnyl5A=".
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with an API key and token. Send credentials
    in the format `api-key_<key>:token` via the `-u` flag in curl (or `Authorization:
    Basic <base64(api-key_<key>:token)>` header in other clients). The API key and
    token are provided by the service and must be included in every request.'
  - Authorization header using Basic authentication scheme. The request is made to
    /boletos/{TOKEN} endpoint where TOKEN is the boleto token obtained from a previous
