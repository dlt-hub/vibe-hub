notes:
- Each access token is valid only for 5 minutes.
- Refresh tokens are not supported for service accounts.
- Respect rate limits. Rate limits are always available in the response headers when
  you make an API request.
- If your request exceeds a certain rate limit, you will receive an HTTP 429 Too Many
  Requests response status code.
- The minimum supported version is TLS 1.2. For enhanced security and performance,
  we recommend using TLS 1.3.
- Fluentax uses Cloudflare as its CDN and security provider, so the Certificate Authority
  (CA) may be one of those listed by Cloudflare.
- If your system does not trust these CAs, please update your trust store to include
  the necessary root certificates.
- Cloudflareâ€™s IP ranges may change. We recommend subscribing to updates or monitoring
  IP list changes to avoid service disruption.
- Ensure your firewall or proxy allows outbound HTTPS traffic (port 443) to Cloudflare
  IP ranges.
- When batch processing transactional data, use the Time Series endpoints to retrieve
  exchange rates for a larger interval and cache these values on the client side for
  optimal performance. The maximum query interval is 180 days.
- Avoid repeated calls to access the same data, as this can quickly result in hitting
  an API rate limit.
- When updating your local database daily, always check for rates that may have been
  published by the bank with a delay and thus missed by your previous update.
- Do not rely solely on the daily bank update times and holidays as they are for reference
  only. Accuracy may vary by country/bank.
- Banks or tax authorities that publish monthly rates for a given month on or before
  the first day of that month may publish amendment rates later if there is a significant
  change in the exchange rates during the month. You should therefore check regularly
  for changes to monthly rates.
- The default API response format is JSON.
- The Fluentax Exchange Rates API supports several ways to set the requested response
  format.
- 'Rate limits: 20 requests per second and 1000 requests per 15 minutes.'
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your access token'
- 'HTTP 429 Too Many Requests: The Retry-After header indicates how many seconds you
  must wait before making your next request.'
- '400: Invalid bankId specified.'
- '401: Unauthorized'
- '403: Forbidden'
- '404: Not Found'
- '429: Too Many Requests'
- 400 Invalid bankId specified.
