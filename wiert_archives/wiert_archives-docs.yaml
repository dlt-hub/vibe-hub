- Sometimes Delphi cannot output the .exe file because it is locked.
- Delphi itself keeps the .exe file locked due to a bug in the debugger.
- If possible, I would also like to selectively expose (or hide) the component's TFrame
  ancestor properties and events
- Event's properties can't be hidden by this method?
- The technique resolves many design time issues that arise when using Delphi frames.
- Components on the frame are visible in the Structure Pane, which can lead to accidental
  deletion.
- The OptiPlex models series start (4 digit models) with 1 and increment upwards.
- The XPS series (4 digit models) start with a 3 and seem to be looping back round
  to 2.
- There is a bit of fan noise, although it is not bad (you can hear in the video.)
  The memory is fixed. ConnectX-3 uses a lot of power, albeit with 10GbE capabilities.
  Still, having one of these boxes my thought was constantly that it was cool. Every
  time I used it, I thought it was cool and wanted to add another node or two.
- For the firewall folks, perhaps the biggest drawback is the fans. There are two
  small fans, and this is not a passively cooled box. It also uses a lot of power
  if you do not need the 10GbE capabilities. This is also running near the limit of
  what an Intel N6005 platform provides.
- Ultimately, this is an awesome little box. In a footprint only slightly larger than
  a Raspberry Pi 4B, one gets so much more. Twice the RAM, 27.5Gbps of wired networking
  plus WiFi, onboard eMMC with M.2 expansion. A diminutive form factor should not
  lead you to underestimate the power of this machine.
- Power on the machine, restart, boot directly from network, etc, use Power Actions.
- If the PC is working Headless, no monitor plugged to the embedded graphics card,
  it is necessary to attach a Video Emulator to the video port of the system. Otherwise,
  KVM will not have access to the BIOS.
- Virtual machines for iOS and macOS
- Requires Facebook App and proper permissions to access user data.
- net::ERR_FAILED is a generic error message in Chrome indicating a failure without
  specific details.
- Given so many of my scripts now run on zsh, I added the new-line because of command
  line – Why does a cURL request return a percent sign (%) with every request in ZSH?
  – Stack Overflow. You can strip that bit.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of Twitter Developer App
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Version number only shows when signed in
- 'Migrating from Chrome to Edge was way easier than anticipated: it imported my account,

- Not all packages get updated soon after new underlying software versions arrive.
- Modifying existing packages is a lot easier than creating new ones, as often you
  have a good working example.
- The use of .nupkg or .nuspec in for package name or source is known to cause issues.
  Please use the package id from the nuspec with -s .
- No runtime virus checking built into FOSS Chocolatey. Check out Pro/Business - https://chocolatey.org/compare
- The use of .nupkg or .nuspec in for package name or source is known to cause issues.
  Please use the package id from the nuspec <id /> with -s . (for local folder where
  nupkg is found).

- API is accessible without authentication.
- No runtime virus checking built into FOSS Chocolatey.
- The source '.' evaluated to a 'normal' source type
- Debug=True
- Verbose=True
- PromptForConfirmation=True
- If a package uninstall is failing and/or you've already uninstalled the software
  outside of Chocolatey, you can attempt to run the command with `-n` to skip running
  a chocolateyUninstall script, additionally adding `-skip-autouninstaller` to skip
  an attempt to automatically remove system-installed software. Only the packaging
  files are removed and not things like software installed to Programs and Features.
- If a package is failing because it is a dependency of another package or packages,
  then you may first need to consider if it needs to be removed as packages have dependencies
  for a reason. If you decide that you still want to remove it, head into `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib`
  and find the package folder you want to be removed. Then delete the folder for the
  package. You should use this option only as a last resort.

  it in all kinds of processes.

- A socket is bidirectional, it doesn’t know or care which direction the connection
  was initially established.
- Note that if your device was infected, not all upgrades will remove the infection
  on all machines (even though it is mentioned in the FAQ below!). This is one of
  the 'underdocumenting' aspects I mentioned.
- There is no way to officially check if your device is infected.
- Always remember the splice function makes direct data paths between handles very
  cheap, so storing it as files is better.
- MyDefrag (formerly named JkDefrag) is not maintained any more but the 4.3.1 version
  in the WayBack machine still works very well as the underlying defragmentation APIs
  in Windows haven’t changed.
- Let’s remove all SuSEconfig scripts since only YaST calls SuSEconfig but other tools
  like rpm and zypper do not call it.
- This particular warning type cannot be disabled on the unit or source line level
  which means you have to disable it on the project level.
