- information_source; https://docs.cer.bo:
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials encoded in Base64 format
    via the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic CREDS", where CREDS is the
    Base64-encoded username:password pair.'

  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials via the Authorization
    header using the format "Authorization: Basic CREDS" where CREDS is the base64-encoded

  - Basic authentication is required for all endpoints. Include an Authorization header
    with the value "Basic CREDS" where CREDS is the base64-encoded username:password
    pair.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cer.bo:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, defaults to 1) and offset (query parameter)
    to control page size and starting position. The offset parameter indicates where
    to start in the result set.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (integer) and offset (integer).
    The documentation does not specify response fields indicating pagination state,
    stopping conditions, or how to construct subsequent requests.
  - 'The documentation shows pagination parameters for a supplements search endpoint:
    limit (integer, defaults to 1) and offset (integer) are query parameters used
    to control pagination. However, the documentation does not describe the response
    structure, pagination state fields, or how to determine when pagination is complete.'
  - The response includes a "has_more" boolean field indicating whether additional
    pages exist. However, the documentation does not specify request parameters (such
    as page, offset, limit, or cursor) to retrieve subsequent pages, nor does it describe
    how to construct the next request.
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: total_count (integer), has_more (boolean
    indicating if more results exist), and data (array of results). However, no request
    parameters for controlling pagination (such as limit, offset, page, or cursor)
    are documented in this endpoint specification.'
