auth_info:
- information_source; https://bitgetlimited.github.io/apidoc/en/broker/:
  - 'API authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication with three
    required headers: ACCESS-KEY (your API key), ACCESS-SIGN (HMAC-SHA256 signature
    of request content encoded in Base64), and ACCESS-PASSPHRASE (your API key passphrase).
    The signature is built by concatenating timestamp (milliseconds since epoch),
    HTTP method (uppercase), request path, query string, and request body, then encrypted
    with your secret key using HMAC-SHA256 and Base64 encoded. Include Content-Type
    header set to application/json for POST requests.'
  - API key and secret key authentication. Requests require apiKey and secretKey credentials,
    with permissions managed via perm field (e.g., read_only, contract_trade) and
    IP whitelist restrictions via ip parameter.
  - API key and secret key authentication. The apiKey (e.g., "bg_djwwwls98a1s0dLK3deq2")
    and secretKey (e.g., "Sjwwwls98a1s0dLK3deq2") are used for request signing. Permissions
    are specified via the perm field (comma-separated values like "read_only,contract_trade"),
    and IP whitelisting is enforced via the ip parameter.
  - API key authentication is required. Brokers must create an APIKey at https://www.bitget.com/account/newapi
    after login, set an IP whitelist during creation, and use the APIKey to authenticate
    requests. Sub-accounts can also have their own APIKeys created through the API
    for placing orders and controlling permissions.
  - 'API requests require four authentication headers: ACCESS-KEY (your API key),
    ACCESS-SIGN (signature), ACCESS-PASSPHRASE (passphrase), and ACCESS-TIMESTAMP
    (millisecond timestamp). The ACCESS-SIGN header must contain an HMAC-SHA256 signature
    of the request.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://bitgetlimited.github.io/apidoc/en/broker/:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageSize (default 10, max 10) and lastEndId
    (Long) to control requests. The response includes hasNextPage (boolean) and lastEndId
    (Long) fields; when hasNextPage is true, use the returned lastEndId value in the
    next request's lastEndId parameter to fetch the next page.
- information_source; https://bitgetlimited.github.io/apidoc/en/margin/:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters pageNum and pageSize (both String type,
    not required). The response returns data as an array but does not include pagination
    metadata fields like total count, next page indicators, or instructions for constructing
    subsequent requests.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with pageSize and pageId parameters. pageSize
    (optional, default 1) controls the number of results per page, and pageId (optional,
    appears to be a cursor/minId) is used to fetch subsequent pages by passing the
    minId value from the previous response.
  - Use pageSize (optional, query parameter) and pageId (optional, query parameter,
    represents minId from previous response) to paginate through isolated finance
    history. Continue requesting with the minId returned in the previous response
    until no more results are returned.
  - pageSize (optional, query parameter, controls number of results per page) and
    pageId (optional, query parameter, used for pagination via minId to retrieve subsequent
    pages). The documentation does not specify response fields indicating next page
    availability or how to determine when pagination ends.
