auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/add-vendor-product/:
  - 'Use Bearer Token authentication. Pass the token received from authentication
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}". The token must
    be obtained from the authentication endpoint before making API calls.'
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/authentication/:
  - Authentication uses a two-step bearer token flow. First, POST a JSON request with
    Username and Password fields to obtain an access_token. Then include the token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for all subsequent API
    requests. Tokens expire after 60 minutes and must be refreshed by obtaining a
    new token. The Content-Type header must be set to application/json for the authentication
    request.
  - The SellerCloud REST API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. To authenticate,
    send a POST request to [RestAPIEndpoint]/api/token with JSON content type containing
    user credentials to obtain a JWT token, which must then be included in all subsequent
    API calls. The token is digitally signed and follows RFC 7519 standard. It is
    recommended to create separate user accounts for each integration.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/create-new-customer/:
  - The API requires authentication via a token. If the user is not authenticated
    or provides an invalid token, the server returns a 401 status code. The documentation
    does not specify the exact header name, parameter name, or method for submitting
    the token.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/create-new-purchase-order/:
  - Use Bearer Token authentication. Pass the token received from token authentication
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {Token}". The token must be obtained through
    the authentication process documented in the Authentication section before making
    API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/get-all-inventory-by-view/:
  - PageNumber (required integer) and pageSize (required integer) are query parameters
    that control pagination. The response body contains an Items array with paginated
    inventory data, but no explicit pagination metadata fields like next_page, has_more,
    or total_count are documented to indicate when to stop paginating.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/get-all-orders/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters model.pageNumber (starting at 1) and model.pageSize
    (set to 50 in example) to request specific pages of results. The response is a
    GetAllResponse object containing the paginated data.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/get-all-purchase-orders/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageNumber (integer, required) and pageSize (integer,
    required) to control which page and how many results per page are returned. The
    endpoint example shows pageNumber=1&pageSize=1 format.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/get-all-vendors/:
  - pageNumber and pageSize are optional query parameters controlling pagination.
    The response includes an Items array with paginated results and a TotalResults
    field indicating the total count. Continue requesting with incremented pageNumber
    values until all results are retrieved.
- information_source; https://developer.sellercloud.com/dev-article/get-inventory-info-for-multiple-products/:
  - Use query parameters pageNumber (integer, optional) and pageSize (integer, optional)
    to control pagination. The response includes paginated inventory results based
    on these parameters.
