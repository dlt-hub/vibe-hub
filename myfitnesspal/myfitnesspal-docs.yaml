auth_info:
- information_source; https://myfitnesspalapi.com/docs/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with Authorization Code Grant flow. Clients request authorization
    at GET /oauth2/auth with query parameters including client_id, redirect_uri, and
    scope, then exchange the authorization code for an access token via POST /oauth2/token
    using form parameters. Access tokens can be refreshed using POST /oauth2/token
    with a refresh_token, and revoked via POST /oauth2/revoke. Authenticated requests
    use the access token (typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer token).
- information_source; https://myfitnesspalapi.com/docs/about/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with the Authorization Code Grant flow. Authenticate by making
    a GET request to /oauth2/auth with query parameters, then exchange the authorization
    code via POST to /oauth2/token using form parameters in the request body to obtain
    an access token. Access tokens can be refreshed by POSTing to /oauth2/token with
    refresh token form parameters, and revoked via POST to /oauth2/revoke. Scopes
    are available for granular permissions such as diary access.
- information_source; https://myfitnesspalapi.com/docs/content-type/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with Authorization Code Grant flow. Clients must request authorization
    at GET /oauth2/auth with query parameters including scopes, then exchange the
    authorization code for an access token via POST /oauth2/token using form parameters.
    Access tokens can be refreshed via POST /oauth2/token with a refresh token, and
    revoked at POST /oauth2/revoke. Authenticated requests use the access token, likely
    in an Authorization header.
- information_source; https://myfitnesspalapi.com/docs/partner-authentication/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 with Authorization Code Grant flow. Obtain an access token
    via GET /oauth2/auth (with query parameters including requested scopes) and POST
    /oauth2/token (with form body parameters for client credentials and authorization
    code). Use the access token in subsequent requests. Tokens can be refreshed via
    POST /oauth2/token with a refresh_token parameter, and revoked via POST /oauth2/revoke.

- information_source; https://myfitnesspalapi.com/docs/response-codes/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant flow for user authentication. Obtain
    an authorization code via GET /oauth2/auth with query parameters including client_id,
    redirect_uri, and scope. Exchange the code for an access token at POST /oauth2/token
    using form parameters (client_id, client_secret, code, grant_type). Refresh tokens
    via POST /oauth2/token with refresh_token and grant_type parameters. Revoke tokens
    at POST /oauth2/revoke. Access tokens are used in subsequent requests to access
    protected resources like GET /users/:userId.
