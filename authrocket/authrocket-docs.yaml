auth_info:
- information_source; https://authrocket.com/docs/api:
  - An API key is required for all AuthRocket API access. The API key must be generated
    from Realm -> Integration -> API keys and is a master key to your realm. The API
    key should only be used by trusted server processes and must be protected carefully
    as it is not safe for client apps. The specific API endpoint for your account
    is also shown next to your API key and will always end with .authrocket.com.
- information_source; https://authrocket.com/docs/api/accessing_authrocket:
  - AuthRocket API uses API key authentication via either the Authrocket-Api-Key header
    or Authorization Bearer token header. API keys are created in the management portal
    under Realm -> Integration -> API keys. Optionally, specify a default realm using
    the Authrocket-Realm header or by appending the realm ID to the Bearer token as
    a comma-separated value.
  - 'Authentication uses either an Authorization header with a bearer token or the
    custom header Authrocket-Api-Key. The Authrocket-Api-Key header accepts your Secret
    API Key (format: ks_...), which is displayed in the management portal under Realm
    -> Integration -> API keys. Alternatively, use the standard Authorization header
    with a bearer token format.'
- information_source; https://authrocket.com/docs/api/loginrocket:
  - 'A valid session ID must be provided in the request body as the `session` field
    to authenticate password update requests. The session ID follows the format `kss_*`
    (example: `kss_SAMPLE`).'
  - Session token authentication is required. The session token must be passed in
    the request body as the "session" field with a value like "kss_SAMPLE". Upon successful
    authentication, a fresh login token is returned in the response.
