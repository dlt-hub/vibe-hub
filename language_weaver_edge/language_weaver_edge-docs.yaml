auth_info:
- information_source; https://mt01.edge.languageweaver.com/docs/api/rest/index.html:
  - API requests use HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are provided via the -u
    flag with the format username:password (e.g., jsmith@example.com:u0VmztKJrwqf),
    which translates to an Authorization header with the value "Basic base64(username:password)".
  - 'Auth information found in the example request:


    Basic authentication is required using email and password credentials. Credentials
    are passed via the `-u` flag in curl, which translates to an Authorization header
    with Basic auth encoding (format: `Authorization: Basic base64(email:password)`).
    The example shows credentials as `jsmith@example.com:u0VmztKJrwqf`. Additionally,
    this endpoint is restricted to admin and super admin roles.'
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with a username and password. Credentials
    are sent in the Authorization header as base64-encoded "username:password" (e.g.,
    jsmith@example.com:u0VmztKJrwqf). Access is restricted to users with admin or
    super admin roles. The curl examples show credentials passed via the -u flag,
    which translates to the Authorization header with Basic scheme.
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with username and password credentials passed
    via the -u flag. The username is an email address (e.g., jsmith@example.com) and

    to admin and super admin roles.
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with username and password credentials. Send
    the username and password in the format `username:password` encoded in Base64
    within the Authorization header as `Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>`,
    or use the `-u` flag in curl as shown in the example with `-u jsmith@example.com:u0VmztKJrwqf`.'

  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: request parameter `page` (default 1)
    and `perPage` (default 25) in the query string; response includes `page`, `perPage`,
