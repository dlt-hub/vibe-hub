pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.saltedge.com/v6/api_reference/:
  - Pagination is used with the list endpoint. The response includes a meta object
    with next_id and next_page fields; next_page contains the full URL for fetching
    the next page of results using the from_id query parameter.
  - Pagination uses `from_id` (query parameter, optional, specifies the rule ID to
    start listing from) and `per_page` (query parameter, optional, defaults to 1,
    maximum 100) to control page size and position. The response includes `meta.next_id`
    to indicate the next page's starting ID; when `next_id` is null, there are no
    more pages.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with from_id query parameter. Response
    includes next_id and next_page fields in meta object; use next_page value for
    subsequent requests, or construct URL with from_id=next_id. Stop when next_id
    is absent.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. Request parameter from_id (query string,
    optional) specifies the cursor for fetching transactions after a given ID. Response
    includes meta.next_id (the cursor for next page) and meta.next_page (complete
    next request URL). Continue paginating by using next_id as from_id in subsequent
    requests.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with `from_id` query parameter. The response
    includes `next_page` field containing the full URL for the next page; stop paginating
    when `next_page` is absent or null.
