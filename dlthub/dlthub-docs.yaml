notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- When deploying your pipeline in a production environment, managing all configurations
  with the TOML files might not be convenient.
- dlt appends the data to the destination table by default.
- To enable deduplication, specify a primary_key or merge_key.
- When deploying your pipeline in a production environment, managing all configurations
  with files might not be convenient. In this case, we recommend you use environment
  variables to store secrets and configs instead.
- Uses GitHub API, which has a limit of ~50 calls for not authenticated users.
- Uses BearerTokenAuth for authentication.
- Repo name and access token are configurable.
- 'load the data: you''ll see the new table `deal_scores` in your destination!'
- add_limit does not limit the number of records but rather the number of yields.
- You cannot limit transformers. They should process all the data they receive fully
  to avoid inconsistencies in generated datasets.
- Async resources with a limit added may occasionally produce one item more than the
  limit on some runs. This behavior is not deterministic.
- Calling add limit on a resource will replace any previously set limits settings.
- add the filter and anonymize function to users resource and enumerate
- add_limit does not skip any items. It closes the iterator/generator that produces
  data after the limit is reached.
- For time-limited resources, the timer starts when the first item is processed.
- add_limit does not skip any items
- You cannot limit transformers
- Async resources with a limit added may occasionally produce one item more than the
  limit
- Calling add limit on a resource will replace any previously set limits settings
- For time-limited resources, the timer starts when the first item is processed
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
