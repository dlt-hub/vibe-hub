    parameter in the request URL, as shown in the example: `https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=election&api-key=yourkey`.'

    API endpoint.
- information_source; https://developer.nytimes.com/faq:
  - Your request URIs should be patterned after the examples in the API documentation,
    and you should always include your API key in a query string. This means API key
    authentication is required, passed as a query string parameter. You must register
    for an API key and agree to the Terms of Use before using any Times API.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview:
  - The Article Search API returns a maximum of 10 results per request. The meta node
    in the response contains the total number of matches, but the documentation is
    incomplete and does not specify pagination parameters such as page, offset, or
    cursor, nor does it explain how to retrieve subsequent pages.
