auth_info:
- information_source; https://esf.eurotech.com/docs/keys-and-certificates:
  - The REST APIs for Keys and Certificates require the rest.keystores permission.
    Requests must include this role-based authorization to access the keystores endpoints
    under /services/keystores/v1. The authorization is role-based and enforced per
    endpoint, with all listed endpoints requiring the keystores role.
- information_source; https://esf.eurotech.com/docs/deployment-service:
  - The ESF Deployment Agent REST APIs require role-based access control. All endpoints
    under the /deploy/v1 path require the "deploy" role to be authorized. Authentication
    is enforced at the role level, where clients must possess the deploy role to access
    GET, POST, and DELETE operations on deployment packages.
- information_source; https://esf.eurotech.com/docs/accessing-assset-data-from-everyware-cloud-4:
  - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
    via the --user parameter in HTTP requests, which translates to an Authorization
    header with Base64-encoded credentials in the format username:password.
  - Basic authentication is required. Send requests using HTTP Basic Auth with an
    ACCOUNT_NAME (username) and PASSWORD. The endpoint is https://api-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com/v2/devices/sendRequest.xml
    for sandbox or https://api.everyware-cloud.com/v2/devices/sendRequest.xml for
    production. Include TARGET_CLIENT_ID to specify the device. Credentials are passed
    via curl's standard Basic Auth mechanism (typically --user flag or Authorization
    header with base64-encoded username:password).
  - Basic authentication using username and password credentials. The ACCOUNT_NAME,
    USER_NAME, and PASSWORD variables must be provided and used for authenticating
    requests to the EDC API endpoint. These credentials are passed to authenticate
    the REST API calls for device communication.
