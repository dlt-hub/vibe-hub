auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.customs4trade.com/swagger/1.0/swagger.json:
  - CAS supports optional OAuth 2.0 client-credentials flow for notification endpoints.
    When accessTokenUrl is provided, supply clientId, clientSecret, and optionally
    scope and audience. CAS will retrieve an access token and include it in the Authorization
    header using Bearer scheme when POSTing notifications to destinationUrl. If accessTokenUrl
    is empty, POST requests are made without authorization.
  - The API requires bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    A 401 response indicates missing or invalid token, and a 403 response indicates
    insufficient permissions for the token provided.
- information_source; https://api.customs4trade.com/documentation/integration%20methods:
  - Bearer token authentication is required via JWT. Obtain the token through the
    Authentication endpoint (details at /documentation/authentication); the token
    has a 1 hour lifetime and should be sent in the Authorization header. For FTPS
    access to CAS, use username and password credentials provided by service desk
    separately for acceptance (ftps://cas-ftp-acc.customs4trade.com:990) and production
    (ftps://cas-ftp.customs4trade.com:990) environments.
- information_source; https://api.customs4trade.com/documentation/authentication:
  - CAS Service API uses OpenID Connect with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant for
    authentication. The client application must authenticate with the authorization
    server using Client Id and Client Secret to obtain an access token, then use that
    token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for API requests. The token
    response includes an expires_in field (in seconds) indicating token expiration;
    expired tokens result in 401 Unauthorized responses and require requesting a new
    token using the same Client Credentials flow.
  - 'OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow is used for API authentication. Obtain a bearer
    token by making an application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST request to https://login.customs4trade.com/oauth2/v2.0/token
    (production) or https://login-acc.customs4trade.com/oauth2/v2.0/token (acceptance)
    with parameters: grant_type=client_credentials, client_id (provided by C4T onboarding),
    client_secret (provided by C4T onboarding), and scope=https%3A%2F%2Fc4t{env}b2c.onmicrosoft.com%2F{client_id}.
    The response includes an access token and expires_in field indicating validity
    duration. Cache the token and include it as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header for all API requests. Refresh the token before expiry or when receiving
    a 401 response. Decode the JWT or call v1/authorizationStatus to verify token
    details including tenant ID, source system reference, and assigned scopes.'
