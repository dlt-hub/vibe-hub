pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/cloudfront/2020-05-31/openapi.json:
  - Pagination uses IsTruncated flag in response to indicate if more results exist.
    Use the Marker request parameter in follow-up requests to retrieve additional
    items when IsTruncated is true.
  - Pagination uses optional NextMarker parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve
    the next page of distribution IDs. The response includes NextMarker field indicating
    the marker value for the next page when results exceed the maximum number of items
    per request.
  - Use Marker query parameter (optional) to specify where to start results; set it
    to the NextMarker value from the previous response to get the next page. Response
    includes IsTruncated (boolean indicating if more results exist) and NextMarker
    (value to use in next request). MaxItems query parameter controls page size.
  - Use the Marker query parameter to paginate through results; if NextMarker is present
    in the response, pass its value as the Marker parameter in the next request to
    continue listing. MaxItems controls the maximum number of elements returned per
    request.
