notes:
- You can authenticate by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY env variable or passing api_key
  below.
- You can authenticate by setting the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env variable or passing api_key
  below.
- If you're on the Databricks platform, authentication is automatic via their SDK.
- Maintaining conversation history is a fundamental feature.
- Uses `dspy.History` to manage conversation history.
- 'Important: When invoking a custom DSPy module, you should use the module instance
  directly (which calls the __call__ method internally), rather than calling the forward()
  method explicitly.'
- The dataset consists of StackExchange-based questions and their correct answers.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses dspy for module execution
- Evaluation metrics reported with average score
- The prompt optimization process is systematic and may overfit your training set.
- This model is tiny, so it can complain fairly often.
- Use the search function to define tools for the ReAct agent.
- Uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model for authentication — requires OPENAI_API_KEY
- Uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model for entity extraction.
- MLflow automatically save the frozen environment metadata along with the program
  to ensure reproducibility.
- With MLflow, you can track the program's performance and cost along with the program
  itself.
- The tutorial uses a small local LM, Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
- The larger LM, GPT-4o, is used as a teacher model.
- The tutorial includes steps for installing dependencies and downloading data.
- Uses a custom server to retrieve Wikipedia abstracts for context.
- Requires API key from FAL.
- All interactions will be structured in a specific format.
- The inspect_history function retrieves the last n interactions.
- Using `dspy.Audio` in signatures allows passing in audio directly to the model.
- Uses an embedding-based similarity metric for audio evaluation.
- Human feedback or perceptual metrics are more suitable for evaluating audio quality.
- Uses OPENAI_API_KEY for authentication
- Uses GPT-4o as the teacher model for strong reasoning.
- This tutorial requires a local GPU at the moment for inference.
- 'Recommended: Set up MLflow Tracing to understand what''s happening under the hood.'
- fine-tuning is an experimental feature, so we set a flag to enable it
- You can share the program and results with your team members by sharing the MLflow
  experiment.
- Uses MLflow for tracking experiments and visualization.
- To set up MLflow, install MLflow and start the UI in a separate terminal.
- Evaluation results can be tracked and visualized using MLflow.
- Setup MLflow Tracing for learning what's happening under the hood
- Connect the notebook to MLflow at http://localhost:5000
- Out of the box, on this task, 4o is decent (58% success rate) while 4o-mini struggles
  (15% success rate).
- Set up MLflow Autologging to understand what's happening under the hood.
- Uses a math contest-style problem approach for optimization.
- Feedback is provided for incorrect answers.
- No authentication required.
- Unnecessary coordinate bashes in clean geometric configurations; prefer power of
  a point, radical axis, and symmetry/reflective arguments.
- Guessing parameters numerically; instead, derive exact values via structure.
- Mishandling expression forms (e.g., incorrectly “forcing” m/√n by ad hoc rationalization).
  Output the exact requested form.
- Uses REST API for data retrieval.
- Uses MLflow for tracking optimization and results
- GEPA is a reflective prompt optimizer.
- The final score is based on performance across three distinct tasks.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in ProCare Facility
  Solutions
- Uses OpenAI API for model interactions
- Uses a privacy-preserving prompt generation approach for sensitive information.
- MLflow integration for tracking and visualization.
- Uses Arbor RL server for optimization
- This feature is new and extremely EXPERIMENTAL. Unlike almost everything else in
  DSPy, it's currently in pure proof of concept and development mode.
- Training on 6 GPUs.
- To save the state of a program, use the save method and set save_program=False.
- We recommend saving the state to a JSON file because it is safer and readable.
- Supports saving the whole program, including architecture and state from dspy>=2.6.0.
- As of dspy<3.0.0, we don't guarantee the backward compatibility of the saved program.
- Starting from dspy>=3.0.0, we will guarantee the backward compatibility of the saved
  program in major releases.
- By default, both in-memory and on-disk caching are automatically enabled in DSPy.
- You can manage the capacity of the in-memory and on-disk caches using the configure_cache
  utility.
- No sign up for services or an API key is required for MLflow tracing.
- It is highly recommended to use SQL store when using MLflow tracing
- If traces aren't appearing, ensure log_traces_from_compile=True
- For large datasets, consider setting log_traces_from_compile=False to avoid memory
  issues
- For large datasets, consider setting `log_traces_from_compile=False` to avoid memory
  issues
- MLflow's built-in integration for DSPy provides traceability and debuggability
- DSPy's token streaming feature works with any module in your pipeline, not just
  the final output.
- Streaming requires async context.
- StreamListener automatically closes after a session unless allow_reuse=True.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Streaming is implemented in a sidecar fashion.
- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of GitHub access token
- Requires GitHub access token for API calls.
- Uses OpenAI API key for authentication.
- Uses OpenAI API key for authentication
- Ensure that Python 3.9+ is installed
- Add more email types and refine classification (newsletter, promotional, etc.)
- Add integration with email providers (Gmail API, Outlook, IMAP)
- Experiment with different LLMs and optimization strategies
- Add multilingual support for international email processing
- Optimization for increasing the performance of your program
- Uses AI for dynamic scene generation and dialogue.
- Game state heavily relies on player choices and actions.
- MIPROv2 is the latest extension of MIPRO which includes updates such as improvements
  to instruction proposal and more efficient search with minibatching.
- Can choose between light, medium, and heavy optimization runs
- 'Detailed documentation can be found here: ../api/optimizers/COPRO/'
