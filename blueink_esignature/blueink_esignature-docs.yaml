auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.blueink.com/docs/esignature-api/authentication/:
  - 'All requests to the Blueink API require an Authorization header with the format
    "Token <your-api-key>", where your-api-key is obtained from the Blueink Dashboard.
    Include the header as Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY in each request.'
- information_source; https://developer.blueink.com/docs/esignature-api/webhook/:
  - 'Webhook requests use HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. The webhook secret (found
    on the API screen) is used to compute an HMAC signature over a message constructed
    as "v0:{x-blueink-request-timestamp}:{json_request_body}", then compared against
    the signature sent in the request header.


    To verify: obtain the webhook secret from your API screen, extract the x-blueink-request-timestamp
    header value, compute HMAC-SHA256 using UTF-8 encoding with the secret as the
    key and the constructed message as input, and compare the resulting hexdigest
    (prefixed with "v0=") against the incoming webhook signature using constant-time
    comparison.'
