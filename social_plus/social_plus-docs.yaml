auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.docs.social.plus/:
  - All APIs except some authentication APIs require an access token for authentication
    and authorization. The access token is used to identify whether the request is
    in Admin or User context, with User context requests limited to data accessible
    by that user. Specific details on token format, header name, acquisition method,
    and scope requirements are not provided in this documentation excerpt.
