notes:
- Always use HTTPS when calling authenticated endpoints to encrypt credentials in
  transit.
- Rate limit restricts the number of requests a client can make within a given time
  period (for example, 100 requests per minute).
- When the limit is reached, the API temporarily rejects new requests and usually
  returns an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code.
- Pagination is used when there is more data to load than the data source provides
  in a single load.
- Finding endpoint is just like finding ports in network pentest.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- There is no way of programmatically discovering REST services as they do not have
  a standard registry service.
- RESTful services are designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
errors:
- '429 Too Many Requests: Please wait 60 seconds before sending new requests.'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
