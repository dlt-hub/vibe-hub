auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.breeze.pm/api:
  - API authentication uses an api_token query parameter. Pass api_token=YOUR_TOKEN
    with every request. For multi-team users, also include team_id as a query parameter
    or add the HTTP header X-TEAM-ID to specify which team the request applies to.
  - 'Breeze API supports two authentication methods: HTTP Basic auth using username
    and password (curl -u username:password), or token-based auth using an API token.
    The token can be sent as the username in Basic auth format (curl -u api_token:)
    or as a query parameter named api_token. For users in multiple teams, the team
    ID must be included in every request.'
