pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.irisid.com:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, max 1000) and offset (query
    parameter, optional) to control page size and starting position. Response structure
    is not explicitly detailed for pagination fields like next or has_more.
  - 'The userlist endpoint supports offset-limit pagination via query parameters:
    limit (results per page) and offset (starting position). The response is a JSON
    array of user objects with no explicit pagination metadata fields or next/previous
    indicators provided.'
  - 'The userlist endpoint supports pagination via query parameters: limit (set to
    0 in the example) and offset (set to 1 in the example). The response is a JSON
    array of user objects. No explicit next/previous fields or continuation tokens
    are described in the documentation provided.'
  - Use query parameters offset (starting position) and limit (max results per request,
    capped at 1000) to paginate through user lists. No response fields indicate next
    page or total count; construct subsequent requests by incrementing offset by the
    number of results returned until fewer results than limit are received.
  - limit and offset query parameters control pagination. limit specifies the maximum
    number of results per request with a maximum of 1000, and offset specifies the
    starting position. No pagination response fields are documented.
