notes:
- If your Zeek installation is owned by 'root' and you intend to run zkg as a different
  user, you can use zkg's user mode (zkg --user).
- Creating this config file in user mode (zkg --user autoconfig) ensures that all
  state and content directories reside within $HOME/.zkg.
- The default package source is normally https://github.com/zeek/packages
- The default package template is normally https://github.com/zeek/package-template
- Uses zkg for package management — requires setup of git repository and zkg meta
  file
- The build_command field is an arbitrary shell command that the package manager will
  run before installing the package.
- The user_vars field is used to solicit feedback from users for use during execution
  of the build_command field.
- The test_command field is an arbitrary shell command that the package manager will
  run when a user either manually runs the test command or before the package is installed
  or upgraded.
- The config_files field may be used to specify a list of files that users are intended
  to directly modify after installation.
- The depends field may be used to specify a list of dependencies that the package
  requires.
- The external_depends field follows the same format as the depends field, but the
  dependency names refer to external/third-party software packages.
- The suggests field follows the same format as the depends field, but it's used for
  specifying optional packages that users may want to additionally install.
- The magic index file name of zkg.index is available since zkg v2.0.
- The old index file name of bro-pkg.index is also still supported.
- Uses a state directory and a manifest file within it to keep track of package sources,
  installed packages and their statuses.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Defines user variables for Zeek packages
- If your Zeek installation is owned by 'root' and you intend to run zkg as a different
  user, you have two options.
- The primary install prefix for binary packages is /opt/zeek.
