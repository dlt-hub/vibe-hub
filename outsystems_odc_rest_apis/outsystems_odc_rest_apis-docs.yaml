auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/integration_with_external_systems/rest/consume_rest_apis/
  : - OutSystems REST APIs support built-in Basic authentication and OAuth 2.0 client
      credentials flow. For token-based authentication, use OAuth 2.0 client credentials
      flow or add authorization info to request headers via OnBeforeRequest callback.
      Client certificate authentication requires OnBeforeRequestAdvanced callback
      with .NET extension code.
- ? information_source; https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/integration_with_external_systems/rest/expose_rest_apis/add_custom_authentication_to_an_exposed_rest_api/
  : - 'Custom authentication uses two required HTTP headers: X-Contacts-AppId for
      the application identifier and X-Contacts-Key for the secret API key. Both values
      must be included in each request and matched against records in an APIKey entity
      database table to authenticate successfully.'
    - Custom authentication using HTTP headers X-Contacts-AppId and X-Contacts-Key.
      Extract both header values via GetRequestHeader server actions, validate them
      using the ValidateAPIKey server action with ApplicationId and ApplicationKey
      parameters, and raise an InvalidAPIKey user exception if validation fails.
    - To implement custom authentication for an exposed REST API in OutSystems, set
      the Authentication property to Custom, which creates an OnAuthentication callback
      action that executes before each incoming request. Within this callback, use
      HTTPRequestHandler API actions GetRequestHeader, GetFormValue, or GetRequestContent
      to extract credentials from the HTTP request (headers, URL parameters, or body).
      Design your authentication logic in the OnAuthentication action to validate
      the received credentials against your security requirements, such as verifying
      an App ID and API Key pair.
- information_source; https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/reference/outsystems_apis/performancemonitoring_api/:
  - Authentication can be basic authentication using LifeTime user credentials, or
    service account tokens as described in LifeTime API documentation. The user must
    have Open and Debug Applications permissions in the environment to retrieve request
    events for applications.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/reference/outsystems_apis/performancemonitoring_api/:
  - NumberOfResults is an optional query parameter (int32) that limits the maximum
    events returned, with a default upper limit of 15000. The response includes a
    ResultsTruncated boolean field; when true, retrieve the next set by sending a
    new request with StartInstant set to the Instant of the most recent RequestEvent
    from the previous response.
- ? information_source; https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/odc_rest_apis/page_through_lists_of_resources/
  : - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
      the number of results per page (set to 2 in the example), and offset specifies
      the starting position (set to 0 for the first page). Results are returned in
      a results array within the response.
    - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes a page
      object with count, limit, offset, nextPageOffset, totalResults, and totalPages
      fields. To retrieve the next page, increment the offset parameter by the limit
      value, or use the nextPageOffset value from the response, until offset reaches
      or exceeds totalResults.
