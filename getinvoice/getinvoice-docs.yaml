auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.getinvoice.co/docs/auth:
  - Bearer token authentication is used. Send the current access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" to the GET endpoint https://api.getinvoice.co/v1/token/refresh
    to refresh and receive a new access token; the previous token is then invalidated.
    The response includes a new refresh_token, token type as bearer, and expiry timestamp.
  - The API uses a two-step authentication flow. First, call the authenticate endpoint
    with an api_key query parameter to receive a JWT bearer token with an expiry timestamp.
    Then, include this token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" for subsequent
    requests. When the token expires, use the refresh_token from the authentication
    response to obtain a new token, which invalidates the previous one.
  - The Invoice API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. You must first
    obtain an access token by making a POST request to https://api.getinvoice.co/v1/authenticate
    with your api_key in the JSON request body. The returned token value must then
    be included as an Authorization header in all subsequent API requests.
