notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests made over plain HTTP will fail.
- Each API key comprises the client_id and client_secret.
- You need different API keys for each environment.
- To implement the highest-quality solution together quickly and efficiently, carefully
  identify all your requirements and describe them as specifically as possible. This
  helps us offer the best advice and accurately develop any special requests.
- 'Each API key comprises the following: client_id, client_secret'
- Clients generally don’t know that we record video because this helps us detect fraud.
- Physical Proof of Address is mandatory in France.
- Use Qualified Electronic Signature in your Identity Verification solution to offer
  compliant onboarding flows for specific markets, e.g. France, Portugal, and Germany.
- No limit on the number of documents that can be signed in a single signature flow.
- Fourthline performs a one-time screening to check whether the client is contained
  in any public sanctions, PEP watchlist or in adverse media articles.
- Fourthline’s AML products ensure that clients are not sanctioned, PEPs, known fraudsters,
  or in adverse media articles.
- Fourthline supports two NFC flows depending on whether the client's eID requires
  a CAN.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Biometric Authentication is supported in both Workflows v1 and Workflows v2.
- Metrics are optional. By default, we report using Categories and Priorities, but
  metrics can be contracted if required.
- Reports don’t contain sensitive data, only identifiers.
- Fourthline uses cloud computing solutions provided primarily by Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) as the core building block of our platform.
- Fourthline performs thorough due diligence assessments of any potential third-party
  services and systems.
- Re-verifying clients significantly reduces your risk of non-compliance with evolving
  regulations.
- Metrics are optional and can be contracted if required.
- Sensitive data should only be shared via APIs.
- Personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) are not supported.

- The API supports various integration options.
- Each verification has one status at a time.
- Filters can be used to narrow the list of verifications.
- Users must be invited to access Hub.
- Pending users can sign in but need roles assigned to access functionality.
- Data is transferred between Cordova and our plugin API via JSON formatted Strings,
  both as input configuration options and payload responses.
- Fourthline's scanners are designed to be implemented and tested on a real mobile
  device. Launching them on the iOS simulator throws a scanner error.

- The components can send document/selfie photos to our backend as soon as they are
  captured.
- To test the workflow offline, use .mock. To test networking, use .sandbox or .production.
- All attributes for selfie and liveness are optional.
- Choose .mock to test Workflow offline or .sandbox/.production to test networking
- You need your tenantId provided by Fourthline.
- Only use TestMe in debug mode because it doesn't return an outcome or CDD Report
  and isn't configurable.
- Treat the token as a password. Don't add it to your version control system.
- Use .mock for offline testing or .sandbox/.production for networking
- Ensure a valid WorkflowSession is started before using the Biometrics Component

  including color themes.
- We encourage integration teams to verify that customizations remain aligned with
  accessibility standards.
- Fourthline usually supports a minimum age of 18 years, but for Web SDK integrations
  you can configure this to 16 years.
- This endpoint works for Identity Verification workflows only, not for workflows
  that also include Qualified Electronic Signature and/or Bank Account Verification.
- You can set 1 risk code or 1 or more status codes, but not both a risk code and
  status code(s) in 1 request.
- Fourthline ensures photos are taken during the workflow, in compliance with art.
