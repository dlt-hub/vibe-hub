notes:
- Include your API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
- Include your API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header to authorize
  your requests.
- The X-API-Key header was previously used for authentication and is still supported,
  but considered deprecated.
- Keep your API key secret!
- If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can reissue it by clicking
  on the 'Change API key' button.
- Creating multiple free accounts to bypass usage limits is strictly prohibited under
  the Netlas License Agreement.
- Not available on the free plan
- Limited availability on the free plan
- Domains will be resolved at the moment of the scan, so you don't need to include
  A-records in the list of targets.
- Netlas scanner is not a specialized web application scanner. While it supports HTTP
  scanning, it only scans the main pages and follows 301 and 302 redirects.
- Netlas uses its own scanning technology, purpose-built for safe, high-speed, and
  large-scale internet scanning.
- IPv6 is not supported for scanning.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
