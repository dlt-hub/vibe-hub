notes:
- Framework is open-source and based on Angular.
- Applications are Single-Page Applications (SPA).
- The Sinequa API must necessarily be served over HTTPS for authentication methods
  to work.
- When Sinequa handles authentication, it emits a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is stored
  in a cookie.
- The JWT is sent with every HTTP(S) request via the sinequa-web-token cookie.
- When the token expires, Sinequa returns 401 errors (Unauthorized).
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Some browsers may behave differently with Windows Single Sign-On
- Upgrading your Sinequa environment will override the web.config file. So it’s highly
  recommended to backup this file in the folder and replace the web.config file with
  the backup after an upgrade.
- By default, only administrators are allowed to use these plugins, but it is possible
  to change this rule.
errors:
- 'HTTP 413: Request Entity Too Large'
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your configuration or token expiration.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Sinequa returns 401 errors when the token expires'
