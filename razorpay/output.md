In this guide, we'll set up a complete Razorpay data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def razorpay_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.razorpay.com/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "basic",
                "client_id": access_key,
                "client_secret": secret_key
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "payments",
            "refunds",
            "invoices"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='razorpay_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='razorpay_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(razorpay_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from razorpay‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Payments: Create, retrieve, and list payments.\n- Refunds: Issue refunds for transactions.\n- Invoices: Generate and manage invoices.\n- Accounts: Manage merchant accounts, including current accounts.\n- Payouts: Process and manage payouts.\n- Payroll: Handle payroll and compliances.\n- Payment Gateway: Interface for payment transactions.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Razorpay workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@razorpay-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Razorpay support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:razorpay duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@razorpay-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Razorpay API, as specified in @razorpay-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "payments" and "refunds" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in razorpay_pipeline.py and name the pipeline razorpay_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python razorpay_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Uses Basic authentication for API access, with client ID and client secret. OAuth2 is used for secure, token-based authentication involving refresh tokens.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.razorpay.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python razorpay_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline razorpay load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset razorpay_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/razorpay.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline razorpay_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("razorpay_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "payments" table as Pandas frame
   data."payments".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure strict confidentiality of the API key and secret. Must use TLS version 1.2 or higher for payout processing. Test mode utilizes a dummy balance, not real money. Rate limits are enforced on API calls, and DNS caching must be handled correctly when not using Razorpay SDKs. Ensure compliance with rate limits and use retry mechanisms for handling HTTP status code 429.
