auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/doc-REST_API_Guide/:
  - Any user with an oVirt engine account must authenticate using OAuth 2.0 or basic
    authentication. For OAuth, send a POST request to /ovirt-engine/sso/oauth/token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded containing grant_type set
    to password, scope set to ovirt-app-api, username, and password parameters. The
    response provides an access token for subsequent API requests.
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" in all requests to the API.'
  - 'Authorization is performed using bearer tokens. Include the token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Bearer <token>". The token value must be
    placed after "Bearer " in the header.'
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are sent using the `--user` parameter
    in curl format as `username:password`, which translates to the HTTP `Authorization`
    header with Basic auth encoding. The username format is `admin@internal` for the
    admin user.
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are sent via the --user parameter
    (username:password format) in curl, which translates to an Authorization header
    with base64-encoded credentials in the format "Basic base64(username:password)".
    Additionally, a Version header set to "4" is required in requests. SSL certificate
    verification is needed (--cacert parameter points to /etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/doc-REST_API_Guide/:
  - Pagination is controlled via a page parameter in the search query string. To paginate
    results, include page 1, page 2, etc. in the search parameter value (for example
    search=sortby%20time%20asc%20page%201). Increment the page number to retrieve
    subsequent pages; the API does not provide explicit response fields indicating
    when pagination ends.
  - Sets the maximum number of QoS descriptors to return. If not specified all the
    descriptors are returned. Use the max query parameter to limit the number of results,
    with no default specified, allowing retrieval of all descriptors when omitted.
  - Sets the maximum number of errata to return via the max query parameter (optional
    integer); if not specified, all errata are returned.
  - Sets the maximum number of hooks to return via the max parameter. If not specified,
    all hooks are returned.
  - Sets the maximum number of permits to return using the max query parameter (integer,
    optional, no default specified). If max is not specified, all permits are returned.
