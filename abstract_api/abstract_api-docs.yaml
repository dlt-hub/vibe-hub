  - Your API key is your unique authentication credential and must be appended as
    a query parameter named api_key to the base URL https://scrape.abstractapi.com/v1/.
    Each Abstract API has a unique api_key, so the Web Scraping API key is distinct
    from keys for other APIs like Email Validation.
