notes:
- OAuth-based token authentication allows secure access to Swagâ€™s APIs.
- Uses user credentials for authentication.
- Session must be maintained for each request.
- This integration guide enables external AI systems to seamlessly interact with Snappy's
  gift campaign management through our MCP server, providing a standardized and secure
  way to automate personalized gifting workflows.
- 'API Key must be included in every request in the format: X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
- Requests without these parameters will use the default values.
- Each gift is associated with a unique key, ensuring that duplicate submissions are
  automatically detected and rejected.
- If a duplicate key is detected, the API will return an appropriate error response
  with errorCode=41008.
