pagination_info:
- information_source; https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/http_api_reference:
  - Page and page_size are query parameters controlling pagination. Page defaults
    to 1, page_size defaults to 30. The response contains a data array with datasets.
    Use the page parameter to navigate through results, incrementing it to retrieve
    subsequent pages until no more data is returned.
  - Pagination uses query parameters `page` (integer, default 1) and `page_size` (integer,
    default 30) to request specific pages of chat assistants. The response structure
    for pagination state is not documented in this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, defaults to 1) and page_size (integer,
    defaults to 30) to control which page and how many documents per page are returned.
    No explicit response fields indicate next page or end of pagination are documented.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, defaults to 1) and page_size (integer,
    defaults to 30). The response structure for indicating total pages or next page
    information is not documented in this excerpt.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (defaults to 1)
    and page_size (defaults to 30). The response is an array in the data field; continue
    requesting with incremented page values until fewer results than page_size are
    returned or the array is empty.
