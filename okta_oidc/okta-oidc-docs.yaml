notes:
- Okta is a standards-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server and a certified OpenID
  Connect provider.
- If you don't specify a method when registering your client, the default method is
  client_secret_basic.
- 'Okta has two types of authorization servers: the org authorization server and the
  custom authorization server.'
- Requests to the `/authorize` endpoint should redirect the browser (user agent) to
  the endpoint.
- The `/bc/authorize` endpoint requires client authentication.
- The `/challenge` endpoint requires client authentication.
- The `/introspect` endpoint requires client authentication.
- Requests to the `/authorize` endpoint should redirect the browser (user agent) to
  the endpoint. You can't use AJAX with this endpoint.
- The `/bc/authorize` endpoint requires client authentication. The method is configured
  per client app.
- The `/challenge` endpoint requires client authentication. The method is configured
  per client app.
- Some browsers have begun blocking third-party cookies by default, disrupting Okta
  functionality in certain flows.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- A custom error page only appears when an app connects to Okta by using your custom
  domain.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Okta
- CORS requires specific origins to be permitted in the Admin Console.
- If you try to clone a credential that the target app instance already has, the API
  responds with a 400 error code.
- SAML responses are signed and contain the profile attributes of the person who requested
  access to the app.
- Uses API token for authentication.
- Ensure to replace placeholders in endpoints with actual values.
- After you update the key credential, your users can't access the SAML app or the
  Identity Provider until you upload the new certificate to the Service Provider (SP).
- Sharing certificates isn't a recommended security practice.
- Some orgs support DNSSEC and need to point their custom domain to example.okta-dnssec.com,
  instead of example.okta.com.
- You must provide a subdomain for customizing the Okta org domain. Okta doesn't support
  the use of a root domain name.
- If you configure any SAML or WS-Fed integrated apps in your org, review the setup
  instructions for SAML SSO or WS-Fed SSO.
- If you sign a user in with your new custom domain, they may need to sign in more
  than once.
- When you implement a custom domain, users aren't automatically rerouted from the
  original URL to the new custom URL.
- It can take up to 15 minutes for the domain and certificate to be ready and testable.
- It may take up to 48 hours for these changes to propagate.
- Warning notices may appear on your custom domain until propagation is finished.
- Email templates must be under 64 KB.
- Okta supports only inline CSS.
- The Subject can't exceed 128 characters.
- Some orgs support DNSSEC and need to point their custom domain to 'example.okta-dnssec.com',
  instead of 'example.okta.com'.
- You can only enable the code editor if you configure a custom domain.
- It may take up to 48 hours for changes to propagate.
- Gen3 of the Sign-In Widget doesn’t use fixed CSS class names.
- If you still want to use afterRender, consider using the MutationObserver function.
- If you use the embedded Okta Sign-In Widget for authentication, don't use `{emailAuthenticationLink}`
  as the required validation field.
- Users with free.fr email addresses may not receive emails delivered by Okta. This
  is due to free.fr enforcing non-standard email processing.
- Cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in
  our systems.
- Some parts of the site will not work if cookies are blocked.
- This document is for the second generation (Gen2) of the Okta Sign-In Widget.
- Users with free.fr email addresses may not receive emails delivered by Okta.
- JWTs allow claims, such as user data, to be represented in a secure manner, helping
  to ensure trust and security in your app.
- To create a client app and specify either the client_secret_jwt or private_key_jwt
  authentication method, see the parameter details of the Apps API reference section.
- Access tokens often have limited lifetimes.
- The app can refresh expired tokens by using a refresh token.
- Access tokens often have limited lifetimes. If you allow access tokens to expire,
  their usefulness is limited in the event an attacker discovers them.
- Your app can refresh expired tokens by using a refresh token.
- New apps are automatically assigned the default app sign-in policy, which requires
  a user to verify their identity with two factors.
- Use the issuer URI of your default custom authorization server.
- Ensure that you have all the Identity Engine Java SDK software requirements.
- Okta Integrator Free Plan org is used for testing and development.
- Supports password-optional user sign-up flow
- The email property represents the account's username and primary email address.
- To test the sign-in integration, you must use a user with an enrolled email authenticator.
- The email authenticator supports user verification by one-time passcode (OTP) and
  by magic links.
- Uses Okta Java management SDK to update user's profile information.
- Uses the Okta Java management SDK to update the user's profile information.
- Best practices for password optional
- User emails can change, get lost, become compromised, and may not be accessible
  during authentication.
- Requires setup of an Okta application for authentication
- Requires setup of connected app in Okta
- Some API responses may include null values in certain fields
- Passwords are vulnerable to theft and phishing.
- Allow users to choose other authenticators by replacing password-only experiences.
- 'Valid OAuth Redirect URIs for your Okta org is in the format: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback.'
- Password recovery flow requires email factor.
- Ensure Okta org is configured for multifactor use.
- The password recovery use case requires the password and email factors.
- Email is the only recovery factor available.
- A request context for the browser client is required when a server-side web app
  uses an embedded SDK as a proxy.
- Email and Phone authenticators are set as optional enrollment factors.
- In proxy model architectures, where a server-side app using the embedded SDK is
  used as a proxy between client apps and Okta servers, a request context for the
  client apps is required.
- The account's username is also its primary email address.
- A request context for the browser client is required when a server-side web app
  uses an embedded SDK as a proxy between itself and Okta.
- This sign-in use case requires the password and phone factors.
- 'The Java SDK requires the following phone number format: `{+}{country-code}{area-code}{number}`.
  For example, `+15556667777`.'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of Okta application
- In proxy model architectures, security enforcement based on the client request context's
  IP address and user agent isn't available until a solution is found.
- No additional configuration changes needed to implement this use case.
- Requires setup of connected app in okta
- To learn about a sign-in use case where the password is optional, see the Sign in
  with email only guide.
- In Okta Sign-In Widget version 7+, Identity Engine is enabled by default.
- If you’re using an earlier version than 7, you must explicitly enable Identity Engine
  features.
- There are no additional configuration changes needed to implement this use case.
- Ensure you have the correct permissions set in Okta to use the API
- Rate limits apply on API calls
- 'The Valid OAuth Redirect URIs value for your Okta org is in the format: `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`.'
- For the Java SDK embedded authentication sample app, the Sign-in redirect URIs is
  set to `http://localhost:8080`.
- Identity Engine is enabled by default in version 7+.
- This guide uses the Email Verification Experience setting to configure magic links.
- Using ${resetPasswordLink} sends the user to an Okta-hosted page to sign in.
- The recovery token is included in the URL returned by the /forgot_password API.
- Passwords are a security vulnerability because they can be easily stolen and are
  prone to phishing attacks.
- Ensure that the Sign-In Redirect URI that you set in your app integration and your
  app's config file are the same.
- Okta Verify is unavailable for server-side applications using the embedded SDK until
  Okta finds a solution.
- 'The Valid OAuth Redirect URIs value for your Okta org is in the format: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback'
- For the Java SDK embedded authentication sample app, the Sign-in redirect URIs is
  set to http://localhost:8080
- Setup can be as easy as a snapshot of a QR Code.
- Google Authenticator is resistant to SIM swap attacks.
- To disable magic link functionality, remove links from the email templates.
- WebAuthn requires enabling in the Okta org and configuring app sign-in policies.
- To complete the password reset, use your own infrastructure to send the password
  recovery email.
- Depending on the org configuration, the AuthenticationResponse may contain authenticationStatus
  of SUCCESS along with token information, or another status to indicate that there
  are further remediation steps to complete.
- Email Magic Links are only supported in OIDC-based app integrations.
- Users must be in the same browser on the same device to use magic links.
- Google Authenticator is an authenticator app developed by Google that's used to
  verify the identity of a user.
- Okta sends users an email based on the Forgot Password template when they start
  a password recovery.
- WebAuthn requires a compatible authenticator.
- Ensure that your app and custom authorization server are configured for Identity
  Engine.
- Depending on the org configuration, the AuthenticationResponse returned by IDXAuthenticationWrapper.verifyWebAuthn()
  may contain authenticationStatus of SUCCESS along with token information, or another
  status to indicate that there are further remediation steps to complete.
- The upgrade process is non-disruptive and iterative.
- MFA challenges can differ based on user, group, context, and available factors.
- Uses Email Magic Links for password recovery
- Email templates use Velocity Templating Language (VTL)
- Requires setup of Identity Engine SDK methods for MFA and password recovery.
- The app receives the response and the user can sign in.
- If you have a new Okta Integrator Free Plan org and plan to use the default custom
  authorization server, check that it has an access policy.
- Consider access tokens as opaque strings because their content is subject to change
  at any time.
- The Identity Engine SDK provides greater flexibility for user access experiences.
- If you call the direct /api/v1/policies API to manage or update MFA enrollment policies,
  you need to update these calls to use Identity Engine policies.
- The Client Credentials flow is intended for server-side client apps with no end
  user.
- Make sure to create custom scopes for the authorization server.
- The password recovery flow requires SMS as a factor.
- If you have a new Okta Integrator Free Plan org and plan to use the default custom
  authorization server, check that it has an access policy. Add an access policy if
  it's not there.
- Use the Okta JWT Verifier for Java on a resource server that runs an API Service.
  Don't use the verifier as part of a mobile app. Minor network delays could trigger
  the one second default timeout.
- The default authorization server ID is 'default'.
- When EL group functions are used for app assignments, the profile attributes of
  the app user aren't updated or reapplied when the user's group membership changes.
- This function was previously only available for a limited set of features on Okta
  Identity Engine, but has been expanded to all features that allow Expression Language.
- These expressions don't work for SAML 2.0 apps.
- Default authorization server ID is 'default'.
- Use an absolute path for the audience property.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- SLO supports web and single-page (SPA) OIDC apps and OAuth 2.0 client apps.
- Okta requires the `email` attribute for a user.
- Automatic linking can be enabled for IdP accounts.
