auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.dilisense.com:
  - API key authentication is required. Include your private API key in the request
    header (exact header name not specified in this excerpt, but a 401 error is returned
    if invalid). The API key must be securely stored and is tracked per key to monitor
    usage.
  - The API key must be enabled for access to this endpoint. You will receive default
    sources plus additional sources for which your API key was enabled. The API key
    determines which sources are available in the response.
- information_source; https://developers.dilisense.com/:
  - The API key must be enabled for access to default and additional sources. You
    will receive default sources and any additional sources your API key was enabled
    for; non-default sources require a separate request to be enabled. The API key
    appears to be passed as part of the request (likely as a query parameter or header),
    though the exact mechanism is not explicitly stated in this documentation excerpt.
  - The API uses a private API key that must be included in the request header. If
    the API key is not valid, the API returns a 401 HTTP error code. The key is provided
    by the service and must be securely stored. The exact header name for passing
    the API key is not specified in this documentation excerpt.
- information_source; https://developers.dilisense.com/products/adverse-media-screening-api:
  - All API calls to dilisense require authentication via API key passed in the x-api-key
    header. The private API key is provided by dilisense and must be securely stored;
    invalid keys return a 401 HTTP error code.
