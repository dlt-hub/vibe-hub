notes:
- Uscreen is deprecating API v1 on September 30, 2025.
- Create separate business accounts for Samsung services.
- Agree to terms and privacy policies for each account.
- Using an Organizational Developer Account ensures faster approvals and smoother
  app launches.
- Registered businesses unlock the benefits of Organizational accounts.
- Uscreen API access is available to customers on our UscreenPlus.
- Webhook creation and deletion via API is not currently supported.
- This SSO method only works in web browsers and will not work for native mobile or
  TV apps.
- Due to additional steps required in this setup process, if you are using an organizational
  GSuite/Google Workspace account to sign up for the developer account, please make
  sure that you are the owner or a Super Admin of the account before proceeding.
- Applying for a Google Individual account comes with increased and time-consuming
  app requirements.
- This is the most reliable method for Uscreen sites, though it requires renewal approximately
  every six months (180 days).
- You cannot modify the default robots.txt file.
- Server-level access for HTTP headers is not available.
- There is no built-in option to password-protect pages.
- There is no global setting to disable indexing for all videos at once.
- This is a bit of a workaround and requires some ongoing legwork on your end to make
  it run smoothly.
- Shopify is also a 'Premium' Zapier integration, so you'll need to be on the Starter
  Plan($19.99/month) at minimum to set this up.
- Device Sessions Limits is in beta and has limited capabilities.
- Requires a Uscreen Plus plan.
- WooCommerce will handle the recurring subscription charges, while Uscreen will provide
  access to the content.
- There currently is no way for the initial subscription payment to happen in WooCommerce
  and then Uscreen to continue charging the customer without the customer having to
  enter their payment details a second time in Uscreen, which would be pretty confusing
  for them.
- You'll need an additional add-on for WooCommerce called WooCommerce Subscriptions.
- This allows you to offer products with recurring charges such as subscriptions.
- Make sure you title the product in WooCommerce the same as you do in Uscreen.
- Setting the field 'Charge Subscriptions Outside Of Uscreen' to True will let the
  Uscreen billing system know that you'll be handling subscription billing through
  Shopify rather than Uscreen.
- Zapier integration is available for Uscreen Plus plans.
- Code Snippets are available for Uscreen Plus plans.
- Zapier integration is available for the App Essentials or Plus plan.
- Uscreen strongly encourages you to have a business account.
- Business accounts are required to receive automatic update to your Apple apps when
  we release new updates.
- Individual accounts can not receive automatic updates.
- Today, Uscreen allows individual accounts, but we will stop supporting them in 2024.
- This will not work to re-assign current access for existing subscribers or those
  who have access to the same bundle you plan to assign in bulk.
- If you bulk assign a subscription, there will be no payment information for these
  users as they did not opt-in through the checkout with a form of payment.
- It's advisable to ensure the subscription plan you assign has a sufficient free
  trial duration.
- If any of these users you bulk assign Subscription access to has had a free trial
  before, they will not be given the free trial again.
- Some debit cards can be processed, while others cannot.
- Visa prepaid debit cards must be specifically set up to allow international transactions.

  accounts in a different country.
- Apple requires an annual fee to maintain your developer account and keep your apps
  live in the store.
