auth_info:
- information_source; https://vrchat.community/reference:
  - 'Authorization uses Basic authentication with a token sent via the Authorization
    header. The format is "Authorization: Basic <token>" where the token is base64-encoded
    credentials. Cookies are automatically managed by the API library but do not persist
    across restarts; username/password authentication is supported but will quickly
    hit rate limits in production due to undisclosed simultaneous session limits.'
  - authToken is a string field present in the response that serves as the authentication
    token for the user. This token should be included in subsequent API requests,
    typically in the Authorization header or as a query parameter, to authenticate
    the user's identity and maintain their session.
- information_source; https://vrchat.community/reference/get-files:
  - Auth Token via Cookie is required. The token must be sent in the cookie header
    to authenticate requests to this endpoint.
  - The API requires authentication via a cookie named `auth`. Include the `auth`
    cookie in request headers to authenticate API calls.
- information_source; https://vrchat.community/reference/start-file-data-upload:
  - Authentication is performed via a cookie. The auth cookie must be sent with requests;
    the cookie name is "auth" and it should contain a valid authentication token obtained
    after logging in to the VRChat API.
