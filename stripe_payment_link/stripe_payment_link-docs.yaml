auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/retrieve:
  - Stripe API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer sk_test_..." or "Bearer sk_live_..." depending on your environment.
    The Stripe-Version header specifies the API version being used.
  - Stripe API uses Bearer token authentication. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer sk_test_..." or "Bearer sk_live_..." depending on your environment.
    Include the Stripe-Version header to specify the API version.
  - Stripe API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a secret API key. The secret key
    (prefixed with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`) is passed as the username in the Authorization
    header using the format `username:password` where the password is empty, or equivalently
    via the `-u` flag in curl as `key:`. The key should be kept secure and used only
    on the server side.
  - Stripe API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the API key as the username and
    an empty password. Send your secret key (e.g., sk_test_...) in the Authorization
    header using the format username:password, where username is the API key and password
    is empty. Alternatively, pass the API key with a colon appended as the -u parameter
    in curl requests.
  - 'Stripe API v2 uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key as a Bearer
    token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer sk_test_...` (your secret
    key).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/retrieve:
  - Use the limit query parameter to set page size and the page query parameter to
    specify the requested page. The response includes next_page_url and previous_page_url
    fields to navigate between pages.
- information_source; https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event_destinations/update:
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (page size) and page (requested page as
    string). Response includes next_page_url and previous_page_url fields to navigate
    pages; stop when these fields are null.
  - The API uses a simple pagination scheme with a has_more boolean field in the response
    indicating whether additional elements exist. Paginated results are returned in
    a data array, and pagination is controlled by request parameters (specific parameter
    names not detailed in this excerpt).
  - 'The response contains pagination fields: next_page_url and previous_page_url
    are both null, indicating no additional pages exist for this list endpoint. Use
    next_page_url value to request the next page if it is not null.'
  - Use cursor-based pagination with the `next_page` field from the response. Pass
    `next_page` value to subsequent requests to fetch the next page. Stop when `has_more`
    is false. Optional `total_count` field available via expansion shows total matching
    objects up to 10,000.
