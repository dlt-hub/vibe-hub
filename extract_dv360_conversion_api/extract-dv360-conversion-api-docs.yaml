notes:
- Ensure that your email and profile picture are visible, and verify that the destination
  status is Connected.
- The destination is configured but hasn't been authenticated yet. Complete the authentication
  process to start syncing data.
- The destination login details are valid, but no connections are actively syncing
  data. Set up data connections to start syncing data.
- This destination is successfully connected and actively receiving data through at
  least one connection.
- The destination's login credentials need to be refreshed to continue syncing data.
- The destination is facing errors that prevent any connected pipelines from functioning.
  Check the error logs for details.
- Each stream (or table) within a connection has a cursor, which acts as a checkpoint
  indicating where the next data run should begin.
- Different sources apply different limitations on backfills.
- Some destination fields require hashed values (e.g., email addresses for audience
  matching). If your fields are not already hashed, you can choose to have Extract
  perform the hashing for you—this is the recommended option.
- Failing to provide proper diff information may result in sync errors or rejected
  records by the destination.
- The destination is configured but hasn't been authenticated yet.
- Complete the authentication process to start syncing data.

- 'Your source dataset must be compatible with the parameter requirements of Meta''s
  Conversions API, as outlined here: [Meta Conversions API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/parameters/customer-information-parameters).
  This includes adhering to the expected formats and field types. If your data does
  not meet these requirements, the sync may fail.'
