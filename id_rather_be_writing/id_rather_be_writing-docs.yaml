auth_info:
- information_source; https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/:
  - OpenWeatherMap API uses an API key passed as a query parameter named appid. The
    API key is obtained by signing up at https://openweathermap.org/, and OpenWeatherMap
    sends it via email or it can be retrieved from the API Keys tab in the dashboard
    after logging in. Include the key in requests as appid=YOUR_API_KEY in the query
    string.
- information_source; https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_more_about_authorization.html:
  - 'API keys are typically included in the request URL or as a header string to authenticate
    and identify the caller. Basic Auth involves encoding a username:password pair
    in Base64 and sending it in the Authorization header (e.g., Authorization: Basic
    bG9sOnNlY3VyZQ==). APIs may provide separate public and private keys, where the
    public key is included in requests and the private key is used only for server-to-server
    communication. Basic Auth should always use HTTPS to encrypt credentials in transit.'
  - 'OAuth 2.0 authentication flow: the consumer application sends application key
    and secret to an authentication server, receives an access token in a redirect
    response, then includes that access token in the Authorization header of API requests
    using the format "Bearer {access_token}". The access token defines user permissions
    and typically expires after a period of time, requiring re-authentication.'
