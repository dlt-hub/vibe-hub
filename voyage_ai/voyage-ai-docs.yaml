notes:
- API key should be stored securely and not shared.
- Voyage reranker endpoint is now generally available.
- Voyage AI provides API endpoints for embedding and reranking models.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Use environment variable VOYAGE_API_KEY for API key.
- Voyage has a limit on the context length and the number of total tokens in each
  request.
- API key must be provided for authentication.
- Uses API key for authentication
- Uses API Key for authentication
- Maximum of 1,000 inputs allowed in a single request.
- Total tokens across all inputs must not exceed 120K.
- Total chunks across all inputs must not exceed 16K.
- Voyage multimodal embedding models can directly vectorize inputs containing interleaved
  text + images.
- Voyage reranker receives as input a query and a list of candidate documents.
- Uses API key — requires environment variable VOYAGE_API_KEY.
- Quantized embeddings have lower precision, reducing storage costs.
- Rate limits promote equitable access to the API for all users.
- Rate limits enable Voyage AI to effectively manage the workload on its infrastructure.
- They act as a safeguard against potential abuse or misuse of the API.
- Rate limits are imposed on the number of times and tokens a user can access the
  API services within a specified period of time.
- Rate limits are set at the organization and project levels.
- Rate limits are set at 2000 RPM (requests per minute) and 8M TPM (tokens per minute)
  for various models.
- Rate limits are set at the organization and project level.
- Exceeding rate limits results in a 429 error.
- Voyage model pricing is usage-based, with charges billed to the account linked to
  the API key used for access.
- An organization is the top-level administrative entity in a Voyage account, with
  each account starting with a default organization.
- Billing, budget limits, and data controls are managed at the organization level.
- Invited users will receive an email to accept the invitation.
- Voyage AI will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Voyage AI API SaaS
  Services available on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis.
- Model package deployment requires specific SageMaker instances (e.g., ml.g5.xlarge).
- 'Model packages offer several benefits to customers: Data flow and access control,
  Reliability and compliance backed by AWS, Billing and payment through AWS.'
- Data never leaves the customers' virtual network, comprehensively addressing data
  privacy risks associated with third-party or multi-tenant serving.
- Only Azure will be the customer's sub-processor, and customers will inherit all
  Azure's reliability and compliance guarantees.
- Ensure you are within the same virtual network to access the API endpoints.
- SSH access is configured with a public key.
- If you would like to add a new library here or need assistance with the integration,
  please contact the Voyage team
- Community SDKs are available in various languages.
- Currently we offer fine-tuned embeddings through subscription.
- The first 200 million tokens are free for every account, and subsequent usage is
  priced on a per-token basis.
- Uses API key for authentication — requires account setup.
- First 200 million tokens are free for every account, and subsequent usage is priced
  on a per-token basis.
