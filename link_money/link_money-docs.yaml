auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.link.money/quickstart/:
  - Link Money recommends that client ID and client secret must not be exposed outside
    of your backend. All authorization tokens should be confined to your backend.
    Your session key endpoint must be authenticated and only allow obtaining a session
    key for a specific customer, with your frontend passing whatever authentication
    mechanism you use to verify the request.
- information_source; https://developer.link.money/api/authentication/gettoken:
  - 'The API uses OAuth2 client credentials grant type for authentication. To obtain
    an access token, send a POST request to /v1/tokens with form-encoded parameters:
    client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "client_credentials", and an optional
    scope parameter (values: "Link-Core" or "Link-Payment"). The response includes
    an access_token field (type Bearer), expires_in (seconds), token_type, and scope.
    Use the returned access_token in subsequent API calls as a Bearer token.'
