    HTTP authentication is supported for the url parameter via username and password
    settings in the request body for accessing protected pages during conversion.
  - Authentication requires an API key and username sent as HTTP headers. Include
    the X-API-Key header with your API key (a UUID format string) and the X-API-Username
    header with your username. Both credentials are available from your profile page
    and dashboard after account signup.
