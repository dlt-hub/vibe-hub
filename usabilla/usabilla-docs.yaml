auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.usabilla.com:
  - API key and secret authentication. The client requires two credentials passed
    as environment variables USABILLA_API_KEY and USABILLA_API_SECRET, which are then
    used to initialize the Usabilla client. These credentials must be provided when
    creating a new Usabilla instance.
  - Access Key and Secret Key are required for authentication. Pass the Access Key
    as the first argument and Secret Key as the second argument when initializing
    the Usabilla client. These credentials are used to authenticate API requests to
    retrieve In-Page widgets and feedback data.
  - The API uses ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY for authentication. These credentials are
    passed to the client constructor during initialization. The exact mechanism for
    sending these credentials (headers, query parameters, or request body) is not
    specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - The API uses Access Key and Secret Key for authentication. These credentials are
    passed as constructor arguments to the Usabilla client library (argv[0] for Access
    Key, argv[1] for Secret Key). The exact mechanism for sending these credentials
    in HTTP requests is not fully detailed in the provided excerpt.
  - The API uses HMAC-SHA256 request signing. Requests require a canonical request
    format (HTTP method, path, headers, payload hash) hashed with SHA-256, then a
    string-to-sign is created combining the algorithm name, request date, credential
    scope, and hashed canonical request digest, which is then signed with a secret
    key using HMAC-SHA256. The resulting signature is sent in an Authorization header
    following AWS Signature Version 4 format.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.usabilla.com:
  - 'Pagination uses optional URL query parameters: limit (Integer) to control the
    number of items returned per request, and since (Timestamp, UTC) to retrieve feedback
    items created after a specified time, allowing incremental data retrieval.'
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (integer) controls the number
    of results per request, and since (UTC timestamp) filters results to those after
    a specified time, allowing incremental data retrieval.'
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (integer, non-mandatory) controls
    the number of results per request, and since (integer, non-mandatory) filters
    results from a specific point. The response is returned in JSON format with individual
    result objects.'
  - 'The `GET /live/apps` endpoint supports pagination through optional URL query
    parameters: limit (Integer) to control the number of results, and since (Timestamp)
    to filter results by UTC timestamp. The response returns an array of App Form
    objects with id, date, name, and status fields, but no explicit pagination markers
    like next_page or has_more are documented.'
  - The endpoint `GET /live/websites/campaign/:id/results` supports pagination through
    a `limit` parameter (Integer, optional, URL query). The `since` parameter (Timestamp,
    optional) allows filtering results from a specific UTC timestamp. No response
    pagination fields, cursor mechanism, or stopping condition are documented.
