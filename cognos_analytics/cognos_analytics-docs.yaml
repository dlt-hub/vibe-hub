auth_info:
- information_source; https://community.ibm.com/community/user/discussion/cognos-analytics-api-authentication-with-api-key:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send two parameters: CAMNamespace (the namespace
    value) and CAMAPILoginKey (the API key value). These are typically sent as query
    parameters or in the request headers, depending on the endpoint implementation.'
  - API key authentication requires first obtaining an XSRF token via a GET request
    to /api/v1/session without a payload, capturing the returned cookie, then including
    that cookie in subsequent requests including the actual authentication PUT request.
  - Authentication with Cognos Analytics REST API requires first obtaining an XSRF
    token via a GET request to /api/v1/session, then capturing and including the resulting
    cookie in subsequent authentication requests. The actual authentication uses a
    PUT request with a JSON body containing credentials object with parameters array
    specifying CAMNamespace and CAMAPILoginKey, and the XSRF cookie must be included
    in all requests.
  - 'Cognos Analytics 11.2.4 REST API uses API key authentication via a JSON request
    body. Send a POST request with a credentials object containing two parameters:
    CAMNamespace (the namespace value) and CAMAPILoginKey (your API key value), structured
    as name-value pairs in a parameters array.'
  - 'Cognos Analytics API authentication requires a two-step process: first, send
    a GET request to /api/v1/session to retrieve an XSRF token from the response cookie,
    then include that cookie in a PUT request with a JSON body containing credentials
    (namespace and CAMAPILoginKey). The credentials object must have a "parameters"
    array with name-value pairs for "CAMNamespace" and "CAMAPILoginKey", and the XSRF
    token cookie must be sent on all subsequent requests.'
