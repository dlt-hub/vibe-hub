auth_info:
- information_source; https://gofile.io/api:
  - All API requests require an API token for authentication. Include the token in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN". Retrieve your API token from
    your profile page at gofile.io/myprofile. Most endpoints require a premium account;
    only basic operations like uploading, creating folders, and removing content are
    available with free accounts.
  - Basic authentication can be configured for direct links by providing an array
    of username:password combinations in the auth parameter of POST or PUT requests
    to the directlinks endpoints. The auth parameter accepts an array of strings formatted
    as "username:password" pairs, for example ["user1:pass1", "user2:pass2"]. This
    restricts access to the direct link, requiring clients to provide valid credentials
    from the configured list.
  - The Gofile API uses token-based authentication. An API token is required to authenticate
    requests and identify your account; the token is used to retrieve your account
    ID via the `/accounts/getid` endpoint, and tokens can be reset via the `/accounts/{accountId}/resettoken`
    endpoint which sends a new token to your registered email. The documentation does
    not explicitly specify the exact header name or parameter name where the token
    should be sent, so the precise transmission method cannot be determined from this
    excerpt.
