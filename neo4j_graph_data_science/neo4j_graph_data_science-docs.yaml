auth_info:
- information_source; https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication/:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to obtain access tokens. Send a POST request
    to https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token with grant_type=client_credentials in the
    body and provide client_id and client_secret via HTTP Basic Authentication. The
    response contains an access_token with a 3600 second expiration that should be
    cached and reused for subsequent API calls.
  - The Aura API uses Bearer Token authentication. To obtain a token, send a POST
    request to https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token with HTTP Basic Authentication using
    client_id and client_secret as username and password, grant_type set to client_credentials
    in the request body, and Content-Type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    Include the returned access_token in the Authorization header as Bearer <access_token>
    for all API requests.
- information_source; https://neo4j.com/docs/http-api/current/authentication-authorization/:
  - Basic authentication and Bearer token authentication are both supported. For Basic
    auth, combine username and password with a colon, base64-encode the result, and
    send it in the Authorization header as "Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>". For
    Bearer token auth, base64-encode the token and send it in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <base64-encoded-token>". The Authorization header is required; missing
    it returns a 401 Forbidden error.
  - 'The API requires HTTP Basic Authentication via the Authorization header. Send
    credentials as base64-encoded username:password in the format "Authorization:
    Basic <base64(username:password)>". If the header is missing or credentials are
    invalid, the server returns 401 Unauthorized.'
- information_source; https://neo4j.com/docs/query-api/current/authentication-authorization/:
  - 'Basic authentication uses the Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    Basic" followed by base64-encoded credentials in the form "username:password".
    Bearer authentication uses "Authorization: Bearer" followed by base64-encoded
    token. Both schemes send credentials via the Authorization header, and omitting
    it results in a 401 Forbidden response.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://neo4j.com/docs/rest-docs/current/:
  - Pagination is available via the paged_traverse endpoint which accepts optional
    query parameters pageSize and leaseTime to control page size and lease duration
    for traversal results.
  - The documentation mentions a `paged_traverse` endpoint with query parameters `pageSize`
    and `leaseTime` for paginated traversal results, but does not provide explicit
    details about pagination mechanics such as response fields, stopping conditions,
    or how to navigate between pages.
  - The response includes a `paged_traverse` URL template with query parameters `pageSize`
    and `leaseTime` for paginating traverse results, but no explicit pagination response
    fields or stopping conditions are documented in this excerpt.
