auth_info:
- information_source; https://computop-docs.redocly.app/index.html.md:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Generate a short-lived JWT by sending your
    API key to the POST /authorization/oauth/token endpoint, then use the returned
    token in subsequent API requests.
  - The Computop Paygate API supports two authentication methods. Basic Authentication
    uses your Merchant ID as username and API Key as password, combined as MerchantID:APIKey,
    Base64-encoded, and sent in the Authorization header with the Basic prefix. OAuth
    2.0 uses a short-lived JWT obtained from the /authorization/oauth/token endpoint
    and sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
