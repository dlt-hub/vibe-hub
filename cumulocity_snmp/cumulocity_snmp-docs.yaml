auth_info:
- information_source; https://cumulocity.com/api/core/:
  - Authentication can be performed using Basic auth or OAI-Secure (OAuth2) or SSO.
    The DELETE operation requires the ROLE_ALARM_ADMIN role. A 401 response indicates
    missing or invalid authentication credentials, and a 403 response indicates insufficient
    authorization for the operation.
  - 'Authentication information is missing or invalid. The API requires Basic authentication.
    Credentials must be sent in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme (base64-encoded
    username:password). Additionally, specific roles are required: ROLE_TENANT_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN,
    ROLE_TENANT_ADMIN, or ROLE_TENANT_MANAGEMENT_READ.'
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth. Credentials must be sent in the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Basic <AUTHORIZATION>", where <AUTHORIZATION>
    is the base64-encoded username:password. The API also enforces role-based access
    control, requiring one of: ROLE_INVENTORY_ADMIN, ROLE_MANAGED_OBJECT_ADMIN, owner
    of the source, or MANAGE_OBJECT_ADMIN permission on the source.'
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: Basic <AUTHORIZATION>" where <AUTHORIZATION> is the base64-encoded
    username:password. Access requires appropriate roles such as ROLE_USER_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN
    or ROLE_USER_MANAGEMENT_CREATE with parent user relationship.'
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    with the format "Authorization: Basic <AUTHORIZATION>", where <AUTHORIZATION>
    is the base64-encoded username:password. A 401 response indicates missing or invalid
    authentication; a 403 response indicates insufficient permissions/roles.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://cumulocity.com/api/core/:
  - 'Collection resources support paging via query parameters: currentPage (defaults
    to 1, starts at 1) and pageSize (defaults to 5, max 2000). Optional withTotalElements
    and withTotalPages parameters return total counts in the statistics object. Responses
    include next and prev links for navigating pages.'
  - Collection resources use `next` and `prev` links in responses to navigate pages.
    Request pagination via query parameters `pageSize` and `currentPage`. Response
    includes `statistics` object with `totalPages`, `pageSize`, `currentPage`, and
    `totalElements`. Optionally add `withTotalPages=true` and `withTotalElements=true`
    query parameters to include total counts.
  - Pagination uses currentPage (integer, >= 1, default 1) and pageSize (integer,
    1-2000 range) query parameters. Set withTotalPages to true to receive total page
    count in response; set withTotalElements to true to receive total element count.
    Increment currentPage to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses currentPage (integer, >= 1, default 1) and pageSize (integer,
    range 1-2000) as query parameters. Response includes withTotalElements and withTotalPages
    boolean flags to include total element count and total page count in the response.
  - Pagination uses currentPage (integer, >= 1, default 1) and pageSize (integer,
    range 1-2000) query parameters. The withTotalPages boolean parameter (default
    false) controls whether total page count is included in the response. Use currentPage
    to navigate through pages sequentially.
