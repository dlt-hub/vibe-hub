  - 'Authentication to the AIRA API is performed via HTTP Bearer Auth. Provide your
    API key as the bearer token in the Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". The API key is obtained from the AIRA Dashboard and determines
    whether requests operate in test mode or live mode. All requests must use HTTPS;
    HTTP calls and unauthenticated requests will fail.'
  - The AIRA API uses bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" with each request. Obtain your API key by contacting
    the sales team. A 401 Unauthorized response indicates no valid API key was provided.
