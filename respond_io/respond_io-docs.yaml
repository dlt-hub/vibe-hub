auth_info:
- information_source; https://learn.integray.app/connectoracademy/connectors/AdvancedRestAPI/4.7/:
  - 'OAuth2 authorization is supported. Send credentials via the Authorization header
    using the Bearer token scheme. Obtain tokens through the standard OAuth2 flow
    with client_id and client_secret, then include the token in requests as Authorization:
    Bearer <token>.'
  - REST services support multiple authentication methods including OAuth2, Token-based
    auth, and NTLM. The Authorization Method configuration parameter allows you to
    select from None, Basic (username and password), or other supported schemes. Credentials
    and tokens are passed according to the selected auth method, typically in HTTP
    headers or as query parameters depending on the scheme chosen.
  - 'The system supports multiple authentication methods: NTLM authentication using
    a domain parameter and ticket endpoint, OAuth2 token-based authentication with
    configurable token endpoint, expiration time in minutes, custom request headers,
    and request body parameters. All credentials and endpoints support dynamic placeholder
    substitution using input data references like ${input.ObjectID}.'
