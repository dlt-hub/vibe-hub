auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.peachbitcoin.com/:
  - Authentication uses public key cryptography with message signing. Send a POST
    request to /v1/user/auth/ with publicKey, message (formatted as "Peach Registration
    ${CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}"), and signature (ECDSA signature of SHA256-hashed message).
    The response contains an accessToken and expiry timestamp that should be used
    for subsequent authenticated requests.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}" for all authenticated requests to the API.
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer {token}" when making requests to the API.
  - 'Authorization uses a Bearer token sent in the Authorization header. The token
    is a UUID string that must be included as ''Authorization: Bearer <token>'' in
    request headers for authenticated endpoints.'
  - Private data requires an auth token acquired by presenting a public key (user
    id) and a message with an associated signature. Public market data endpoints do
    not require authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.peachbitcoin.com/:
  - Pagination is implemented using query parameters `page` (page number, string,
    optional) and `size` (page size, string, optional). No response fields indicating
    pagination state or navigation are described.
  - Query parameters page (starting at 0) and size (number of results per page) control
    pagination. The response includes an offers array. Continue paginating by incrementing
    the page parameter until fewer results than size are returned or the offers array
    is empty.
  - The endpoint uses a page-based pagination scheme with a query parameter `page`
    (optional, number type) where each page contains 21 messages. The response is
    an array of message objects; construct subsequent requests by incrementing the
    page parameter value.
