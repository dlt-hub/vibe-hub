auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.six-dochub.com/api/rest/documentation:
  - The API uses a security scheme called "api-protection" that must be included in
    requests. To obtain authorization, POST credentials (username and password in
    a JSON body) to the /api/rest/v1/authentication/authorization-tokens endpoint
    to receive an authorization token, which should then be included in subsequent
    API requests via the security scheme.
  - The API uses an API key-based security scheme named "api-protection". Clients
    must include this credential when making requests to protected endpoints, though
    the exact header name and transmission method are not specified in this documentation
    excerpt.
  - api-protection security scheme is required for these endpoints. Send credentials
    according to the api-protection definition in the security schemes section of
    the OpenAPI spec (not fully shown in this excerpt).
