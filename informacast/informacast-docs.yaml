auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.singlewire.com/s/article/InformaCast-Scenarios-API-Integration-Setup:
  - Authentication is required to send Scenarios through the InformaCast API using
    one of two methods. Option 1 uses OAuth2 Applications following the OAuth2 industry
    standard, with details available in the Fusion User Guide and sample apps on GitHub.
    Option 2 uses Service Accounts which pass a static bearer token in the HTTP request
    header instead of leveraging the OAuth2 flow, though this is only recommended
    for internal organizational use. Further configuration details for Security Groups
    are referenced but not provided in this excerpt.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <your-informacast-security-token>". The token must be included
    in every HTTP request to the API endpoint.
  - 'Service Accounts authenticate by passing an access token in the HTTP request
    header. OAuth2 Applications allow end-user-initiated requests through your application.
    Service Account tokens expire after one year with a 30-day renewal warning.


    For Service Account method: include the security token (generated via the Tokens
    area) in the HTTP request header. The exact header name and format are not fully
    specified in this excerpt, but the cURL example indicates header-based token passing.
    Tokens must be rotated annually. OAuth2 Application authentication details require
    referencing the sample apps at https://github.com/singlewire/oauth2-public-examples.'
