auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hydrolix.io/docs/create-a-project-table-with-api-v2:
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests.'
- information_source; https://docs.hydrolix.io/docs/intro-config-api:
  - Users authenticate to the Config API using the same authentication mechanisms
    supported for all APIs in the cluster. Auth tokens are acquired via the login
    API endpoint and returned as bearer tokens valid for 24 hours. Send the token
    in the Authorization header as a bearer token for subsequent API calls. Environment
    variables HDX_HOSTNAME, HDX_USER, and HDX_PASSWORD are used to obtain the token,
    and the resulting token is stored in HDX_TOKEN.
- information_source; https://docs.hydrolix.io/docs/user-authentication:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Extract the access_token from the auth
    response and present it in the HTTP Authorization header as "Bearer <TOKEN>".
    The token must include the "Bearer" prefix; omitting it will cause authentication
    to fail.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hydrolix.io/docs/intro-config-api:
  - The API uses two pagination schemes. Page number pagination for unbounded resources
    uses query parameters page (default 1) and page_size (default 100, max 1000),
    returning results array with count, current, num_pages, next, and previous fields.
    Cursor pagination for catalog endpoints uses page_size (default 1000, max 10000)
    and cursor query parameters, where cursor is omitted in the first request and
    set to the next or previous value from responses to navigate.
