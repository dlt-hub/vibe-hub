  - An access token issued per device in Device Management, or an API key, WebApp
    token, or OAuth token with "device control" permission, must be sent in the access_token
    request header. Before a token is issued, the API can be accessed without authentication.
  - An access token issued per device in Device Management, or an API key, WebApp
    token, or OAuth token with "device control" permission. The token should be sent
    as an Authorization header in the request, though the exact header format is not
    explicitly specified in this documentation snippet.
- information_source; https://docs.obniz.com/reference/cloud/cloudapi:
  - 'A token must be included in the authorization request header using the Bearer
    scheme format. There are two token types: WebApp tokens for application-level
    access and OAuth tokens for user-level access. The header format is authorization:
    Bearer oauth_xxxxxxx where oauth_xxxxxxx is replaced with the actual token value.'
  - The obniz cloud API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the
    Authorization header as `Bearer ${token}` when making requests to the GraphQL
    endpoint at https://api.obniz.com/v1/graphql. The token must be obtained separately
    and passed in the request headers.
- information_source; https://docs.obniz.com/reference/cloud/repository/api:
  - Authentication uses an access token passed as a cookie named access_token. For
    file uploads, the access_token cookie is required; for downloads, it is optional.
    Invalid or missing tokens result in a 403 error.
