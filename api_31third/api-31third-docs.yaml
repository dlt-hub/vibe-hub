notes:
- Data from both endpoints can be used for the SELL and BUY side, however if you also
  want to show the current balances of a wallet you should go with the second endpoint.
- Should be used for the BUY side.
- Max price impact for the swap is set to 10000 basis points by default.
- Uses API key for authentication â€” request via dev@31third.com
- Sell tokens are passed with amounts, buy tokens are passed as percentage allocation.
- 'Chain ID as hex string. (e.g.: 0x1 for Ethereum mainnet)'
- Request via dev@31third.com for API key
- API key is optional and should be requested via dev@31third.com
- Quotes should be refreshed more often, a good starting point would be 20 or 30 seconds.
- Currently we consider rebalancings to be valid for 5 minutes however quotes should
  be refreshed more often. A good starting point would be 20 or 30 seconds.
- BatchTrade contract enables executing multiple token interactions in one transaction.
- If execution of an external trade fails, the smart contract recognizes this by getting
  an error or if the minToReceive amount is not reached.
