pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.eventmobi.com/latest/index.html:
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, I can identify pagination information
    in the response structure.


    Use limit and page query parameters to paginate results. The response meta.pagination
    object contains limit (50 default), page (current page number), page_items_count
    (items in current page), total_items_count (493 total items), and sort field.
    Construct next request by incrementing the page parameter until page_items_count
    is less than limit or page times limit exceeds total_items_count.'
  - 'Pagination information is present in the response example. The API uses limit-offset
    pagination with the following parameters in the response: limit (set to 50), page
    (current page number, set to 10), page_items_count (43 items on current page),
    total_items_count (493 total items), and sort field. To paginate, increment the
    page parameter in subsequent requests until page_items_count is less than limit
    or page reaches the final page calculated from total_items_count divided by limit.'
  - Pagination uses limit (default 50), page (current page number), page_items_count
    (items in current page), and total_items_count (total results). The sort parameter
    indicates current sort order. Use page parameter to navigate through results.
  - Pagination uses limit (default 50), page (integer), page_items_count (items on
    current page), total_items_count (total items), and sort (sort field) in the response
    meta.pagination object. Stop paginating when page_items_count is less than limit
    or when page exceeds total_items_count divided by limit.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with limit and page parameters in the response.
    The response includes pagination metadata with limit (50), page (10), page_items_count
    (43), and total_items_count (493) fields. To paginate, increment the page parameter
    in subsequent requests until page_items_count is less than limit or page reaches
    the calculated maximum page count from total_items_count divided by limit.
