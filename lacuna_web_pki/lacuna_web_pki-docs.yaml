auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/requesting-timestamps.html:
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header `Authorization: Bearer <token de acesso ao Rest PKI>` with each request
    to the REST PKI API endpoint. The token must be obtained separately and represents
    access credentials to the Rest PKI service.'
  - Rest PKI uses bearer token authentication. Generate an access token from the Rest
    PKI Control Panel, then send it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>"
    for both TSP (Timestamp Protocol) and REST API communication.
- information_source; https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/core/on-premises/configure-timestamp.html:
  - 'Timestamping configuration supports two authentication types. For OAuthBearerToken,
    include the BearerToken value in the Authorization header as a bearer token. For
    BasicAuthentication, use the Username and Password fields, which are Base64-encoded
    and sent in the Authorization header.


    Key fields: AuthenticationType (set to OAuthBearerToken or BasicAuthentication),
    BearerToken (for OAuth), Username and Password (for basic auth). Configuration
    is set in the Timestamp:Timestampers section with Url, AuthenticationType, and
    appropriate credentials.'
- information_source; https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/core/on-premises/configure-oidc.html:
  - Rest PKI Core uses OAuth2 client credentials flow via GrantID for authentication.
    Configuration requires setting the OIDC Authority, API Endpoint, ClientAppId (restpkicore),
    AppId (restpkicore-backend), and AppSecret (generated backend application secret)
    either in configuration files under the [Oidc] section or as environment variables
    prefixed with Oidc__ (e.g., Oidc__Authority, Oidc__AppSecret, Oidc__ClientAppId).
- information_source; https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/core/requesting-timestamps.html:
  - 'API key authentication via HTTP header. Send requests with the Authorization
    header set to `ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY`, where YOUR_API_KEY is the generated API key
    value. This applies to both TSP protocol (POST to `https://restpkicore.yourcompany.com/tsp`)
    and REST API (POST to `https://restpkicore.yourcompany.com/api/tsp`). For REST
    API, also include `Content-Type: application/json` header. Optionally append `/TIER`
    to the URL to specify a tier (e.g., `PkiBrazil` or `LacunaTest` for SaaS).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/signer/on-premises/administration.html:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with optional query parameter q for filtering.
    Response includes totalCount field and nextCursor field; when nextCursor is null,
    there are no more pages to retrieve.
  - Offset-based pagination is used with optional limit (items per page) and offset
    (page number) query parameters. Response includes nextCursor field; when nextCursor
    is null, there are no more pages.
  - Pagination uses limit (optional, items per page) and offset (optional, page number)
    as query parameters. Response includes items array, totalCount field, and nextCursor
    field (null when no more pages).
  - limit (query parameter, optional) controls items per page; offset (query parameter,
    optional) specifies page number. Response includes items array, totalCount field,
    and nextCursor field (null when no more pages).
