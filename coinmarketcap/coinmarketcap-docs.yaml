pagination_info:
- information_source; https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/:
  - Pagination uses optional "limit" query parameter (integer, range 1-500, default
    50) to specify results per page, and "start" parameter to determine pagination
    size and offset for custom pagination control.
  - Pagination uses start (1-based index, optional, default 1) and limit (optional,
    range 1-5000) query parameters to control offset and page size. The response returns
    a data array of results; construct subsequent requests by incrementing the start
    parameter.
  - Use the "start" parameter (1-based index, >= 1) to offset the paginated list and
    "limit" parameter (1-5000, default 1) to specify results per request. Construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing the start value by the limit amount until
    all desired results are retrieved.
  - Use the query parameters "start" (1-based offset, default 1) and "limit" (number
    of results, default 100, range 1-5000) to paginate. Construct subsequent requests
    by incrementing "start" by the "limit" value from the previous response.
