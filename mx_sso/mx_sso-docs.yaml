auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/mx-platform-api:
  - The MX Platform API requires HTTP Basic Authentication using client_id and api_key
    credentials. These credentials must be Base64 encoded and included in the Authorization
    header of each API request. Additionally, the Accept-Version header must be set
    to specify the API version (e.g., v20250224). Bearer Auth is also supported as
    an alternative authentication method.
- information_source; https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/more-apis/data-enhancement-off-platform/:
  - API key authentication is required and must be provided with requests. The API
    key is validated against the client IP address, and a 401 Unauthorized response
    indicates no valid API key was provided, while a 403 Forbidden response indicates
    IP mismatch or service not enabled for the client. The exact mechanism for sending
    the API key (header name, parameter name, or other method) is not specified in
    the provided documentation.
- information_source; https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/atrium:
  - 'API requests require two authentication headers: MX-API-Key (your API key) and
    MX-Client-ID (your client ID). Both must be included as HTTP headers in every
    request to the API.'
  - 'All requests are authenticated with two tokens sent in request headers: MX-API-Key
    and MX-Client-ID. These tokens are environment-specific (separate tokens for production
    and development) and must be kept secret. Development tokens are available on
    your profile page at https://dashboard.mx.com/security. Requests must use HTTPS
    with TLSv1.2 or higher encryption.'
  - 'The API requires two custom headers for authentication: MX-API-Key (your API
    key) and MX-Client-ID (your client ID). Both must be included in request headers
    when making API calls to Atrium endpoints.'
