auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.rag.progress.cloud/docs/api:
  - Authenticated requests require the user to have specific roles. For read operations,
    the READER role is required; for write operations, the WRITER role is required.
    Requests without proper role authorization will receive a 403 response. The exact
    mechanism for passing authentication credentials (headers, tokens, etc.) is not
    specified in this documentation.
  - 'Authenticated requests require the user to have the READER role. The following
    headers are used for authentication and user identification: x-ndb-client (NucliaDB
    client identifier), x-nucliadb-user (user identifier), and x-forwarded-for (client
    IP address). Requests from users without the READER role are rejected with a 403
    response.'
  - Authenticated requests require the user to have the WRITER role. The request must
    include the x-nucliadb-user header (string value). An authenticated user lacking
    the WRITER role will receive a 403 response.
  - Authenticated user must have either WRITER role (for add/modify operations) or
    READER role (for get operations), otherwise requests are rejected with 403 response.
    Authentication mechanism and credential passing method are not specified in this
    documentation excerpt.
  - Authenticated user must have the WRITER role to access these endpoints. Requests
    without proper authentication will be rejected with a 403 response. The documentation
    indicates role-based authorization is required but does not specify the authentication
    mechanism (e.g., header name, token type, or credential format).
