auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.lingo24.com/business-translation-api:
  - OAuth2 access token acquisition endpoint. Send a POST request with a previously
    supplied refresh token or authorization code (obtained from the authorize endpoint)
    to receive an access_token, refresh_token, and expires_in. The authorization endpoint
    URL is https://ease-demo.lingo24.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}.
  - OAuth2 access token endpoint using authorization code or refresh token flow. Submit
    client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, grant_type (authorization_code or refresh_token),
    and code parameters as form data to obtain access_token, refresh_token, and expires_in
    in the JSON response. The redirect_uri must match the value used when the authorization
    code was originally generated.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with client credentials. Send client_id, client_secret,
    redirect_uri, grant_type (authorization_code or refresh_token), and code as formData
    parameters in the token request. The redirect_uri must match the value used when
    the authorization code was originally generated.
- information_source; https://developer.lingo24.com/key-patterns:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with client_id and redirect_uri parameters. After
    obtaining an authorization_code, exchange it at the /oauth2/access endpoint for
    an access_code. Additionally, the Premium MT API requires User_Key authentication
    where authenticated requests must include a user_key parameter containing your
    application's user_key.
  - 'OAuth2 is used for the Business Documents API. Requests must include the Authorization
    header with a Bearer token: Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}. To obtain
    an access token, redirect users to https://ease.lingo24.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={callback_url}
    where client_id is obtained from the developer portal. User_Key is also mentioned
    as an alternative authentication mechanism for other APIs.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.lingo24.com/business-translation-api:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit specifies result set
    size, offset specifies starting position. Both are optional integers. Response
    is an array of domain objects with no explicit pagination metadata fields.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (result set limit) and offset (result set
    offset), both integers. Use limit to specify the number of results per request
    and offset to specify the starting position for the result set.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (result set limit) and offset (result set
    offset), both optional integers. Stop paginating when fewer results than the limit
    are returned or when offset exceeds available results.
  - Returns a page of files with pagination metadata. Response includes links array
    with rel and href for navigation, content array with file objects, and page metadata
    containing size, totalElements, totalPages, and number fields to track pagination
    state.
  - The API supports pagination via a query parameter "page" (integer) for page number.
    No response pagination fields, headers, or stopping conditions are documented.
