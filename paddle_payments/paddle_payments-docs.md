In this guide, we'll set up a complete Paddle data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def paddle_payments_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.paddle.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "brand-customize-inline-checkout",
            "paddle/paddle.js",
            "checkout"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='paddle_payments_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='paddle_payments_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(paddle_payments_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from paddle_payments‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Checkout Customization: Allows for customization of the checkout experience including language and payment method restrictions.
- Client-Side Token Initialization: Manages client-side token initialization for transactions.
- Checkout Management: Handles checkout operations like opening, updating, and setting checkout items.
- Environment Settings: Manages the settings for sandbox or live environments.
- Pricing Information: Retrieves and manages price and product information, ensuring correct currency and tax calculations.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Paddle workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@paddle_payments-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Paddle support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:paddle_payments duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Paddle API, as specified in @paddle_payments-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "brand-customize-inline-checkout" and "paddle/paddle.js" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in paddle_payments_pipeline.py and name the pipeline paddle_payments_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python paddle_payments_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication requires an API key included in headers of requests. The key is used for server-side operations, while client-side token is used for actions within Paddle.js.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.paddle.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python paddle_payments_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline paddle_payments load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset paddle_payments_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/paddle_payments.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline paddle_payments_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("paddle_payments_pipeline").dataset()
   # get brand-customize-inline-checkout table as Pandas frame
   data.brand-customize-inline-checkout.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Paddle requires careful handling of client-side and server-side tokens for authentication. It's important to manage the environment settings correctly between sandbox and live modes to avoid issues with domain approval and payment processing. Webhooks must be set up correctly to receive transaction notifications, and API keys should be rotated periodically for security.
