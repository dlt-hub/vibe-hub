auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.autograb.com.au/guide/:
  - API keys are required for authentication. Your account manager provisions API
    keys for your account. The documentation does not specify the exact header name
    or parameter name where the API key should be sent, nor does it provide details
    on how to include the key in requests.
- information_source; https://docs.autograb.com.au/guide/oauth/:
  - AutoGrab APIs support OAuth2 client credentials grant flow for authentication.
    Obtain a valid OAuth token by sending a POST request to the auth-broker endpoint
    with your client_id and client_secret (provided by your sales rep). Include the
    valid token when making REST API calls to sign requests. Tokens must be refreshed
    periodically to maintain a valid token available in your system.
  - 'AutoGrab uses OAuth2 client credentials flow. Obtain a bearer token by sending
    a POST request to https://api.autograb.com.au/auth-broker/request-token with Basic
    Auth (client_id:client_secret Base64 encoded) and grant_type=client_credentials
    in the request body. Then include the returned access_token in subsequent API
    calls using the Authorization header with Bearer prefix format: Authorization:
    Bearer [access_token]. The token expires after the expires_in seconds returned
    in the response, so implement token refresh logic before expiry.'
- information_source; https://docs.autograb.com.au/guide/vehicle/:
  - 'API Key authentication is required. Send the API key in the `ApiKey` header with
    each request to the endpoint. The header format is `ApiKey: {API_KEY}` where {API_KEY}
    is your actual API key value.'
  - 'API key authentication is required, sent as the ApiKey header in all requests.
    The API key value should be placed in the ApiKey header (e.g., -H ''ApiKey: {API_KEY}''),
    and a region parameter (au, nz, or my) must also be provided in the query string.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.autograb.com.au/guide/recapture/:
  - This list is paginated using offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter
    specifies the starting position and limit parameter specifies the number of records
    per page. You can also filter by upload_id query parameter to get customers from
    a specific upload.
