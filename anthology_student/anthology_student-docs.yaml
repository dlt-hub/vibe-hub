auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.anthology.com/docs/blackboard/rest-apis/getting-started/basic-authentication:
  - 'Basic authentication is used to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token by sending Base64-encoded
    key:secret credentials via the Authorization header with the -u switch. The returned
    access_token is then used in subsequent API requests via the Authorization header
    with Bearer token_type, and tokens expire after 1 hour.


    Exact details: Initial request uses Basic auth header with Base64-encoded credentials.
    OAuth 2.0 response includes access_token, token_type (bearer), and expires_in
    (3600 seconds). Subsequent requests use Authorization header with format "Bearer
    {access_token}". Tokens are site-specific and one token per application per Learn
    site; requesting a new token returns the existing one with updated expiry if not
    expired.'
  - OAuth 2.0 RFC Standard is used for authentication. Each developer receives a unique
    key and secret for their application. To authenticate, make an HTTP POST request
    to the REST-enabled Learn server to obtain an OAuth access token, which is valid
    for one hour. Use this token in subsequent REST API calls via the Authorization
    header until it expires. The Learn instance forwards the token request to Anthology's
    Developer Portal, which validates the application registration and returns the
    access token.
  - The API uses OAuth2 with client credentials flow. To authenticate, first obtain
    an access token by sending a POST request to `/learn/api/public/v1/oauth2/token`
    with HTTP Basic authentication using your application key and secret (via the
    -u flag or Authorization header with Base64-encoded "key:secret"). Then include
    the token in subsequent requests using the Authorization header set to "Bearer
    <access_token>". The grant_type parameter must be set to "client_credentials"
    in the token request body.
  - This API uses OAuth 2.0 with Basic authentication for token acquisition, followed
    by Bearer token authentication for subsequent requests. To obtain an access token,
    send a POST request with an Authorization header containing "Basic" followed by
    a space and a base64-encoded string of "client_id:client_secret", and include
    "grant_type=client_credentials" in the request body. The server returns an access_token
    field in the response. Use this token in the Authorization header as "Bearer"
    followed by a space and the token value for all subsequent REST API calls.
- information_source; https://docs.anthology.com/docs/blackboard/uef/how-it-works:
  - The REST API uses 3-Legged OAuth flow for authentication. After receiving a JWT
    token from Learn via LTI, redirect the request to the REST API authentication
    endpoint to obtain a bearer token. The token can be scoped using specific scope
    values such as "*" for all scopes, "ultra:analytics-eve" for analytics events,
    "ultra:help" for help provider functionality, or other available scopes depending
    on the application integration needs.
