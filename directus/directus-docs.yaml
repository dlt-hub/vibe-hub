auth_info:
- information_source; https://learndirectus.com/graphql-vs-rest-api/:
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer your-bearer-token" in all requests to the Directus
    API endpoint.'
  - 'Authorization requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer your-bearer-token" in requests to the GraphQL
    and REST API endpoints.'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer your-bearer-token header is required for GraphQL mutations.
    Supply the bearer token in the Authorization header when making POST requests
    to the GraphQL endpoint.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer your-bearer-token" for both GraphQL and REST
    API requests to the Directus endpoint.'
  - 'Directus API uses Bearer Token authentication. The token is obtained from the
    User Management portal and must be passed in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer your-bearer-token" for both GraphQL and REST API requests. In Postman,
    paste the token in the Authorization tab Token field.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://learndirectus.com/graphql-vs-rest-api/:
  - 'Pagination in GraphQL queries uses limit and page parameters. The limit parameter
    specifies the number of records per page, and the page parameter specifies which
    page to retrieve (starting from page 1). For example, limit: 100 and page: 2 returns
    records 101-200.'
  - The REST API uses limit and page query parameters for pagination. The limit parameter
    (e.g., limit=100) sets the number of results per page, and the page parameter
    (e.g., page=2) specifies which page to retrieve. Both parameters are optional
    and work together to control result offset and batch size.
