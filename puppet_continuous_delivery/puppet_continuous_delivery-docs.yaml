  - 'Any authenticated user can create workspaces. API requests require an Authorization
    header with a token value in the format "Authorization: <token value>". The workspace
    ID is passed as a query parameter (workspaceId) to identify which workspace to
    operate within. VCS provider integration requests also include a Content-Type:
    application/json header.'
  - 'Personal access token authentication is required for all API calls. Include the
    token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: <token value>" when making
    requests to the REST API endpoints.'

  - The `/v1/tokens` API requires an authentication token in the header. The older
    `/v1/authtokens` API has been replaced and is no longer available in the OpenAPI
