notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- User needs to provide parameter and target values for execution
- Make a GET request to indicate which existing plan you want to execute.
- Fill in the desired parameter values and targets for each step and then POST it
  back.
- Make a GET request to indicate which existing plan to execute and POST the execution
  skeleton back.
- Make a GET request to indicate which existing plan to execute, then fill in parameters
  and POST back.
- Specifying the ContentType header as application/xml when sending requests.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Using the APIs, branding, ClientUI dashboards, Console extensions and dashboards.
- How to use and troubleshoot the REST API, SOAP API or Server API for the IEM platform,
  and the REST API for SUA and SCA.
- Setup and use of BigFix and its applications.
- WebUI will update automatically by default, unless configured otherwise.
- Updates for BigFix Insights must be done manually via the Application Updates page
  on WebUI.
- There is a defect in bigfix 11.0.4 that does not properly return all relevant fixlets
  on all devices though webreports and the bigfix API(which uses webreports).
- There is a defect in bigfix 11.0.4 that does not properly return all relevant fixlets
  on all devices though webreports and the bigfix API.
- Not officially supported for Ubuntu arm64.
- Consider using event log name 'Microsoft-Windows-BitLocker/BitLocker Management'
  for accurate querying.
- Using relevance code to filter event logs may lead to performance issues on larger
  logs.
- Running a command should be considered a last resort when trying to retrieve information
  from endpoints via BigFix.
- If the data is already available in a standard or predictable file location, we
  can help you write a relevance expression that reads it directly eliminating the
  need for a policy action altogether.
- Starting from BigFix Versions 10.0.9 and later, during the Plugin Portal upgrade,
  the MongoDB table, if present, gets migrated.
- The migration of the reports from the MongoDB will not require manual steps; it
  will be automatically executed at the initial startup of the Plugin Portal after
  upgrading to BigFix Version 10.0.9.
- All reports present in the MongoDB table are migrated into the new SQLite database.
- After the migration, the MongoDB table is dropped and the Plugin Portal will work
  with SQLite databases only.
- If the migration step fails, the MongoDB table continues to exist and will not lose
  any data.
- Both analysis and remediation checks are included
- Some of the checks allow you to use the parameterized setting to enable customization
  for compliance evaluation.
- Some of the checks allow you to use the parameterized setting to enable customization
  for compliance evaluation. Note that parameterization and remediation actions require
  the creation of a custom site.
- 'Improved few checks by adding the pending restart feature to them. The pending
  restart feature works in the following ways: The action results will show “Pending
  Restart” instead of “Fixed” for those checks which requires OS reboot. The check
  will show relevant for those endpoints until they are rebooted. Post reboot of the
  endpoint the action results will show as “Fixed”, and the check will be compliant.'
- Some of the checks allow you to use the parameterized setting to enable customization
  for compliance evaluation
- Improved few checks by adding the pending restart feature to them
- If you are using v11.0.2 or later you can use the `linux of operating system` inspector
  to detect a distro of Linux.
- If using v11.0.2 or later, you can use the `linux of operating system` inspector
  to detect a distro of Linux.
- To apply new discovery capability, run the Server Software Catalog Update Fixlet
  (BigFix Inventory Discovery site) from the BigFix console and then wait for the
  next data import.
- This action will never expire.
- It will run at any time of day, on any day of the week.
- If the action becomes relevant after it has successfully executed, the action will
  be reapplied as a policy an unlimited number of times.
- If the action fails, it will be retried up to 99 times, waiting until the computer
  is rebooted between attempts.
- The action’s start times will be staggered over 5 minutes to reduce network load.
- Most computers are getting the software just fine, but a few seem to be stuck with
  a Summary of 'Waiting to satisfy temporal distribution time constraint'.
- This topic will automatically close in a month.
- Ensure to escape the trailing '}' of the GUID to prevent relevance substitution
  expression terminating too soon.
- Using /qn may not suppress uninstall confirmation prompts.
- 'Total New Fixlets: 0'
- 'Total Updated Fixlets: 25'
- 'Release Date: 2025-10-15'
- The Windows 2008 ESU program ended 9 January 2024, but Microsoft has continued releasing
  patches.
- For Roles, you can use REST /api/roles and check under <ComputerAssignments> <ByGroup
  Name for Operators as well.
- 'Total Updated Fixlets: 32'
- 'Total Fixlets in Site: 488'
- 'New Fixlets: No Fixlets Added In This Release'
- 'Total Fixlets in Site: 500'
- XML data is required to execute the automation plan via API.
- You must provide the XML data from the plan itself to represent the required steps
  and target for this plan to run.
- The plan is actually created, but may lack data to be properly handled by the BigFix
  SA module.
- Using Platform - 11.0.3
- When a Fixlet/Baseline contains special characters like &, <, and > in the action
  script, the BigFix Server Automation doesn’t properly parse the content.
- The plan details are stored in the Fixlet’s actionscript.
- You will need to replace the masthead on the Client machines given that you’ll not
  be re-using the original masthead on the Server.
- Requires setup of connected app in Splunk
- Verbose logging enabled during installation
- The API allows for creating plans using Fixlets and baselines.
- Command may stay in state of running if there's an error message that cannot be
  displayed.
- Use relevance scripts to delete settings starting with '_BESClient_ArchiveManager_FileSet-'
- 'Output should look like: Java-1.8.0 or Java-1.9.0'
- The built-in script type for PowerShell runs in 64-bit mode.
- All jobs fail with Exit Code 1 and never install.
- Files are downloaded to C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\__BESData\actionsite\__Download.
- Uses HTTP GET for accessing endpoints.
- Direct download links provided for files.
- There is no ability to process Relevance (like Parameter values) using the PowerShell
  script type.
- When writing the PowerShell file, be sure to escape the open-cirly symbol { as {{,
  to prevent Relevance substitutions where you don’t want them.
- Efficient queries can be achieved by using sets for filtering.
- Spaces where the culprit.
- Once it’s in the set, unwinding the elements of the set does not require performing
  a new search across every fixlet and filter those to match the condition.
- In a data set of 10 computers and 20 fixlets, it does 30 lookups instead of 200.
- When unwinding the sets, we can end up with 10x20=200 unique combinations, but retrieving
  those combinations from the set takes almost no time at all.
- The ‘bes computers’ inspector is for Session Relevance, not Client Relevance. You
  can use Session Relevance in REST API, Web Reports custom reports, and Dashboards.
- Ensure the install.xml file is accessible at the specified path.
- It is not uncommon for BigFix to detect a pending restart that is unrelated to the
  patch installation.
- Non-admin user detection through ProfileList location in the registry
- Requires setup of connected app in BigFix
- Spaces where the culprit in LGPO parsing — needs completely empty lines
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Uses registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
  to identify deleted profiles.
- The server installed post-patch components even though it did not have Pending Restart
  status at sight
- Current version of BigFix is v11.0.4
- winget will not run as system
- Use remove-appxpackage to remove 'Windows Web Experience Pack'
- Use regset64 on 64-bit computers to avoid registry redirection issues.
- BigFix does not provide anything like this out of the box by default.
- Action script may require adjustments for successful uninstallation.
- Relevance statement to detect multiple logged on users.
- BigFix Web Report shows machine compliance state and relevant fixlet is installed
  but actually it’s not compliance.
- Seems like microsoft has removed the url. it is no longer accessible.
- This issue is acknowledged and we will work to address this inconvenient issue with
  this wizard.
- Running Check Results and exporting around 500k lines as CSV may not complete and
  can hang.
- Consider strategic filtering to cope with large volumes, such as by computer group.
- You’ll need to determine a reliable method of identifying it locally first.
- Assuming you are Windows only OS you can parse the version for the service name.
- Depending on the size of your estate, an approach you could use is an analysis that
  is only relevant when the CbDefense service exists.
- Uses local commands to manage user access.
- Operating system filtering is supported.
- The action is considered Failed if the user closes the window during a restart.
- Enables self-monitoring, reducing dependency on external monitoring tools.
- Addresses the needs of mid-range customers who prefer not to invest in separate
  monitoring tools for BigFix infrastructure.
- Changing the default browser via script is blocked in Windows 10/11, due to large
  number of exploits that changed browsers.
- Unfortunately when MS releases the new version, they deactivate the download link
  for the old version.
- Fixlet will re-run the whole script after reboot if the reboot wasn't triggered
  by the ActionScript 'restart' command.
- Runas command does not accept a 'password=' parameter.
- Could be a few things throwing the calculation in the Windows directory, including
  perhaps Directory Junctions / Symlinks.
- Your safer approach may be to use a task to execute a PowerShell command to total
  up the file sizes.
- Error 1605 indicates the action is only valid for products that are currently installed.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in BigFix
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- cmd.exe is keeps on running even after uninstall.
- BigFix Web Report shows completed and compliance but actual patch may not be installed.
- Validation mechanism for patch installation is needed.
- Download links has been updated, please gather Client Manager for Endpoint Protection
  site version 5,568.
- There is no published limit on the number of rows that can be exported.
- You need to determine a reliable method of identifying ControlVault locally.
- Usually action execution is ruled by action settings, rather than action parameters
- You can use/add 'utc time flag of action of it' if its true then UTC time zone is
  selected else client local time zone.
- '''restart flag of action of it'''
- This command may complete with exit code=2 if the users were not added to the Administrators
  group.
- 'The following months do not have an MSRT update: December 2023, December 2024,
  March 2025, April 2025'
- Runas does not provide a way to supply the password on the command line.
- Using the following relevance statement but it is returning incorrect information.
- For environments where security is paramount, allowing only the necessary download
  URLs is crucial.
- My initial thought is that you may need to run the rpm-gpg-key import task against
  this machine. If you do that, and the issue persists, I would suggest opening a
  case with support.
- Some actions may not have results and will be excluded from the list.
- Dataset can be downloaded and used for educational, analytical purposes.
- '''restart flag of action of it'' for post action reboot.'
- The '@' prefix for shortcuts is a feature for manual site search creation in Chrome,
  but it’s not supported when defining SiteSearchSettings via Windows Registry policies.
