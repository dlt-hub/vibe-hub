auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.identitysoon.com/iiq/api/get-entitlement-by-id/index.html:
  - The documentation indicates basic authentication is required. Send requests with
    a Username and Password, which should be provided as HTTP Basic Authentication
    credentials (base64-encoded in the Authorization header as "Basic [base64(username:password)]").
- information_source; https://developer.identitysoon.com/idn/api/getting-started:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used to authenticate API requests. Exchange
    client_id and client_secret via POST to https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={secret}
    to obtain an access_token. Include the access_token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {access_token}" for subsequent API requests. Rate limit is 100 requests
    per access_token per 10 seconds.
  - Personal access tokens are used to generate access tokens for API authentication.
    Create a personal access token in IdentityNow (via Preferences > Personal Access
    Tokens) which yields a Client ID and Secret. Use these credentials with the OAuth2
    client credentials flow to obtain an access_token by sending a request to the
    token endpoint, then include the access_token in the Authorization header as a
    Bearer token for subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://developer.identitysoon.com/idn/api/authentication:
  - Client Credentials OAuth2 flow is used to obtain access tokens by posting client_id
    and client_secret to https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/oauth/token. The response
    contains an access_token (JWT) that must be sent in the Authorization header as
    a Bearer token for subsequent API requests. The token includes scope information
    (read, write) and an expiration time (exp claim).
  - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow is used for authentication. Send a POST request
    to https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/oauth/token with grant_type set to CLIENT_CREDENTIALS,
    along with client_id and client_secret. These credentials can be passed as form-data,
    url-encoded data in the request body, or as query parameters in the URL. Alternatively,
    use the Authorization tab in Postman with the token endpoint specified.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.identitysoon.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with a `limit` query parameter (default 100)
    to control page size. To paginate, extract the `id` value from the last record
    in the response and pass it as the `searchAfter` property in the request body
    for the next query. Continue until no records are returned.
