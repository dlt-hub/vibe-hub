auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.sift.com/docs:
  - 'API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with the REST API key. Replace ${YOUR_API_KEY}
    with your REST API key from the API Keys tab in the Developer page on the Console,
    and pass it as the username in the -u flag with an empty password (format: -u
    ${YOUR_API_KEY}:). The API key must be included in every request to authenticate.'
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with your API key as the username and
    an empty password. Include the Authorization header with the format `-u {YOUR_API_KEY}:`
    in curl requests, or pass `api_key='{apiKey}'` to the sift.Client constructor
    in Python.
  - 'API key authentication is required and placement depends on the API being called:
    for the Labels API and Events API, the API key goes in the JSON request body;
    for the Scores API, the API key appears as a query parameter.'
  - 'API key authentication is required, passed as the username in HTTP Basic Auth
    (with empty password). The API key is provided via the -u flag in curl as {YOUR_API_KEY}:
    or configured in the client library via the api_key parameter.'
  - 'API key authentication is required, passed via HTTP Basic Auth. Include the API
    key as the username with an empty password in the `-u` flag (format: `-u {API_KEY}:`),
    or set the Authorization header to `Basic base64({API_KEY}:)`. The API key can
    be found in the Sift Console under the Developer Tab.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.sift.com/docs:
  - Pagination uses limit and from query parameters to control page size and offset.
    The response includes has_more boolean and next_ref field containing the full
    URL for the next page request; stop paginating when has_more is false.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: from (starting offset, optional) and
    limit (page size, optional, default 10). Response includes has_more boolean field
    and next_ref URL field containing the full next request URL with updated from
    parameter for retrieving subsequent pages.'
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: from (starting position, default 0)
    and limit (number of results per page). The response includes a data array of
    decisions. To retrieve the next page, increment the from parameter by the limit
    value and resubmit the request.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters batch_size (integer for page size) and batch_token
    (string for page position). The response includes next_ref field to reference
    the next page. Use batch_token value from the previous response as the batch_token
    parameter in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters batch_size (integer, optional) and batch_token
    (string, optional) to control page size and position. The response includes next_ref
    (string reference for the next batch) and has_more (boolean indicating if additional
    pages exist); use next_ref as batch_token in the subsequent request to iterate
    through pages.
