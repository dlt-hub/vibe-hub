auth_info:
- information_source; https://favqs.com/api:
  - 'An app token is required for most API calls (except Quote of the Day). Pass your
    access token in the Authorization header using the format: Authorization: Token
    token="YOUR_APP_TOKEN". The token value goes inside the token parameter within
    the Authorization header.'
  - Authentication uses session-based tokens. After user creation or login, a "User-Token"
    is returned and must be included in the Authorization header (or as a custom header
    named "User-Token") for subsequent requests that require authentication. The token
    is a string value like "i4dwXAUNfSUEaTP90K5RWOWLap5cvc9mtjfpvA+c0uufP5GYnpYZUO4k5pTEpwsJHVHNhY5lbLn0cDRpiwsOKA==".
    User login requires "login" and "password" fields in the request body. Session
    logout is performed via DELETE /api/session. If no user session is found, error
    code 20 is returned.
  - 'Authorization header with app token: set Authorization header to Token token="YOUR_APP_TOKEN".
    For user sessions, pass User-Token header with "USER_SESSION_TOKEN". Both use
    the format Header: "value" where double quotes are optional.'
  - To create a user session, POST to /api/session with a JSON body containing user.login
    (username or email) and user.password. The response includes a User-Token header
    value that must be added to the header for subsequent requests requiring user
    authentication.
- information_source; https://favqs.com/api/v1:
  - 'A token is required to access the FavQs API (except for the Quote of the Day
    endpoint). Pass your access token via the Authorization header with the format:
    Authorization: Token token="YOUR_TOKEN". The token should be your application
    token obtained from FavQs.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://favqs.com/api:
  - The API returns paginated lists of quotes with 25 results per page. Use the "page"
    query parameter (default 1) to request specific pages. The response includes "page"
    (current page number) and "last_page" (boolean indicating if more pages exist);
    stop paginating when last_page is true.
  - The endpoint supports pagination via a page query parameter that specifies the
    page number, with each page returning 25 activities. The response body contains
    an activities array but does not explicitly show next/previous fields or total
    count information in the provided documentation.
  - The page parameter is a query parameter for pagination, returning 25 quotes per
    page. The documentation does not specify response fields indicating total pages,
    next page, or when to stop paginating.
  - The response includes page and last_page fields. Use page value in subsequent
    requests to navigate; stop when last_page is true. However, no explicit pagination
    request parameter is documented.
- information_source; https://favqs.com/api/v1:
  - Use optional query parameter page for page number (25 quotes per page). Response
    includes page field indicating current page and last_page boolean field; stop
    paginating when last_page is true.
