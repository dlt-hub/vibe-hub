auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/integrations/oauth-integrations/sharepoint/:
  - The SharePoint Online integration requires OAuth2 authentication configured in
    Microsoft Entra. For Viewer Integration, register an OAuth application in Microsoft
    Entra with a redirect URI of `https://connect.example.org/__oauth__/integrations/callback`
    (replace `connect.example.org` with your Connect server address); Azure will send
    user credentials to this URI during the OAuth handshake, allowing Posit Connect
    to obtain temporary access and refresh tokens. Service Account Integration is
    also mentioned but details are incomplete in the provided text.

  - Authentication uses an API key passed in the Authorization header. The header
    must be set to "Key {connect_api_key}" where connect_api_key is obtained from
    an environment variable. The API key is required for all requests to the Posit
    Connect audit logs endpoint.
  - Posit Connect uses API Key authentication. The API key is obtained from the CONNECT_API_KEY
    environment variable and sent in the Authorization header with the format "Key
    {api_key_value}". The server URL is obtained from the CONNECT_SERVER environment
    variable.
  - Posit Connect uses API Key authentication. The API key must be passed in the Authorization
    header with the format "Key {api_key}". The server URL and API key are obtained
    from the CONNECT_SERVER and CONNECT_API_KEY environment variables respectively.
  - The API uses an API Key authentication scheme. Obtain the Connect server URL from
    the CONNECT_SERVER environment variable and the API Key from the CONNECT_API_KEY
    environment variable. Include the API Key in the Authorization header with the
    format "Key {api_key}" when making requests to the API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.posit.co/connect/cookbook/pagination/:
  - Keyset (cursor) pagination is used for audit logs. Request the first page via
    GET /v1/audit_logs with a limit parameter (default 25 entries per page). The response
    includes a paging.next field containing the URL for the next page; continue paginating
    by following this URL until paging.next is NULL.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page_number and page_size. Requests are made
    to GET /__api__/v1/users with page_size (e.g., 25) and page_number parameters.
    The response contains a results array and current_page field. Increment page_number
    until no results are returned to stop pagination.
  - The `/v1/audit_logs` endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. Request the first
    page with optional `limit` query parameter (default 25 records per page). The
    response contains a `paging.next` field with the URL for the next page; continue
    requesting until `paging.next` is null or empty.
  - Use `page_size` query parameter (default 25) to control page size, and `current_page`
    in the response to track pagination. Increment `current_page` and request the
    next page; stop when the `results` array is empty.
