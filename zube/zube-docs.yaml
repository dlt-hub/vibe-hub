auth_info:
- information_source; https://zube.io/blog/introducing-zube-s-public-api/:
  - Authentication is done with user tokens (JWTs). You need to issue yourself a JWT
    and include it in requests so that changes are properly attributed to you. The
    full details of how to obtain and use the JWT are found in the API documentation.
- information_source; https://zube.io/docs/api:
  - 'Authentication uses bearer token and client ID. Include the header "Authorization:
    Bearer ACCESS_JWT" with your JWT access token and the header "X-Client-ID: CLIENT_ID"
    with your client ID in all requests. For requests with body data, also include
    "Content-Type: application/json" header.'
  - Authorization header with Bearer token (ACCESS_JWT) and X-Client-ID header with
    CLIENT_ID value are required for API requests. Send the Bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ACCESS_JWT" and the client ID in the X-Client-ID header.
  - 'Authorization requires two headers: send a JWT in the Authorization header as
    "Bearer ACCESS_JWT" and include your CLIENT_ID in the X-Client-ID header.'
  - The API uses JWT-based authentication with a two-step flow. First, generate a
    refresh JWT signed with RS256 using your client_id and private key (PEM format),
    with claims iat, exp (max 10 minutes), and iss set to client_id. Then POST to
    /api/users/tokens with the refresh JWT in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    REFRESH_JWT" and your client_id in the X-Client-ID header to obtain an access
    JWT. Use the access JWT in the Authorization header as "Bearer ACCESS_JWT" for
    all subsequent API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://zube.io/docs/api:
  - Paginated list endpoints default to 30 items per page. Use the `page` query parameter
    to specify the page number, and optionally use `per_page` query parameter to customize
    results per page. The documentation does not specify response fields indicating
    pagination state or when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page and per_page (optional, default per_page
    is 30). Response includes pagination object with page, per_page, total_pages,
    and total fields to indicate current position and total available pages.
