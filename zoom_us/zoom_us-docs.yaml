  - 'I need to extract endpoint definitions from this OpenAPI specification. Let me
    identify the endpoints present.


    From the OpenAPI document provided, I can see:'
  - 'One example endpoint mentioned in the description: listing all users via `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/`


    However, the document appears to be incomplete (it cuts off at the end). The `paths`
    section of the OpenAPI specification, which would contain the actual endpoint
    definitions, is not included in the provided text.


    Based on what is explicitly stated in the documentation:'
  - PATCH /chat/users/me/channels/{channelId}
  - PATCH /rooms/account/settings
