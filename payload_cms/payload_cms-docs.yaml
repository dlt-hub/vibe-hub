auth_info:
- information_source; https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/api-keys:
  - API key authentication is required. Set the `Authorization` header with the format
    `{collection_slug} API-Key {apiKey}`, where collection_slug is the slug of the
    auth.useAPIKey enabled collection and apiKey is the assigned API key value. API
    keys are encrypted in the database and regeneration is required if PAYLOAD_SECRET
    changes.
- information_source; https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/operations:
  - Authentication on a Collection automatically exposes auth-based operations across
    Local API, REST API, and GraphQL API. The Access operation (GET /api/access) returns
    what a logged-in user can and cannot do with collections and globals based on
    Access Control rules.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://payloadcms.com/docs/queries/pagination:
  - 'Use query parameters limit and page to paginate REST API responses. Responses
    include docs array and metadata fields: totalDocs, totalPages, page, hasNextPage,
    nextPage, hasPrevPage, prevPage. Stop paginating when hasNextPage is false or
    nextPage is null.'
