notes:
- All currently developed and supported versions of the Joomla! CMS and Framework
  will be actively monitored by the JSST.
- 'Currently active versions include: Joomla! CMS - 3.x + 4.x, Joomla! Framework -
  1.x + 2.x'
- Joomla! has great plans for the future of the project.
- The Joomla! Security Strike Team (JSST) have published a GPG key to receive signed
  and encrypted mail.
- The stripImages and stripIframes methods didn't properly process inputs, leading
  to XSS vectors.
- As an open source project, Joomla’s direction is defined by its volunteers and available
  resources, therefore all dates are tentative and the proposed focus for each release
  is subject to modification.
- Statistics data is collected anonymously.
- Data is publicly available through the public API.
- When reporting a security issue in Joomla! an email should be sent to the Joomla!
  Security Strike Team (JSST) at security@joomla.org
- Joomla! development is open to anyone.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Developers are encouraged to take an active approach with the Framework and future
  updates and development.
- If you find an issue in the Framework and cannot fix the issue directly then the
  next step is to report the problem.
- This beta version of Joomla 6.0 is not suitable for production sites. It is for
  testing only.
- Please note that dates may be subject to change depending on the availability of
  volunteers and circumstances beyond our control.
- Uses Semantic Versioning for version numbering.
- Backward compatibility is prioritized.
- You can load any UI framework you want, but keep in mind, do not unload any media
  or libraries.
- This beta version of Joomla 5.4 is not suitable for production sites. It is for
  testing only.

- '401 Unauthorized: Check your credentials.'
