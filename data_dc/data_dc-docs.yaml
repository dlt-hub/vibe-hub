Based on the information provided from the documentation for the Data DC API source, here is the YAML configuration for the REST API source:

client:
  base_url: "https://api.data.dc.gov/v1/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"  # Authentication method used

resources:
  - name: "locations"
    endpoint: "/locations"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

  - name: "units"
    endpoint: "/units"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

  - name: "ssls"
    endpoint: "/ssls"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response

notes:
  - "The API does not support pagination, which may limit data retrieval capabilities in a single request."
  - "Ensure your API key is valid to avoid 401 Unauthorized errors."

errors:
  - 401  # Unauthorized
  - 403  # Forbidden
  - 429  # Too Many Requests

auth_info:
  mentioned_objects:
    - "API key requirements: Obtain an API key from https://dc.gov/."
    - "Authentication method: Pass the API key in the request header."

source_metadata:
  description: "The Data DC API provides access to data about geographical locations, units, and SSL certificates."
### Explanation of the YAML Configuration:
1. **Base URL**: Extracted directly from the documentation (`https://api.data.dc.gov/v1/`).
2. **Authentication Method**: Identified as "api_key" from the description.
3. **Resources**: Three primary endpoints: "locations", "units", and "ssls" were identified. Each has its endpoint and method (GET).
4. **Query Parameters**: No specific query parameters were mentioned in the documentation, so they are left blank.
5. **Notes**: Important notes about potential issues with pagination and API key validity were included.
6. **Errors**: Common error codes relevant to API interaction are listed.
7. **Auth Info**: Clarifies how to obtain the API key and the method for authentication.
8. **Source Metadata**: Provides a brief description of what the API offers.

This configuration serves as a complete and valid YAML specification for the Data DC REST API source.
