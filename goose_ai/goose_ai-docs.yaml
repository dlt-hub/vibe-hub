auth_info:
- information_source; https://goose.ai/docs:
  - API requests to GooseAI require a secret key for authentication. Generate a secret
    key from the API Key management page at https://goose.ai/dashboard/apikeys by
    clicking Create API Key. This secret key must be kept secure as usage incurs charges
    against your account and should be sent with requests to authenticate access to
    the GooseAI API.
- information_source; https://goose.ai/docs/api:
  - 'GooseAI API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer sk-*" where the token begins with "sk-". The
    API key should be obtained from your GooseAI account and passed in the request
    headers.'
- information_source; https://www.goose.ai/docs:
  - Users must generate a secret API key from the GooseAI Dashboard to access the
    API. The secret key should be kept secure as its usage incurs charges against
    the account balance. The documentation does not specify the exact header name
    or parameter name where this key should be sent in requests.
