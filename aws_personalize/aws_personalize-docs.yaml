auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/personalize/2018-05-22/openapi.json:
  - Amazon Personalize uses AWS Signature Version 4 signing for authentication. Requests
    must be signed using AWS access key ID and secret access key, with the signing
    name set to "personalize". This is the standard AWS request signing mechanism
    where credentials are used to generate an Authorization header along with other
    signature components like X-Amz-Date and X-Amz-Content-Sha256.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/personalize/2018-05-22/openapi.json:
  - Pagination uses a query parameter `maxResults` (optional, type string) to control
    the page size limit. The response includes a `nextToken` field for cursor-based
    pagination; pass this token in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
    An `InvalidNextTokenException` is thrown if an invalid token is provided.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based token approach with maxResults and nextToken query
    parameters. maxResults (optional, string) controls page size, and nextToken (optional,
    string) is used to request subsequent pages by passing the token from the previous
    response.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: maxResults (limit for number of results)
    and nextToken (token to retrieve the next page). The nextToken from the response
    should be passed in the subsequent request to continue pagination.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters nextToken (optional, continuation token) and
    maxResults (optional, controls page size). Use the nextToken value from the response
    to request the next page; stop when no nextToken is returned.
  - Use maxResults query parameter (optional) to set pagination limit and nextToken
    query parameter (optional) as a pagination token. Continue paginating by using
    the nextToken value from the response in subsequent requests until nextToken is
    absent.
