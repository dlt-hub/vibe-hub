- API is organized around 9 types of endpoints
- If you’re looking for your API key, you can find it in your profile settings at
  https://app.prontohq.com/settings/my_profile.
- Our API uses a credit-based system to manage usage. Different operations consume
  different amounts of credits.
- We enforce a daily profile extraction limit of 2,500 credits per account.
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Rate limits are applied per API key
- Each endpoint’s rate limit is tracked separately
- Different endpoint types have different rate limit windows
- Maximum of 5 requests can run in parallel
- Additional requests are automatically queued
- Requests are processed in order as slots become available
- No action required on your end to handle queuing
