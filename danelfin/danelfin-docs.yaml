auth_info:
- information_source; https://danelfin.com/docs/api:
  - The Danelfin API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the x-api-key
    header with your alphanumerical API key string. The API key is obtained by subscribing
    to an access plan on the Danelfin pricing page and will be sent via email. Keep
    the API key secure on your server and never expose it in client-side code.
