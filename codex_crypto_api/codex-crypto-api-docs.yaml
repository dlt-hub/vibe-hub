notes:
- You’ll need an account to make API requests.
- Sign up on the Codex Dashboard.
- Copy your API key from the API Keys page.
- Add the API key to your environment variables
- Usually these live in your .env file.
- All queries and mutations are sent over HTTPS, using the POST method.
- All websocket messages are sent over the wss protocol.
- WebSocket connections remain open indefinitely with no automatic server-side disconnection
- Connections require heartbeat messages to stay alive (handled automatically if using
  our SDK)
- Webhooks are sent via HTTP, and a 2xx response is expected within 3 seconds.
- Messages may be retried up to 2 times before giving up.
- filterTokens is limited to a maximum of 200 results per API call.
- Websocket requests are billed per message sent by the websocket, but we offer custom
  plans with discounts for high usage (10m+/month).
- Webhooks monitor one token at a time, but there is no limit to how many webhooks
  you can create.
errors:
- '401: Unauthorized: Check your API key'
- 'NOT_AUTHORIZED: Your API key was not found'
- Too many subscriptions may cause data to be dropped
- 'Failed: Usually a bad URL'
- '4401: Usually means that you’re trying to subscribe to a websocket before receiving
  confirmation that you’ve successfully connected to the server.'
