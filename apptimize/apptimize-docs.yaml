    `ApptimizeApiToken` header for all requests to the REST API endpoints.
  - 'Authentication uses an Apptimize API Token obtained from the dashboard''s Install
    page. The token must be included in the HTTP request header as ApptimizeApiToken:
    [API Token].'
- information_source; https://apptimize.com/docs/apis/roku-api.html:
  - Authentication is done via an Apptimize API Token, which is included in the Apptimize
    node configuration using the apiToken attribute. The API Token is obtained from
    the Install and Organization Details pages of the Apptimize dashboard and is distinct
    from the App Key used with Apptimize SDKs.
