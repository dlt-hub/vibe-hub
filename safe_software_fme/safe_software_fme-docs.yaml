  : - 'Most calls to FME Flow REST API require authorization using tokens. The API
      uses two token types: API Tokens for unauthenticated application access to components,
      and Session Tokens for user authentication. Tokens are encrypted strings sent
      between client and server. API Tokens can be created, managed, enabled, disabled,
      duplicated, or removed through the Token Management page. Tokens should be limited
      in permissions to minimize exposure risk if compromised.'
    - The FME Flow REST API uses token-based authentication. Tokens must be included
      in API requests to authorize access, and the documentation references token
      management as part of the authorization process. Specific details on token format,
      header names, and token acquisition methods are not provided in this excerpt.
    - Tokens are created via POST request to `http://<yourFMEFlowHost>/fmeapiv4/tokens`
      with a JSON body containing name, description, ownerID, enabled, customPermissions,
      and either secondsToExpiry or expiration (but not both). The API requires FME
      Flow user login credentials to authenticate the token creation request.

  : - 'Authentication uses a token-based scheme sent in the Authorization header.
      The header format is Authorization: fmetoken token=<your token value>, where
      you replace <your token value> with your actual FME Flow authentication token.'
    - Authentication uses a token-based scheme sent via the Authorization header.
      Include the header "Authorization" with the value "fmetoken token=<yourTOKEN>",
      replacing <yourTOKEN> with your actual token. Additionally, set Content-Type
      and Accept headers to "application/json".

  : - Pagination uses an offset parameter to control which records are fetched. The
      offset tells the API where to start fetching the next batch of records (for
      example the next 1000 records), and the response contains an "items" array with
      the paginated data.

  : - Pagination uses limit and offset query string parameters. The limit parameter
      controls the number of results per request, and offset specifies the starting
      position for retrieving the next batch of results.
