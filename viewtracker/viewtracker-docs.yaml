notes:
- Obtaining Viewtracker data from the above endpoints is only possible if authorization
  headers are sent with a valid token.
- Authentication of an existing token will no longer work if it is deleted or a new
  token is generated.
- The data of all reports can be exported or accessed via API.
- It can take up to 1 minute before the views are displayed in the reports.
- It may take up to 1 minute for recent views to appear in the report.
- Atlassian currently does not provide an API to read the exact storage space used
  in the space.
- It can take up to 1 minute before the views are displayed in the report.
- Once you’ve applied a filter or changed the report's date range, the report’s URL
  will adapt with parameters.
- It can take up to 1 minute before a recent view is displayed in the report.
- It can take up to 1 minute before recent views are displayed in the report.
- By default, the report only contains the file size of files that have been edited,
  viewed or attached since the Viewtracker app is active in your system.
- It may take up to 1 minute for views to be displayed in the report.
- It's impossible to track anonymous users accessing specific components via URLs.
  This is due to technical restrictions.
- Atlassian currently does not provide an API to read the exact storage space used
  on your instance.
- Currently, all reports list only spaces, content, attachments that have been viewed
  or edited since the Viewtracker installation.
- CSV files available for download in the Export Manager are secured with an authentication
  check.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The tracked Viewtracker data (views and viewers of pages, blog posts and attachments)
  can be migrated automatically using Atlassian's Migration Assistant.
- Some Server/DC macros are not available on Cloud.
- If 'Extended Privacy Mode' is selected in the Data Privacy setting, the user’s account
  ID will not be recorded and will therefore not be included in the exported CSV.
- Cloud apps cannot read usernames or full names because of data privacy regulations
  (GDPR).
- Protected Confluence users will not be counted as Viewers.
- If the Extended Privacy Mode is enabled, Viewtracker will not track individual users.
- If the page title is displayed as 'Protected Content', the user who created the
  export of a Viewtracker report is not allowed to view that information.
- It is also possible that a company has decided not to grant view permission to admins
  in the Viewtracker settings.
- Existing data for excluded spaces will remain in the database and will not be deleted.
- Confluence administrators will always have access to all Viewtracker reports.
- Viewtracker does not store user information apart from the user’s account ID (user
  ID).
- In the Extended Privacy Mode, the user ID is not tracked.
- Visitors using Scroll Viewport cannot log in to Confluence using their credentials.
  They are therefore counted as anonymous users.
- The Confluence Cloud API tells Viewtracker when content has been viewed, but not
  where it was viewed from. As a result, Viewtracker reports cannot currently be filtered
  by these sources.
- Only the Confluence admins can enable this feature.
- The stored CSV files will be available for 48 hours for download before being permanently
  deleted.
- Some macros, like the 'Popular Content' macro, are no longer supported and have
  been moved to 'Legacy macros'.

  to a dedicated group in Viewtracker's settings.
- The number of Content & Usage reports that can be generated simultaneously is limited.

- Users will appear in the table even if they have never made an interaction.
- Existing attachment views collected before the settings were changed will remain
  in the database and will not be deleted.

  Report.
- Tracking all the specific Confluence reports is disabled by default.

  not be tracked in any space.
- Previously collected data will remain visible in the reports. You will see the views
  and interactions of these users in the past, but no future interactions.
- Per default, all analytics data in Viewtracker is stored for all time.
- Limiting the time period may be useful for improving report performance and meeting
  data privacy regulations.
- Source tracking is not possible on Confluence Cloud due to technical differences.
- The filter only applies to page views. Edits, page versions etc are not affected
  by the filter, and the interactions will still appear in the graph.

  in the Confluence Cloud API.
- By default, Linchpin is tracked as a source.

- Viewtracker only counts page views and interactions starting on the day the app
  was installed on your instance.
- Any views before that will not appear on any report.
- This setting caches all Viewtracker reports for 10 minutes.
- This improves Confluence performance on sites with a lot of traffic.
- However, this means that the statistics in the reports will not be accurate during
  this time frame.
- All Viewtracker data is stored in the Confluence database.
- By default, every view is tracked since version 5.1.0.
- To track single pages, you need to insert the Viewtracker Macro on the page you

- If you add ?tracking=false to the URL of a Confluence page, the request is not tracked.
- bitvoodoo's Viewtracker is available for Cloud and Data Center.
- Analytics for Confluence is only available for Data Center and Cloud Premium & Enterprise.
- Viewtracker stores the data in the same way Confluence itself stores information
  about authors of pages and comments in the database.
- bitvoodoo ag is never an owner nor a processor of the data and can't access the
  data stored in the local Confluence database in any way.
- Batch inserting optimizes write operations by aggregating view data and storing
  it at one-minute intervals, rather than writing each view event individually as
  it occurs.
- Enabling the Cache statistics toggle delays the refresh of metrics displayed in
  various reports by 10 minutes.
- Data Retention allows administrators to specify the duration for which Viewtracker
  stores analytics data.
- The number of simultaneously created Content & Usage reports is limited to 4 by
  default.
- Viewtracker version 9.2.4 enables the setup of a read-only database.
- Built-in reports not working due to old jTDS Driver for Microsoft SQL Server DB
- What has been deleted cannot be restored! Proceed with caution and back up the table
  or the entire database beforehand.
- The database now doesn't allow any new insert as the new autoincremented number
  is too big for this datatype.
- This issue could be solved.
- Viewtracker doesn't display a graph on pages, and the built-in reporting doesn't
  display a graph.
- Sorting in the Reporting doesn't work as expected.
- In the Logging and profiling section of Confluence add the package "ch.bitvoodoo.confluence.plugins.viewtracker"
  to be logged and set the mode to "DEBUG".
- We recommend turning detailed logging off after i.e. finishing troubleshooting of
  an issue. DEBUG can be very verbose!
- Viewtracker DC customers see only Viewtracker data by default.
- Using both apps might impair Confluence's overall performance.
- This action will remove the page view counter from all pages in your instance.
- The tracking will still work.
- The incoming request has too many parameters. The server supports a maximum of 2100
  parameters. Reduce the number of parameters and resend the request.
- Define more specific CQL in the filter.
- The error is specific for the MSSQL database.
- Compatible with the Default Viewport templates. Extra modifications might be needed
  for new templates.

- The output will comply with permissions set in Viewtracker’s Data Privacy setting
  and in the general Confluence space and content permission.

  on newer instances.
- The report is expanded by default. Check this box if the report should be collapsed
  by default.

- This documentation is not maintained. We advise using the built-in Viewtracker reports
  or the Viewtracker API instead of using 3rd-party apps.
- We do not offer support for custom-configured Space Usage Reports.
