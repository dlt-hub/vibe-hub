auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.endicia.com/developer/docs/els.html:
  - Credentials are passed in the SOAP request body within the CertifiedIntermediary
    element using AccountID, PassPhrase, Token, and TokenTimeStamp fields. The Token
    and TokenTimeStamp are used together for authentication, while PassPhrase serves
    as a secondary credential along with AccountID.
  - 'Credentials are passed in the SOAP request body within the CertifiedIntermediary
    element using three fields: AccountID (string), PassPhrase (string), and Token
    (string). Additionally, a RequesterID is required in the request body.'
  - 'Endicia Label Server uses one of two authentication methods in requests: either
    AccountID and PassPhrase together, or a Token alone. Set TokenRequested to true
    when calling ChangePassPhrase to receive a Token, which should be included in
    subsequent API requests instead of AccountID and PassPhrase. These credentials
    are passed as XML elements in the SOAP request body, and you cannot use all three
    (AccountID, PassPhrase, Token) simultaneously in the same request.'
  - ID (Partner ID) uniquely identifies the system making the request and is assigned
    by Endicia. This ID must be included in requests to authenticate the partner system.
    RequestID is a unique identifier for each request that will be returned in the
    response.
  - 'The API requires authentication through two fields in the request: RequesterID
    and CertifiedIntermediary. The CertifiedIntermediary element must contain an AccountID
    and PassPhrase, which serve as credentials to authenticate the request. These
    values should be included in the XML request body alongside the RequesterID parameter.'
