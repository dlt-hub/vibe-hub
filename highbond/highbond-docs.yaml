auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs-apis.highbond.com/:
  - API requests require a bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Use the
    Authorization header with the value "Bearer {token}" where {token} is your authentication
    token obtained through the bearerToken authentication method.
  - Add users to a Results collection member using bearer token authentication. Include
    the bearer token in the Authorization header.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs-apis.highbond.com/:
  - Pagination is present in the response structure. The API uses link-based pagination
    with a "next" field in the "links" object containing the URL for the next page
    (for example "/api/resource?page[number]=Mg=="). The "prev" field indicates the
    previous page URL or null when not available. To paginate, use the next URL from
    the response until next is null, indicating the last page.
  - Pagination uses offset and usersPerPage query parameters. The response includes
    a total field indicating the total number of results. Use offset to specify the
    starting position and usersPerPage to control results per page.
  - Pagination uses page[number] query parameter with base64-encoded values. The response
    includes a links object with next and prev fields containing the full pagination
    URLs; use the next URL to fetch the next page, and stop when next is null.
  - Pagination uses query parameter page[number] (URL-encoded as page%5Bnumber%5D)
    to request specific pages. Response includes links.next containing the URL for
    the next page and links.prev for the previous page, with null indicating no available
    page in that direction.
  - Pagination uses query parameter page[number] in the request URL to specify the
    page, with response containing next and prev fields as full URLs to navigate to
    subsequent or previous pages, or null when unavailable.
