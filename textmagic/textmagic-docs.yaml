pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.textmagic.com/:
  - The TextMagic SMS API uses limit-based pagination for endpoints that return resource
    arrays. The limit parameter accepts values between 1 and 100, with a default value
    of 10. However, the documentation does not specify request parameters for navigating
    pages, response fields indicating pagination state, or how to construct subsequent
    requests.
  - Use query parameters page (integer, default 1) and limit (integer, default 10)
    to paginate results. The response includes a pager field indicating the current
    page number.
