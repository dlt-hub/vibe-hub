notes:
- 'API Key format as: {NETWORK}:{KEY}'
- Be aware of and respect rate limits to avoid service disruptions.
- ORA provides chain-agnostic infrastructure that bridges the gap between AI and blockchain.
- $ORA token is central to the ORA ecosystem, serving multiple roles including governance
  and access to IMOs.
- $ORA's utility includes access to IMO, node operations, governance, and more.
- Earn $ORA by contributing liquidity to Axons, powering the neural pathways of World
  Intelligence and contributing real value to the ecosystem.
- Rewards are calculated and distributed daily at 00:00 UTC.
- ORA’s tokenomics are currently supported on Ethereum, Base, and BNBChain, with plans
  to expand to all networks where $ORA is available.
- After initiating a withdrawal request, you need to manually claim your withdrawal
  after the 33-day waiting period via our frontend interface.
- To earn $ORA rewards, you must interact through our tokenomics contracts. It’s recommended
  to use our frontend for this purpose.
- Claiming your rewards and adding them back into the pool will compound your rewards.
- Once a withdrawal is requested, the requested amount stops receiving $ORA emission
  rewards. However, you will continue to earn standard LP fees.
- AI Oracle is powered by Optimistic Machine Learning (opML).
- It enables a verifiable, transparent, and decentralized way to integrate advanced
  ML models like LLaMA 3 and Stable Diffusion into smart contracts.
- Each opAgent is created by an onchain genesis transaction.
- Every opAgent manages its digital assets via smart contract wallets.
- RMS will support DeFAI by providing AI services like automated trading strategies,
  risk management, and personal financial agent, all verifiable and decentralized.
- ORA's AI Oracle is designed with decentralization at its core.
- Prices are measured in unit of $ORA.
- RMS is part of ORA’s commitment to providing decentralized, verifiable AI solutions.
- RMS is built on the foundation of opML (Optimistic Machine Learning), a pioneering
  approach by ORA that integrates the verifiability, decentralization, and resilience
  of blockchain technology with computation of AI.
- 'N-to-M Model: Unlike centralized services, RMS scales by distributing load across
  many providers, potentially offering better performance during peak times.'
- 'Cost-Effectiveness: Decentralized resources can be cheaper than centralized cloud
  services, with efficient use of decentralized GPUs or CPUs.'
- Participants deposit $ORA tokens into the IMO proposal of their choice.
- Once deposited, $ORA is locked until the raising period finishes.
- Initial Model Offering tokenizes AI models onchain.
- Participants can capture a percentage of fees incurred during model inference.
- ERC-7641 allows token holders to claim and redeem a proportional share of a communal
  revenue pool.
- The burning mechanism reduces total token supply over time.
- ERC-7007 is a token standard that enables the creation and management of NFTs representing
  AI-generated content.
- Regular World Supercomputer Summits are held.
- Check out the recaps.
- ORA ensures that every IMO launch is decentralized and transparent, requiring $ORA
  as the primary deposit for allocation.
- Participants can deposit $ORA into multiple proposals. Each deposit is managed independently
  based on the outcome of the respective proposal.
- Allows token holders to claim and redeem a proportional share of a communal revenue
  pool.
- Supports an optional extension for revenue sharing with alternative ERC-20 tokens.
- RMS provides computation for all scenarios, ensuring resilient AI computation.
- API service allows developers to call upon most popular AI models for AI inference.
- ERC-7007 enables verification of AI-generated content.
- Standardizes NFT representation for AI-generated content.
- AI Oracle is ORA's verifiable and decentralized AI oracle, enabling developers to
  integrate AI functionalities into their smart contracts seamlessly.
