notes:
- API tokens provide full access to your Infrahub instance. Store them securely and
  never commit them to version control.
- Artifact definitions appear in the web interface
- Artifacts are generated for all group members
- Generated content matches your template expectations
- Artifacts update when source data changes
- Store the token in a secure location, as there will be no way to retrieve the token
  from Infrahub at a later stage.
- You might have to change the X-INFRAHUB-KEY header value to the API token of your
  user, if you are not using the default.
- The models available on Peering Manager can be found in the /api of your instance.
- The Authentication Token must be provided in a header named X-INFRAHUB-KEY
errors:
- 'Invalid Infrahub address: Check the URL format and network connectivity'
- 'Authentication errors: Verify your API token is valid and has necessary permissions'
- 'Connection timeouts: Increase timeout values for slow networks'
- Check task worker logs for processing errors
- Verify the transformation name matches exactly
- Ensure group members inherit from CoreArtifactTarget
- Confirm the Git repository sync is working
