auth_info:
- information_source; https://simkl.docs.apiary.io/:
  - 'Authorization is via Bearer token in the Authorization header and a client ID
    in the simkl-api-key header. The Bearer token is obtained through OAuth2 authentication
    and should be included as "Authorization: Bearer [token]" in requests. The simkl-api-key
    header must contain the client_id value. Both are required to access protected
    endpoints like /sync/all-items/ and /sync/activities.'
  - Authorization requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header and a
    client_id passed in the simkl-api-key header. Both are required for requests to
    the sync endpoints.
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header and
    requires the simkl-api-key header with a client_id value. Both the Authorization
    header with format "Bearer [token]" and the simkl-api-key header must be included
    in all requests to the sync endpoints.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer [token] header is required. The token should be included
    in the Authorization header with the "Bearer" scheme for API requests to Simkl
    endpoints.'
  - Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header and API key authentication
    via the simkl-api-key header. Both credentials must be included in requests to
    the API endpoints.
