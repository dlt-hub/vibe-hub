notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- It is recommended to choose the SAML integration.
- Ensure that your IdP passes the `groups` attribute that is sent in the SAML Assertion.
- Only admins are granted access to configure EDP settings in Finout.
- Users can define only a single EDP Tag for each account.
- Finout adopts AWS’s cost dataset terminology as a standard, ensuring consistency
  in cost language across all providers and services.
- The Optimize documentation in Finout provides comprehensive guidance on reducing
  cloud costs and improving resource efficiency.
- Ensure proper OAuth2 token management for seamless API access.
- Access control list (ACL) in the roadmap for future release.
- Dimension Sets are customizable and can be created and managed by a platform administrator.
- Users can easily switch to view all available dimensions at any time by clicking
  'All'.
- All application objects remain unchanged and, when opened, will automatically switch
  to the 'All' view to display their complete properties and ensure all dimensions
  are visible.
- Cost data in MegaBill is available for all cloud providers and services supported
  by Finout.
- Usage data is available for AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- You can refine your view with more granular control using advanced operators.
- The default time frame is the last 30 days.
- Event annotation is enabled by default
- You can hide annotations by clicking it off
- Tracking EBS status allows monitoring changes over time.
- Volumes continue to incur charges until deleted or attached to another instance.
- Deleting a view will remove it for all users in the account.
- A Virtual Tag is active from the current period onwards.
- The number of rules allowed in a virtual tag is 50.
- Only Admins can create a financial plan.
- Financial plans support up to 1000 line items.
- Only an Admin can bulk upload.
- The download will only show what is in the current view. You can filter the view
  to customize the downloaded CSV file.
- The values uploaded in the CSV file will override any existing budgets and forecast
  values. Cost and delta values are not updated.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The Normalized Storage column only returns values when GB-Mo is selected as the
  unit. If any other unit is used, the column will display 0.
- CostGuard provides a comprehensive solution that is seamlessly integrated with the
  MegaBill.
- The CostGuard feature is available out of the box and generally requires no configuration.
- The resource status can be managed to track progress.
- As of now, this feature supports AWS Reserved Instance commitment types.
- AWS calculates savings per commitment yearly, whereas Finout provides savings per
  commitment calculations on a daily level.
- RIs will automatically appear from your primary AWS account in the Commitment Log.
- Finout automatically filters out taxes, credits, and promotions from anomaly detection
  to reduce noise and highlight only operationally significant changes.
- A maximum number of anomalies with the highest cost changes will be sent as alerts
  to your endpoint each day, with a maximum of 150 alerts a day.
- Currently, daily seasonality is supported for an evaluation period of 1 to 6 days.
- An alert is triggered only if the cost exceeds the expected range based on your
  alert settings.
- Creating anomalies for new virtual tags is enabled for all accounts by default.
- Pre-defined anomalies can be customized to suit your needs.
- When you modify a predefined anomaly, a new custom anomaly is created with the revised
  settings, and the original predefined anomaly is deactivated.
- Enables sending reports to endpoints based on group-by values, filtered accordingly.
- If no specific endpoint is set per value, the report will be sent filtered by that
  value to the default endpoint when set.
- Tag governance ensures consistent and effective resource management across cloud
  environments.
- The Untagged Resources policy type does not detect resources labeled as 'untagged'
  within Virtual Tags.
- The file should list all approved values in a single column, one per row, without
  headers.
- The values uploaded in the CSV file will override existing ones.
- Policy type is not editable after creation.
- You can add up to 5 columns.
- 'Note: "displayName" is retrieved in the GET API call. This parameter should not
  be sent in the POST/PUT API calls.'
- Telemetry-based and relational virtual tag allocations support up to 10,000 values
  each.
- Currently, using virtual tag values metadata is only available in Financial Plans.
- Adding virtual tag metadata using the PUT query overrides the current data in the
  virtual tag.
