notes:
- Uses ClimateBERT for text classification of climate commitments
- Model performance evaluated with precision, recall, and F1 score
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Model performance is evaluated on the basis of precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Uses ChatGPT to extract metadata values from text snippets.
- Implemented parameter to ensure responses are JSON objects.
- Performance results suggest high application accuracy on labeling and extraction
  tasks.
- The development of AI/ML-enabled data collection tools is particularly advantageous
  when structured datasets are not readily available and/or when processing of large
  volumes of data.
- Standardized data formatting imposed using AI/ML tools can facilitate linkages to
  complementary datasets, allowing for deeper analysis based on more comprehensive
  information.
- Particularly in the case of NLP models, AI/ML tools can be continuously retrained
  and adapted to different information collection tasks, efficiently integrating new
  information into data pipelines without incurring large computing costs or expending
  significant analyst resources.
- Refining the list of key words used to web scrape search results from PDB websites
  by evaluating the effectiveness of each individual key word set, assessing which
  most effectively retrieve validated commitments.
- The classification model is trained on a rebalanced dataset containing a 50-50 split
  between labeled commitments and non-commitments.
- Utilizes ChatGPT for metadata extraction from commitments
- Cost-saving strategy reduced token usage by ~78%
- API cost can change overtime as well as become depreciated, so we recommend reviewing
  available models for the scale of your tasks
