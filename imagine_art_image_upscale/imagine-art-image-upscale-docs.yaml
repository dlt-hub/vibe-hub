notes:
- DRF handles the entire pagination logic automatically!
- If an endpoint supports the per_page query parameter, you can control how many results
  are returned on a page.
- OAuth2 authentication is becoming extremely popular for the simple fact that it
  supports many different ways (flows) to authenticate to the same endpoint(s).
- Pagination significantly enhances performance by allowing data to be retrieved and
  processed in smaller, manageable chunks.
- By fetching subsets of data rather than the entire dataset, pagination decreases
  the memory, processing power, and bandwidth required for data handling.
- Efficient caching can optimize repeated API requests, especially for static or infrequently
  changing datasets.
- Use cache headers like ETag and Last-Modified to minimize server load and improve
  client performance.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Pagination is a crucial concept that needs to be understood and designed into a
  REST API before its built.
- If the next response returns data, it will give a 200 OK response and they can show
  the data.
- If there is no data then it will still be a 200 OK but there is an empty array,
  showing that everything was fine, but there is no data on that page right now.
- Using links instead of putting metadata in the response allows for more flexibility
  over time with little-to-no impact on clients.
