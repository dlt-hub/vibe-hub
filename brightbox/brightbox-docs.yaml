notes:
- API requires authorization using OAuth2 tokens.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Volumes are replicated in real time across 3 separate storage servers for high availability,
  so that there are always 3 copies of your data.
- Volumes enable you to add additional storage to your Cloud Servers without needing
  to upgrade RAM and CPU at the same time.
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access control lists can be used to control access
- Brightbox load balancers can be created and updated instantly through the Brightbox
  Manager web app, the CLI or REST API.
- Monthly prices are approximate and displayed for convenience. USD and EUR amounts
  are estimates based on currency exchange rates. Windows® Server licensing, if required,
  is available for €60.34 per month
- Monthly prices are approximate and displayed for convenience.
- USD and EUR amounts are estimates based on currency exchange rates.
- We provide 24/7 emergency support for critical issues affecting production systems.
- We’ll set you and your team up on our managed support system where tickets can be
  created and escalated where necessary.
- Uses network storage types can be resized to a smaller size.
- Ensure to unmount volumes before detaching to avoid data loss.
- Use 'lsblk -f' to confirm mounted filesystems.
- Firewall Rules are added to a Firewall Policy, rather than directly onto a Server
  Group.
- The direction of a rule depends on whether you set the source address or the destination
  address.
- It’s easy to mis-configure something and render one of your servers inaccessible
  or unbootable.
- User data cannot be larger than 16k in size.
- cloud-init is a tool preinstalled on Ubuntu images that runs on first boot
- Users can control cloud-init behavior with user data
- Uploaded images and snapshot images are private by default.
- Cloud IPs are publicly routed IP addresses that can be instantly mapped to Cloud
  Servers, Load Balancers or Cloud SQL instances.
- Cloud IPs are dual-stack and have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- It's important that you set up the forward mapping first, requests to set up a reverse
  DNS entry will fail if the corresponding forward DNS entry is missing.
- Contact details for sales and general enquiries.
- Sign up requires a valid credit or debit card.
- Update Brightbox REST API to v1.58.0
- Fix to ensure `deleted_at` is set correctly for some resources.
- Performance improvement for S3 emulation.
- Some API operations may have changed names for standardisation.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- Collaborators can manage resources but cannot access billing details.
- An Image (or Cloud Server Image) is a copy of a virtual disk from which a Cloud
  Server can be built.
- Both uploaded images and snapshot images are private by default.
- An Image with the attribute official set to true has been provided by Brightbox.
- Cloud IPs can be mapped to any server belonging to the same account.
- DNS updates for Cloud IP mappings can take time to propagate due to caching.
- Snapshots are limited to a maximum disk_size of 50GB.
- The system aborts snapshot requests that try to create images bigger than that.
- Due to the way OAuth authentication works, any sessions authenticated before you
  deleted an API Client can be valid for up to 2 hours.
- Users have read and write access to Orbit containers by default.
- Repositories can also be made public which allows anyone to pull images.
- Terraform manifests automatically deploy the Brightbox Kubernetes cluster autoscaler.
- Worker nodes built by terraform are static; those built by the autoscaler are dynamic.
- Recommand against storing user credentials on-disk in plain-text.
- Uses a Load Balancer with health checks
- Supports SSL with Let's Encrypt
- Terraform authenticates with Brightbox using your username and password or API Client
  credentials.
- Cloud Server usage is billed by the hour according to the Server Type.
- Cloud Servers created with local storage Server Types are billable when in both
  active and inactive state.
- Reverse DNS for private addresses works from within the Brightbox cloud network.
- Custom reverse DNS settings require forward DNS mapping to be in place.
- Load Balancers require a Cloud IP to be reachable and support both IPv4 and IPv6.
- Snapshots of MySQL instances are compatible between point releases but not between
  minor versions.
- The snapshot process depends on crash recoverable storage engines.
- If you encounter an error or believe there is a problem with our systems please
  do let us know
- Cloud SQL Instances can only be resized to a larger type and the resize process
  can't be undone later.
- Following a successful resize the increased vCPU and local SSD allocations are usable
  straightaway, but the instance will need to be restarted to tune MySQL or PostgreSQL
  to fully use the new RAM allocation.
