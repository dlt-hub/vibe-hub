notes:
- Lack of authentication returns a ‘not found’ error rather than ‘denied’.
- This API requires an API key and credential for authentication.
- Multiple files can be uploaded with the same item, with extra metadata required
  for each file.
- Creating a site requires several fields (iirc slug, title and theme)
- Creating a page requires several values to be provided (title, slug, site)
- A page slug uses the very restrictive set of 09azAZ-_
- This release brings official support for PHP 8.4, and at the same time moves up
  the minimum required version to 7.1.
- There are a variety of updates, improvements, and fixes in this version including
  enhanced support for S3 storage, improvements to performance, security, and more.
- Due to an overwhelming amount of spam posts in the last couple of days, we have
  paused the ability to create new user accounts.
- Users can subscribe to receive news about Omeka Classic and Omeka S.
- Install this version in a development site, not one that is live for production.
- The current method of page building by stacking of individual blocks in a page,
  which we’ve come to call “Normal flow”, will continue to be available for users
  who like to work that way.
- Grid uses the native CSS grid feature to provide users with more tools for positioning
  their content the way they want without needing custom theming or CSS skills.
- Block developers can still add additional settings for their individual blocks,
  but these will be consistently available.
- This is not yet the final 4.0.0 release, so it’s not intended to be used for a production
  site.
- Modules must be updated and indicate support for the new version.
- Most modules and themes will need to be updated when you upgrade to version 2.0.
- Includes support for detecting reverse proxies and generating correct https links.
- Security fixes for CSRF and XSS issues
- Miscellaneous fixes, including bundling of updated plugins
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Omeka
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses drag-n-drop editing content from a set of predefined templates
- ImageMagick is software that’s usually on servers, but not always.
- It’s not part of Omeka, but is something that by default we use.
- This sounds like it’s probably a shortcoming with the WYSIWYG editor we’re using
  (since the HTML Filtering settings didn’t have an effect).
- You can change these in admin/themes/default/javascripts/globals.js (the initParams
  in the Omeka.wysiwyg function).
- To make sure we’re just looking at TinyMCE here, do you have the HTML filtering
  disabled in Settings -> Security?
- Ensure that the PDO MySQL driver is installed on the server.
- Check that the database credentials are correct.
- You need to install susy to build the Sass.
- Removing the ../../ fixed the import issue.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Omeka Classic is designed for a single site around a general theme.
- Omeka S was created for institutions managing a sharable resource pool across multiple
  sites.
- 'Imagemagick and imagick are not the same library: imagemagick uses the command
  line, but imagick is integrated to php.'
- Uses Transifex for translations of Omeka S.
- The `upload.maxFileSize` limit in Omeka’s application/config/config.ini is only
  useful for decreasing the limit, not for increasing it.
- The php.ini setting `upload_max_filesize` is a limit set by PHP that constrains
  the maximum size of any one file.
- The php.ini setting `post_max_size` is a limit set by PHP that constrains the maximum
  total amount of data that can be sent in any one request.
- The maximum file size you’re allowed to upload is visible near the file upload input.
- Omeka S 4.0.0 added support for ingesting and displaying IIIF presentation manifests
  as media.
- Ensure to build the select options carefully to avoid duplicates.
- Consider hard-coding options if they do not change frequently.
- Local paths are forbidden for security. They may be allowed for a specific directory
  in my fork Csv Import Plus.
- Omeka is designed for a lamp stack, and I don’t see Windows since a long while,
  so I can’t check it.
- Requires user registration for access to public content.
- Users must agree to Terms & Conditions before viewing content.
- The API already provides an internal persistent URL for an item at the `api/default`
  route.
- Content negotiation will be implemented on the Omeka side.
- SEO would be better served by having one site as the root.
- In the global settings for your Omeka S installation, there is an option for 'default
  site' where you can select from a dropdown of all sites in the installation to set
  what people see when they go to the front page of the installation.
- Omeka S is based on a central unique repository for all items, but on multiple sites.
- Items can be public or private; private items are hidden to visitors.
- The ImageMagick directory path does not work.
- 'The simplest option should be: install ImageMagick from the installer.'
- allow_url_fopen can be used to retrieve data from remote servers or websites.
- mysqlnd => enabled
- Compression => supported
- core SSL => supported
- extended SSL => supported
- Restrict to templates option available in site settings for advanced search.
- The problem is intermittent–some times it saves but mostly it doesn’t.
- Uses HTML Filtering settings under Settings -> Security to allow 'img' and its attributes.
- Ensure mod_rewrite module is installed and activated.
- Check Apache error log for issues.
- Enable mod_rewrite by using 'sudo a2enmod rewrite'
- Modify apache2.conf to include 'RewriteEngine On'
- Change 'AllowOverride None' to 'AllowOverride All' in the default site configuration
- Core functionality does not support item duplication; a plugin may be required.
- Some people have modules and themes that are helpful for multilingual support.
- 'ImageMagick error: invalid ImageMagick command.'
- Setting imagemagick_dir to NULL allows creating thumbnails from JPGs but not from
  PDFs or Films.
- Rebuilding the native ImageMagick is recommended over building from source.
- 'ImageMagick looks for the delegate configuration file in the following order: /usr/local/share/ImageMagick/delegates.mgk,
  DELEGATE_PATH/delegates.mgk, HOME/.magick/delegates.mgk, ./delegates.mgk'
- Some policies are set to 'none' for specific patterns to avoid issues.
- The API is exposed as a REST API which you can interact with in whatever form you
  want.
- Use the REST API to create items.
- The error is just about size. Can you confirm that the “System information” link
  at the footer of the Omeka S admin pages reflects your set POST size?
- You can upload files (media) in the same request as the item, or a different one.
- The documentation was wrong regarding the context names.
- Use the name of the Element Set that’s given in the Admin->Settings->Element Sets
  page.
- Ensure correct path settings in config.ini for imports to work.
- The process may hang if errors are not caught early.
- The problem lies with the jQuery plugin used for managing themes’ navigation.
- The issue appears on touch-enabled devices.
- The widget is automatically added to the theme to simplify the work of the theme
  designer.
- If the template file is not present in your theme directory, Omeka takes the default
  one inside application/view/.
- Deactivating CuratescapeJSON did the trick.
- POST request exceeded maximum size error occurs on Red Hat when running dockerised
  Omeka-S.
- Error may be related to PHP post_max_size setting.
- Changes in the _getForm method in the UserController.php file will probably make
  those changes possible.
- You might have to do some Zend trickery to modify the form text and add the checkbox.
- 3.2 includes a fix for servers that are set up to not periodically purge the old
  sessions, so this shouldn’t be a significant problem going forward.
- Items have lost their images while metadata is still visible.
- The language setting fails in combination with data types created by Numeric Data
  Type and Data Type RDF modules.
- In module Numeric Data Types, a numeric data type cannot have a language.
- Includes options for zoom/unzoom/full screen icons in the D3 block.
- You can choose 'Internal ID' for item sets, or use Title or Identifier properties.
- Requires setup of connected app in Omeka S
- Some properties may return null for specific configurations
- Losing the Advanced Search option altogether is odd since it should appear without
  AvantSearch being activated.
- This plugin adds a button to the admin Tags view enabling batch-deletion of tags
  that are not associated with any records.
- This might happen if you deleted an element that your contribution form is configured
  to ask for.
- Active page not set when Clean URL is active
- Upgrading to v2 drops the mapping_marker table.
- Ensure CSV files are saved in UTF-8 format.
- Check logs for more detailed error reporting.
- 'InvalidArgumentException: Invalid record passed to recordMetadata. This may indicate
  a bug in the software'
- You can either install a file on your root directory or submit a sitemap.
- After PHP 8.3 upgrade, extra blank line in output causes XML parsing errors.
- Access is designed to check accesses to files, not to the item records.
- Easy Admin loads modules from the original sources, so mainly from Github and Gitlab.
- The module, neither Omeka, does not have option to manage a proxy for now.
- Browsers generally can’t display TIFFs, so when you get down to the link to the
  original file, they’re going to download them.
- Omeka S has a flat data model — Hierarchy module allows for nested relationships
  among Item Sets.
- Selecting 'None' for 'Add identifier for global repository' still adds a system
  identifier.
- You can extend a block class like that, yes.
- There isn’t really a similar concept for the layout file.
- The platform is called Ibali (isiXhosa for story) and can be found at https://ibali.uct.ac.za
- A PHP setting sends caching headers, which need to be changed.
- You can create pages that are constructed with various block elements.
- Omeka S does not allow metadata values to include HTML.
- 'To use HTML, Omeka S has a couple different options: HTML Media and HTML Blocks
  for sites.'
- If the tps and .com are missing, it’s because the forum prevents me from putting
  internet links in my post.
- The JSON data of an item does not contain the label of the resource template.
- Users struggle with migrating settings for Sites, Pages, Navigation, Theme.
- Some users suggest exporting/importing database as a whole.
- This looks like it’s a limitation of the library we use to make that gallery display,
  but they appear to have added support for setting alt attributes on the thumbnails
  in a later version.
- It seems that UV is looking for images at the wrong path, but I can not find any
  configuration settings in UV, IIIFImageServer or in ImageServer module to configure
  that.
- Strange - if I click on “full screen” it shows that image. I thought that it is
  browser related but it happens in Chrome and in Firefox the same.
- A common practice I also do is to add ?rel=0 to an embedded video URL to prevent
  suggested videos from displaying at the end.
- Support by the gallery library we use isn’t great for audio, it basically treats
  it the same way it does video.
- The text content of HTML media is included in the fulltext search index, since version
  4.1.0.
- HTML Purifier is not the root of the problem.
- CKEditor may modify HTML in a non-configurable way.
