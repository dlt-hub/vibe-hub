auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.next.id/faq:
  - The API requires ECDSA signatures using secp256k1 keys for authentication. Signatures
    must be generated using the Ethereum Personal Sign method and submitted with POST
    requests to /v1/proof. The signature payload must include created_at and uuid
    parameters obtained from the /v1/proof/payload endpoint, and the public key should
    be in compressed format (33 bytes, starting with 0x02 or 0x03).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.next.id/rest-api/proofservice-api:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameter page (number, starting at 1 for the first
    page). No response fields indicating pagination state or how to determine when
    to stop paginating are described in the provided documentation.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with a page parameter (query string, optional,
    first page is 1). The response includes a pagination object with total (total
    results), per (results per page), current (current page number), and next (next
    page number, or 0 if on last page). To paginate, increment the page parameter
    in subsequent requests until next equals 0.
  - The response includes pagination metadata with total (total number of items),
    per (items per page, default 20), current (current page number), and next (next
    page number, where 0 indicates no more pages). Use the next value to determine
    if additional pages exist and construct subsequent requests accordingly.
  - page is an optional query parameter (number type) for pagination. Additional pagination
    details are not provided in this excerpt.
