notes:
- Tokens are valid for about 1 hour and after that one has to get a new one.
- FHIR support is in pre-release state. There may be errors in the results and the
  API parameters and behaviour may change in the next releases
- ICD content at the test location might not be up to date or complete. For production,
  use the API located at id.who.int with proper OAUTH authentication.
- The API located at https://id.who.int requires OAUTH authentication.
- Manual binding is recommended when ECT is used in a JavaScript framework. Binding
  the ECT only after the framework has mounted the component is safer.
- Docker image contains ARM processor support.
- Container can work without access to the Internet after initial setup.
- By default the API runs at port 8382.
- DORIS functionality is in pre-release state and not enabled by default.
- IMPORTANT! Please note that in earlier releases we were using port 6382 which has
  changed to 8382 in this release.
- DORIS (Underlying cause of death detection) functionality is in pre-release state.
  For this reason it is not enabled by default.
