notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The prefix CELERY_ must be added to the names of the environment variables described.
- This module is the main entry-point for the Celery API.
- The prefix `CELERY_` must be added to the names of the environment variables described
  below.
- Long-standing disconnection issues with the Redis broker have been identified and
  resolved in Kombu 5.5.0.
- Soft shutdown is a time limited warm shutdown, initiated just before the cold shutdown.
- Long-standing disconnection issues with the Redis broker have been identified and
  resolved in Kombu 5.5.0, which is included with this release.
- The Redis backend now has better exception handling with the new exception_safe_to_retry
  feature, which improves resilience during temporary Redis connection issues.
- New native support for Pydantic models in tasks.
- Official support for Python 3.13.
- Celery v5.5.0 Release Candidate 5 is now available for testing.
- The soft shutdown is a new mechanism in Celery that sits between the warm shutdown
  and the cold shutdown.
- After upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the quorum queues
  support.
- After upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Google Pub/Sub
  transport support.
- After upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown
  mechanism.
- After upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic
  support.
- After upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker
  stability.
- The soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new
  configuration option [`worker_soft_shutdown_timeout`](userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout).
- If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip
  the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new
  configuration option [`worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle`](userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle)
  is set to True.
- 5.2 is codenamed dawn-chorus.
- The default serializer is now JSON to address security concerns.
- Running Celery services as an unprivileged user is recommended.
- Uses cache framework for locking
- Requires atomic add operation in cache backend
- Tasks used within a chord must not ignore their results. In practice this means
  that you must enable a result_backend in order to use chords.
- Chords don’t properly work with Redis before version 2.2; you’ll need to upgrade
  to at least redis-server 2.2 to use them.
- Added in version 2.0.
- Added in version 3.0.
- Tasks used within a chord must not ignore their results.
- Chords are not currently supported with the RPC result backend.
- The callback must be linked to the signature before stamping.
- For development docs, go to https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/main/userguide/canvas.html.
- Tasks used within a chord must not ignore their results. If the result backend is
  disabled for any task in your chord you should read the important notes.
- This documentation covers the design of workflows in Canvas.
- Alternate routing concepts like topic and fanout is not available for all transports,
  please consult the transport comparison table.
- Multiple bindings to a single queue are supported.
- It is considered best practice to not hard-code routing settings.
- To receive broadcast remote control commands, every worker node creates a unique
  queue name, based on the nodename of the worker.
- If you have more than one worker with the same host name, the control commands will
  be received in round-robin between them.
- Disabling the prefetch limits is possible, but that means the worker will consume
  as many tasks as it can, as fast as possible.
- Uses retry for Python errors, and if your task is idempotent combine that with acks_late
  if that level of reliability is required.
- Using distant eta times is not recommended, and in such case periodic tasks should
  be preferred.
- You should never stop the worker with the KILL signal unless you've tried TERM a
  few times.
- Default time in seconds before a retry of the task should be executed. 3 minutes
  by default.
- If enabled the worker won’t store task state and return values for this task. Defaults
  to the task_ignore_result setting.
- When called tasks apply the run() method. This method must be defined by all tasks
  (that is unless the __call__() method is overridden).
- Maximum number of retries before giving up. If set to None, it will never stop retrying.
- Default task priority is None
- Rate limit can be None, ‘100/s’, ‘100/m’, or ‘100/h’
- Enabling reject_on_worker_lost can cause message loops
- Max length of result representation used in logs and events is 1024
- If enabled, the task will report its status as ‘started’ when executed by a worker
- If enabled, the request will keep track of subtasks started by this task
- Max size of positional argument representation used for logging purposes. Default
  is 1024.
- Max size of keyword argument representation used for logging purposes. Default is
  1024.
- Registry of available tasks.
- Crontab can be used for scheduling periodic tasks.
- Parser for Crontab expressions is available.
- Message Signing Serializer
- Set of built-in task states.
- In order to abort tasks, there needs to be communication between the producer and
  the consumer.
- Sphinx documentation plugin used to document tasks.
- Hostname to bind to. Default is ‘127.0.0.1’ (only accessible from localhost).
- Base port to bind to. Default is 6899.
- Events is a stream of messages sent for certain actions occurring in the worker.
- 'An event is simply a dictionary: the only required field is `type`.'
- A `timestamp` field will be set to the current time if not provided.
- The periodic task scheduler.
- Scheduler backed by shelve database.
- Pidfiles and logfiles are stored in the current directory by default.
- This document describes the current stable version of Celery (5.5).
