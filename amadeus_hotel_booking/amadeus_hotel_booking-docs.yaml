auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/flights/api-doc/flight-offers-price/api-reference:
  - To use this API, you need an access token obtained through the Authorization Guide
    referenced in the documentation. The documentation states "Before using this API,
    we recommend you read our Authorization Guide for more information on how to generate
    an access token." However, the specific details about how to pass the access token
    (header name, parameter name, or other mechanism) are not provided in this excerpt.
    You must consult the Authorization Guide for complete authentication implementation
    details.
- information_source; https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/apis-docs/guides/developer-guides/common-errors/:
  - API key authentication is required. The API key must be provided and valid; invalid
    or revoked keys return 401 Unauthorized errors. Ensure the key has no trailing
    spaces and uses correct case in the URL.
  - Access tokens are required for API authentication. Tokens can expire or be revoked,
    requiring generation of new ones via SDKs or the Self-Service workspace. When
    a token expires or is revoked, the API returns a 401 Unauthorized status with
    error codes 38192 (expired) or 38193 (revoked). API credentials themselves can
    also be revoked due to security issues or account problems, in which case new
    keys must be generated in the Self-Service workspace.
  - The API uses OAuth2 with the client credentials grant type for authentication.
    Access tokens are sent in the Authorization header and must be refreshed when
    expired; only the client_credentials grant type is supported.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication via the Authorization header. Access
    tokens must be sent in the format "Bearer {access_token}" in the Authorization
    header; tokens are valid for 30 minutes and must be refreshed after expiration.
    Client credentials are also required and must be in a valid format. The Authorization
    header is mandatory and missing or malformed headers will result in a 401 error.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/apis-docs/guides/developer-guides/pagination/:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with the `page[offset]` query parameter.
    Pagination links are provided in the response under `meta.links.next` and `meta.links.last`;
    when `meta.links.next` is null, there are no more pages. The `meta.count` field
    indicates the total number of results available.
