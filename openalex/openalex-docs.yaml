notes:
- You can page through works and change the default number of results returned with
  the page and per-page parameters.
- Daily limit for API calls is 100,000 requests per user per day
- Snapshot is updated monthly
- Data is under a CC0 license
- Uses REST API.
- Uses a machine learning model to tag works with their relevance to Sustainable Development
  Goals.
- You must make sure that the ID(s) you supply are valid and correct.
- It's easy to filter works with the filter parameter
- This field requires an OpenAlex Premium subscription to access.
- Does not work without valid API key.
- By default we return 25 results per page.
- Works with more than 100 authors are truncated when retrieving a list of works.
- To see the full list of authors, go to the individual record for the work, which
  is never truncated.
- It's best to read about filters before trying these out. It will show you how to
  combine filters and build an AND, OR, or negation query.
- You can group sources with the group_by parameter
- Years with zero citations and zero works have been removed so you will need to add
  those back in if you need them.
- Uses REST API for concept data retrieval
- These are the original OpenAlex Concepts, which are being deprecated in favor of
  Topics.
- Queries are limited to between 20 and 2000 characters.
- The endpoints are rate limited to 1 per second and 1000 requests per day.
- The daily limit for API calls is 100,000 requests per user per day.
- For best performance, add your email to all API requests, like mailto=example@domain.com.
- Basic paging only works to get the first 10,000 results of any list
- You can use select to limit the fields that are returned in results.
- The fields you choose must exist within the entity.
- The sample size is limited to 10,000 results.
- You must provide a seed value when paging beyond the first page of results.
- The API is rate-limited with max 100,000 calls every day and max 10 requests every
  second.
- To get into the polite pool, you just have to give us an email where we can contact
  you.
- All the data is stored in Amazon S3, in the openalex bucket.
- The gzip-compressed snapshot takes up about 330 GB and decompresses to about 1.6
  TB.
- Load the OpenAlex entities as-is and query them directly.
- Loading the dataset into a relational database takes more work up front but allows
  simpler queries.
- This implementation can be slow due to the large size of data.
- OpenAlex data is licensed as CC0 so it is free to use and distribute.
- The database snapshot is updated about once per month.
errors:
- 'Exceeded daily limit: Reduce frequency of requests'
- '404 Not Found: Check the endpoint path or resource ID.'
- '400 Bad Request: Verify request parameters.'
- '403: If you request an illegal ID—such as one containing a `,` or `&`, the query
  will fail.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key'
