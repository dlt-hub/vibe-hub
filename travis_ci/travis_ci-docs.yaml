auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.travis-ci.com/api/:
  - 'API requests require authentication via a bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header. Include the header Authorization: token YOUR TRAVIS ACCESS TOKEN with
    each request to authenticate. All endpoints documented (environment variable creation,
    update, deletion, and SSH key retrieval) require this authentication.'
  - 'Authentication is required for all requests. Send your Travis CI access token
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: token YOUR TRAVIS ACCESS TOKEN".
    The token should be set via the Travis.access_token variable in Ruby or passed
    directly in the Authorization header for HTTP requests.'
  - 'Authentication is required for all settings endpoints. Send a Travis CI access
    token in the Authorization header using the format "Authorization: token YOUR
    TRAVIS ACCESS TOKEN". The token should be a valid Travis CI API token obtained
    from your Travis CI account.'
  - Authentication requires a Travis CI access token passed to the Travis client library
    via the Travis.access_token property. The token is used internally by the library
    to authenticate requests to the API, and the /accounts endpoint specifically requires
    authentication on every request.
  - 'Authentication uses a Travis CI access token passed in the Authorization header
    as a bearer token. Include the header "Authorization: token YOUR TRAVIS ACCESS
    TOKEN" in requests to authenticated endpoints like GET /users/permissions.'
