- information_source; https://docs.angellist.com/docs/overview:
  - AngelList's GraphQL API uses bearer token authentication with API keys. Include
    your API key in the Authorization header as "Bearer sk_test_..." for staging or
    "Bearer sk_live_..." for production. API keys are obtained by submitting a request
    to the AngelList team with your organization handle, desired environment, and
    user email addresses. Keys are shared via a secure link that expires within one
    hour.
