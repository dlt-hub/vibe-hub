notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- New projects are automatically using ESBuild mode.
- If you are switching from Legacy mode, update all your files in a similar way.
- Simplified structure does not require each file in your file tree to be imported.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in kaplay
- If your project was created before KAPLAYGROUND version 2.4, it is still using the
  old file structure and build mode.
- We strongly recommend you the Modern way that gives you more control and is a coding
  standard.
- Recommended installation method uses JavaScript modules.
- Legacy method also available for importing KAPLAY.
- All KAPLAY games start with the kaplay(opt?) function.
- Base interface of all game objects.
- You can actually get the root game object using getTreeRoot(), but it is not recommended
  to modify or interact with it.
- Changing the current scene will destroy all existing objects.
- To load a sprite, use the loadSprite() function with sprite name and path.
- Allows you to use the same event for mouse, keyboard, and gamepad.
- You can set generic names like 'jump' and bind it to the keys, gamepad/mouse buttons.
- Game Object is not always the answer
- Cleanup One-off Objects
- Hide Off-Screen Objects
- Avoid Global Namespace
- Compress Assets
- Use Game Object local timers
- A canvas is created by calling `makeCanvas` and passing its `width` and `height`.
- Using a particle emitter requires us to use the texture and frames data of a sprite.
- Don’t forget to wait for your sprites to load.
- Default mass is 1 for simple games.
- Gravity is constant and independent of mass.
- A shader can have parameters called uniforms.
- To apply fullscreen post-processing shader effects, use built-in usePostEffect method.
- The easiest way to make a game with Colyseus is by using the official KAPLAY + Colyseus
  quickstart repository
- Uses Colyseus framework for multiplayer games
- You might need to restart the Colyseus dev server when updating the schema(s)
- Uses KAPLAY framework for game development.
- Game objects are created in separate files for better organization.
- Movement logic is handled by the player object
- Puck authority switches based on the last player to hit it
- Score is broadcasted to all clients when a goal is scored
- Ensure to reset the score when a player joins or leaves.
- You can test your game on multiple devices in the same network by simply passing
  --host before starting the client dev server.
- Note that the server is hosted in EU region so overseas latency will be very high.
- Some objects like Player may require additional properties for proper movement and
  collision.
- This API enables real-time interaction for game objects.
- Puck disappears and reappears after scoring in the net.
- Player movement is disabled for a brief period after scoring.
- You should not commit the .colyseus-cloud.json file so better add it to your .gitignore.
- If stretch canvas to container when width and height is specified
- When stretching if keep aspect ratio and leave black bars on remaining spaces
- If register debug buttons (default true)
- Device pixel scale (defaults to 1, high pixel density will hurt performance)
- Disable antialias and enable sharp pixel display
- The canvas DOM element to use. If empty will create one
- The container DOM element to insert the canvas if created. Defaults to document.body
- Background color. E.g. [ 0, 0, 255 ] for solid blue background, or [ 0, 0, 0, 0
  ] for transparent background. Accepts RGB value array or string hex codes
- How many log messages can there be on one screen (default 8)
- How many seconds log messages stay on screen (default 4)
- Size of the spatial hash grid for collision detection (default 64)
- If translate touch events as mouse clicks (default true)
- If KAPLAY should render a default loading screen when assets are not fully ready
  (default true)
- If pause audio when tab is not active (default false)
- If focus on the canvas on start (default true)
- If import all KAPLAY functions to global (default true)
- Make component's id ("sprite" for sprite() comp) be added as tags. That means .is()
  will return true for components with that id.
- The title, it appears in the sidebar
- Communication with KAPLAY Dev internals is important for creating a guide
- Every game object is a child of the root game object.
- In v3001, KAPLAY by default will take component IDs as tags
- In next versions this is disabled by default
- Sprites can be loaded using the loadSprite function
- Game objects are great for managing game entities, but they have a cost.
- If you’re creating and destroying objects in an absurd rate, you should find another
  solution.
- Sometimes there are some objects that gets created, leaves screen, and never seen
  again, like a bullet.
- Sometimes you might be drawing a lot of objects that’s not on screen.
- By default KAPLAY uses a lot of common names like pos, sprite that occupies global
  namespace.
- Loading assets takes time, compress them when you can.
- When programming timer / tween behavior for a specific game object, it’s better
  to attach timer() component to the game object.
- When done, a canvas needs to be freed in order to free the WebGL buffer.
- The easiest way to ensure your sprite has been loaded is using loadSprite.
- You can easily load them into your game using the crew plugin
- Uses KAPLAY for game development.
- Players can move slightly past the center line due to overshoot.
- Cursor must be locked to control the player.
- Resets score when a player joins or leaves
- Server is hosted in EU region so overseas latency will be very high.
- To test your game with friends, your IP would have to be public, accessible to the
  outside world and port forwarded.
- You should not commit .colyseus-cloud.json file.
