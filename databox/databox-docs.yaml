auth_info:
- information_source; https://databox.com/our-methods-and-challenges-of-api-integration:
  - 'Databox Connect Flow supports two primary authentication approaches: OAuth2 or
    OAuth1 for acquiring and refreshing user-specific access tokens, or alternatively,
    users can securely provide plain credentials such as API keys or usernames and
    passwords for REST API or database integrations. Sensitive credentials are stored
    encrypted, and all requests are logged and monitored.'
- information_source; https://developers.databox.com/api/api.databox.com/auth:
  - The Databox API uses API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. Include
    your API key in the `x-api-key` header of requests. A 200 response indicates the
    key is valid, while 401 indicates the key is missing or invalid.
  - The Databox API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the `x-api-key`
    header for all requests. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
    obtained from your Databox account.
- information_source; https://developers.databox.com/api/overview:
  - 'The API uses API key authentication sent as a custom header. Include the header
    ''x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'' in all requests to the API endpoint.'
- information_source; https://help.databox.com/guide-using-rest-api-integrations-with-databox:
  - Rest APIs can be connected with no authentication, Basic Authentication, or API
    keys. Basic Authentication requires username and password credentials sent via
    the Authorization header. API key authentication requires an API key that can
    be sent as a header or query parameter depending on the specific REST API's requirements.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.databox.com/master-overview-custom-api-integrations:
  - When pagination is enabled in Databox Custom Metric settings, you select a pagination
    type (Page or Cursor) from the Pagination dropdown. For Page type, the system
    extracts the "next" link from the previous response to construct subsequent requests.
    For Cursor type, it extracts the "cursor" value from the previous response. The
    pagination limit is capped at 100 maximum results per request, and pagination
    starts from the first page only.
