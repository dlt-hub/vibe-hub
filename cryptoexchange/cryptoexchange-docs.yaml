  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" in all requests, where your-api-key
    is replaced with your actual API key generated from account settings. Alternatively,
    basic authentication is supported using your email address as username and API
    key as password.'
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header with the format "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key". The API key is a
    string value (example: 99_ABCDefGHIKFD93423489023eejkfjkdjkjkjkjkjkjkabcdefgyz4534343kdlPp)
    that you have created and must be passed in the Authorization header of every
    request.'
  - 'The Escrow API supports two authentication methods: email/password credentials
    encoded in Base64 format passed via the Authorization header with Bearer scheme,
    or API keys passed via the Authorization header with Bearer scheme. To authenticate,
    base64-encode your email:password credentials or use your API key directly, then
    include the header Authorization: Bearer <encoded-credentials-or-api-key>.'
  - 'The Escrow API uses HTTP Basic Authentication as defined in RFC2617. You can
    authenticate using either username and password or API keys. To authenticate,
    base64 encode your email address and API key separated by a colon (email:api_key)
    and send it in the Authorization header as "Basic [base64_encoded_string]". For
    example, john.fulton@cryptoexchange.com:myhorseisamazing base64 encodes to a2VhbnUucmVldmVzQGVzY3Jvdy5jb206bXlob3JzZWlzYW1hemluZw==,
    which you would send as Authorization: Basic a2VhbnUucmVldmVzQGVzY3Jvdy5jb206bXlob3JzZWlzYW1hemluZw==.'
