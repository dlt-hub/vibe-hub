  - 'Authentication is performed via API key passed in the Authorization header. Send
    a GET request to the endpoint with the header "Authorization: {api_key}" where
    api_key is your unique API key obtained from your account. Alternatively, basic
    auth with customer_id and api_key credentials is supported.'
- information_source; https://jsonwhoisapi.com:
  - 'Authentication requires an API key sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header. The header format is "Authorization: {api_key}" where api_key is your
    unique API key obtained from your account. Alternatively, basic authentication
    can be used with customer_id and api_key credentials.'
- information_source; https://jsonwhoisapi.com/docs:
  - Authentication requires sending your customer ID and API key with each request.
    Refer to the authentication section of the documentation for the exact header
    or parameter names and format for sending these credentials.
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Credentials consist of customer_id as username
    and api_key as password, sent via the Authorization header using the format "Basic
    base64(customer_id:api_key)". Alternatively, credentials can be passed directly
    in the URL as customer_id:api_key@host or via auth parameters in request libraries.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with customer ID and API key credentials.
    Send requests with the Authorization header using the format `--user '{customer_id}:{api_key}'`,
    where customer_id and api_key are your authentication credentials provided by
    the service.
