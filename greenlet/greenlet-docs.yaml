notes:
- greenlet allows switching between synchronous and asynchronous operations without
  additional threads
- The GUI's event loop is not in control of when it is called
- Cycles involving data that is present in a greenletâ€™s frames may not be detected.
- Storing references to other greenlets cyclically may lead to leaks.
