auth_info:
- information_source; https://hivebrite.com/documentation/api/admin:
  - Access tokens are required and passed in requests to identify the current admin
    user. The access_token is used to determine which admin owns the request and is
    included in the Authorization header or as a query parameter, though the exact
    header name and format are not explicitly specified in this documentation excerpt.
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. Use grant_type password with admin_email, password,
    client_id, and client_secret parameters, or grant_type refresh_token with refresh_token,
    client_id, and client_secret parameters. Send credentials as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    in the request body to the /oauth/token endpoint. The scope parameter is required
    with value admin.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://hivebrite.com/documentation/api/admin:
  - Pagination is handled via the Link header following RFC 5988 with rel="first"
    and similar relationships. Request parameters include page and per_page query
    parameters (per_page=30 shown in example). The response Link header contains URLs
    for navigation between pages.
  - Pagination uses Link headers with rel="next" and rel="last" to indicate available
    pages. Request pagination via optional query parameters page and per_page (default
    per_page is 30). Response headers include x-page (current page), x-per-page (items
    per page), and x-total (total items).
  - Pagination uses RFC 5988 Link header with rel="first", "prev", "next", "last"
    containing page and per_page query parameters. Response headers include x-per-page
    (page size), x-total (total count), and x-page (current page number).
  - 'Pagination uses RFC 5988 Link headers with rel values (first, prev, next, last)
    and query parameters page and per_page. Response headers include x-per-page, x-total,
    and x-page. Query parameters: page (integer, default unspecified) and per_page
    (integer, default unspecified) control pagination; construct next request using
    the next URL from Link header.'
  - Pagination uses RFC 5988 Link headers with rel="first", "prev", "last", and "next"
    to navigate pages. Request parameters page and per_page control pagination in
    query string, with per_page defaulting to 30. The Link header contains URLs for
    first, previous, last, and next pages to construct subsequent requests.
