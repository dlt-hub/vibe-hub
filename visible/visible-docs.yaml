auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.visible.vc/:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" with GET requests to authenticate.
  - Each API request must include an access token in the Authorization HTTP header
    using Bearer authentication with the format Bearer <your-token>. The token is
    issued to a specific Visible user and grants access to the same companies that
    user has access to. To obtain a token, contact dev@visible.vc.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.visible.vc/:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with a page query parameter (integer, required,
    minimum 1, default 1). The response includes a metrics array. Continue to the
    next page by incrementing the page parameter until no more results are returned.
  - The GET /metrics endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameter page
    (optional, defaults to 1). Response includes meta object with page (current page
    number), total (total items), and total_pages (total pages available). Increment
    page parameter to retrieve subsequent pages; stop when page exceeds total_pages.
