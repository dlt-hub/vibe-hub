auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/art-blocks-api/api-overview/:
  - Art Blocks API uses JWT-based authentication. To authenticate, first call the
    GraphQL query getAuthMessage with publicAddress, domain, and uri parameters to
    retrieve an auth message. Sign this message client-side using a signer, then call
    the GraphQL mutation Authenticate with an AuthenticateInput containing the signed
    message to receive a JWT. Use this JWT in subsequent requests to access the authenticated
    GraphQL API.
  - JWT Bearer token authentication is required for the GraphQL API. Include the JWT
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer ${jwt}" when making POST requests
    to the GraphQL endpoint.
  - The API requires an API key to be included in the GraphQL endpoint URL path. Replace
    `[api-key]` in the endpoint `https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/{subgraph-id}`
    with your actual API key. The key is passed as a URL path segment, not as a header
    or query parameter.
  - The API uses JWT bearer token authentication. After obtaining a JWT token through
    a two-step process (fetching a message to sign, then submitting the signed message
    with publicAddress and signature to the /api/authenticate endpoint), include the
    JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to the Art Blocks GraphQL
    API.
  - The Art Blocks GraphQL API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. A JWT must
    be obtained first and then included in subsequent requests to gain authenticated
    access to the GraphQL API. The documentation indicates this is intended for client-side
    environments, but the specific details on how to obtain the JWT and the exact
    header name or parameter for sending it are not provided in this excerpt.
