notes:
- Autobahn|Python provides open-source implementations of the WebSocket Protocol and
  WAMP for Python 3.7+.
- Autobahn|Python up to version v19.11.2 supported Python 2 and 3.4+, and up to version
  v20.7.1 supported Python 3.5+, and up to version v21.2.1 supported Python 3.6+.
- Most of Autobahn’s WebSocket and WAMP features are available on both Twisted and
  asyncio, so you are free to choose the underlying networking framework based on
  your own criteria.
- Autobahn is portable, well tuned code.
- NVX is automatically enabled in binary wheels on macOS ARM64, Windows x86_64, and
  Linux ARM64.
- Linux x86_64 wheels are built WITHOUT NVX to ensure maximum compatibility.
- NVX is automatically enabled in binary wheels on macOS ARM64, Windows x86_64, and

- Tests Autobahn|Python WebSocket clients against the Autobahn|Testsuite server (fuzzingserver
  mode)
- Tests Autobahn|Python WebSocket servers against the Autobahn|Testsuite client (fuzzingclient
  mode)
- WAMP is a routed protocol, requires a WAMP Router to communicate
- Components can connect to multiple WAMP routers
- FlatBuffers is integrated as one of several WAMP protocol base serializers
- Application payloads are stored as CBOR-encoded bytes inside the FlatBuffers message
  structure and decoded only when accessed.
- Zero-copy deserialization - Messages can be accessed directly from wire buffers
  without parsing overhead
- Smaller message size - Typically 20-30% smaller than JSON for WAMP messages
- Faster processing - Up to 10x faster than JSON for complex messages, crucial for
  high-throughput applications
- FlatBuffers for protocol, CBOR for payloads
- Zero-copy transport and lazy payload deserialization
- Experimental - Read-Only Implementation
- 'Only 2 of 24 WAMP message types implemented: EVENT (type 36) and PUBLISH (type
  8)'
- Explicitly disabled - FlatBuffers does not support message batching currently
- Current FlatBuffers integration is experimental and has significant limitations
- 'Read-only implementation: Can receive FlatBuffers messages from advanced routers,
  but cannot send them'
- Current implementation uses FlatBuffers for envelope, CBOR for application payloads
- Future implementation will use FlatBuffers for both envelope and payloads
- Use `pip install autobahn` within your Conda environment to get the latest version
  with native wheels from PyPI.
- 'Conda packages require additional steps beyond publishing to PyPI: A maintainer
  must update the autobahn-feedstock repository with the new version.'
- The conda-forge version may be weeks or months behind PyPI.
- 'Best Practice: Always use `pip install autobahn` within Conda environments to get
  the latest version with native wheels from PyPI.'
errors:
- 'NotImplementedError: serialize() raises NotImplementedError - cannot send FlatBuffers
  messages'
- 'Only 2 of 24 WAMP message types implemented: EVENT (type 36) and PUBLISH (type
  8)'
- 'Batching: Explicitly disabled - FlatBuffers does not support message batching currently'
