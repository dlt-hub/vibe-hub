auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.xs2a.com/:
  - API key authentication is required. Include your Test-API key using HTTP Basic
    Auth where the username is 'api' and the password is your API key. The key can
    be obtained from the developer portal at https://developer.xs2a.com/.
  - API key authentication is required. Send credentials using HTTP Basic Auth with
    username "api" and the API key as the password, encoded in base64 in the Authorization
    header as "Basic base64(api:YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE)". Alternatively, use the authenticateWith('api',
    apiKey) method in the PHP client or pass the API key directly when initializing
    the XS2A client in Node.js.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key. Send credentials in the
    Authorization header as "Basic base64('api:YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE')" where YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
    is your actual API key. Alternatively, pass the API key directly to the client
    constructor (e.g., new XS2A('your-api-key')) or use authenticateWith('api', $apiKey)
    method.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Include an Authorization header with the
    value "Basic" followed by base64-encoded credentials in the format "api:YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE",
    where YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE is replaced with your actual API key.
