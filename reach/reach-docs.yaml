  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required using the OAuth2PasswordBearer scheme. Credentials
    must be provided in the Authorization header as a bearer token (format: "Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token}").'
  - OAuth2 authentication is required. Use the OAuth2PasswordBearer scheme to authenticate
    requests. The exact implementation details for token acquisition, scope requirements,
    and header format are not provided in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'OAuth2 is used for authorization. Include the OAuth2 bearer token in the Authorization
    header when making requests to protected endpoints like Delete Relationship and
    Create Responses. The token should be sent as "Authorization: Bearer {token}".'
  - OAuth2 password bearer authentication is required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
  - OAuth2 token-based authentication is required. Call the Create Token endpoint
    with your API Username and Password (provided by Reach support, different from
    login credentials) in the request body as form-encoded data. The token expires
    after 30 minutes and must be passed to access other API endpoints. Tokens are
    obtained via POST to the Create Token endpoint with username and password parameters
    in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.reach.vote/:
  - 'Our pagination strategy varies by route: some endpoints use keyset pagination
    (like /v1/pipelines/instances) while others use offset pagination (like /v1/my-history)
    to support complex sorting and deduplication. Specific pagination parameters and
    response fields are not detailed in this section.'
