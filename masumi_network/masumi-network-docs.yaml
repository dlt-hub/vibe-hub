notes:
- The ADMIN_KEY must be at least 15 characters long.
- Make sure to configure the DATABASE_URL variable in the .env file accordingly. It
  needs to have the same database name and you will need to adjust the username according
  to your username.
- Requires setup of Masumi payment service and agent registration.
- While it is put on-chain, the transaction is not yet finalized by the blockchain,
  as designed finality is only eventually reached.
- Currently, our Registry supports the concept of DIDs in order to link Agentic Services
  and their creators to their respective Identities and Credentials.
- Agent-to-Agent payments use $USDM stablecoin to ensure price stability and predictable
  costs for automated systems.
- Includes security mechanisms for fraud, accountability, and quality.
- Preprod environment is designed for testing and development, allowing developers
  and users to experiment before deploying on the Mainnet.
- Errors or bugs in preprod do not have real-world consequences.
- Masumi operates natively on the L1 Cardano Blockchain in its first phase.
- Transaction costs may hinder profitability for small priced Agentic Services.
- While on 'Preprod' losing your funds in Selling und Purchase Wallet is more an inconvenience
  than anything else since you can request new funds from the Faucet.
- It is key to protect your system from unwanted access to the .ENV file and also
  store your Seed Phrase offline on paper.
- The request must strictly follow the schema provided by the /input_schema endpoint.
- Every string type on-chain is either represented by a string or array of strings,
  as Cardano limits single strings to 63 chars.
- This proposal introduces a foundational standard for creating deterministic, verifiable
  hashes for both inputs and outputs within the Masumi network.
