notes:
- Enable Kerberos (SPNEGO) in Ignition for user authentication
- Use Kerberos tickets to authenticate REST API requests (e.g., using curl, PowerShell,
  or a browser)
- Make sure that Ignition is installed and running on the domain-joined Windows machine.
- The domain controller has DNS and reverse DNS entries for your Ignition server.
- You have admin access to Ignition and the Windows server.
- A Service Principal Name (SPN) is created for the Ignition server.
- Kerberos keytab is available or can be created.
- Ensure the Ignition service has read access to the .keytab.
- Modern browsers support SPNEGO automatically if the Ignition FQDN is in the intranet
  zone
- Postman does not support Kerberos/SPNEGO natively — use curl or a tool like httpie
  or custom code
- Check SPN, keytab, realm spelling
- SPN not registered or mismatch
- Wrong KDC hostname or firewall issue
- Run kinit again or re-login
- Ensure Ignition has read access
- Mobile browsers act like they have low-res screens despite their high-res screen
  hardware.
- No simple solution for Perspective.
- If I were to attempt this, I'd create a tag provider that mirrors another.
- Uses expression language for polling configuration.
- An update is currently busy of the one present on the exchange and this will then
  be included.
- Roles & Permissions were not migrated correctly, all roles ended up set to Administrator.
- Some specific JDBC drivers were not migrated properly, for example the Denodo JDBC
  Drivers.
- The MySQL driver is marked as unhealthy, which is odd since it comes bundled with
  Ignition.
- TTS Voice - es_sara was not migrated correctly.
- You can perform selective distribution of projects using EAM.
- There can only be one EAM Controller in a Gateway Network.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Best way to do this is to make 2 custom style classes, one for good value and one
  for bad value.
- Bindings must return a value, they don't work by side effects.
- 'Request format is invalid: application/xml.'
- The certificate from an OPC UA application you are connecting to or receiving a
  connection from has a certificate that violates the spec in some way, but instead
  of rejecting the connection we're logging a warning and allowing it.
- Three years after the 8.0 release a steady trickle of support tickets came in and
  they are just now stopping.
- The self-signed certs expired, and then the next time the gateway restarted or connection
  was reset, the loopback OPC UA connection failed.
- There were also many, many support calls over the years about other 3rd party clients
  or server who got the certificate generation wrong in some way or another.
- At some point in relatively recent history I basically made the default certificate
  validation logic treat all checks that the spec allows to be optional/suppressed
  as optional.
- When deploying Ignition with data persistence on an EFS disk, an error occurs indicating
  that init.properties is missing.
- Deploying the image without data persistence on EFS works without issues.
- The tags that cause problems are the opc tag, collected via a KEPServerEX, for The
  database, yes it's in another machine.
- Honestly the only ways I've seen the historian give a primary key collision is when
  there is a discrepancy in the date and time of where the OPC Server is and where
  the Database is.
- Using empty brackets as the provider in a tag path may result in an invalid path
  in a Gateway script.
- Non-transparent redundancy means that a client has to understand there are two or
  more servers and manage connecting to another server in the server set when the
  'primary' goes down.
- The whole URI thing is broken anyway and the configuration on the backup gets overwritten
  the first time a full sync happens.
- Design to the smallest resolution you plan to support and let it scale up from there.
- Session messages sent with system.util.sendMessage() can only be caught by message
  handlers defined on the session.
- Component message handlers can only catch messages sent with system.perspective.sendMessage().
- Ideally, you don't run your Designer on the same machine as the Gateway.
- Your connection string in ignition would need to start with your computer's IP or
  hostname, not localhost.
- Recent versions have scaling issues with the Component Scripting window.
- Tags (with the exception of Vision Client Tags) are independent of the visualization
  module being used.
- Gateway tags are not part of projects, and are equally accessible from Vision and
  Perspective.
- Safer method might be to call .strip() on the result of the original trim, I can
  foresee someone not including that space between [Default] and the -.
