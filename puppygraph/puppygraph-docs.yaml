auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.puppygraph.com/querying/querying-using-gremlin/:
  - The Gremlin client requires basic authentication with username and password credentials.
    For the Python client, pass username and password parameters when creating the
    Client object connecting to the WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `ws://localhost:8182/gremlin`).
    The credentials are sent as part of the client connection handshake. For the Go
    driver, authentication details are not shown in the provided example, but the
    same WebSocket connection pattern is used.
- information_source; https://docs.puppygraph.com/querying/querying-using-opencypher/:
  - Authentication uses basic auth credentials passed to the GraphDatabase.driver()
    method. The uri parameter specifies the connection endpoint (bolt://localhost:7687),
    and auth is provided as a tuple of (username, password) where username is "puppygraph"
    and password is "puppygraph123". These credentials are sent with each driver connection
    established via GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password)).
