auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/validate-e911-address/:
  - Basic authentication is required using a username and password pair sent via the
    `-u` flag. The username is the TECHPREFIX and the password is the APISECRETKEY,
    which are transmitted as HTTP Basic Auth credentials in the Authorization header.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are provided as accessKey
    and secretKey in the format `accessKey:secretKey` passed via the `-u` flag in
    cURL or as a Basic Auth header. The Python API Wrapper handles this automatically
    when installed and configured.
- information_source; https://developer.flowroute.com/api/:
  - HTTP Basic Auth is required for the Messaging APIs. For v2.0, v2.1, and v2.2 of
    the Messages API, include credentials in the Authorization header using the format
    "Basic base64(username:password)".
- information_source; https://developer.flowroute.com/api/message-provision/v2.0/:
  - HTTP Basic Auth is required. Use your Access Key from Flowroute Manage as the
    username and your Secret Key as the password. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header as base64-encoded "Access Key:Secret Key" following the HTTP Basic Auth
    standard.
- information_source; https://developer.flowroute.com/libraries/v3/python:
  - Basic authentication is required. Credentials are passed via environment variables
    FR_ACCESS_KEY (username) and FR_SECRET_KEY (password), then provided to the FlowroutenumbersandmessagingClient
    constructor as basic_auth_user_name and basic_auth_password parameters for HTTP
    Basic Auth.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.flowroute.com/libraries/v3/python:
  - 'Offset-based pagination is used with limit and offset query parameters. The limit
    parameter controls the number of results per page (example: limit=3), and the
    offset parameter specifies the starting position (example: offset=0). The response
    includes a links object with self and next URLs; use the next URL to fetch the
    subsequent page, and stop when the next link is absent.'
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters. The limit parameter controls the
    number of results returned per request, and offset is used to specify the starting
    position for retrieving subsequent pages of results.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters. limit specifies the number of records
    per page (required), and offset specifies the starting position (required). The
    response returns an array of e911 objects; continue paginating by incrementing
    offset by the limit value until fewer records than limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter controls
    page size (default 3 in example), offset controls the starting position, and the
    response includes a self link showing the current pagination state.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter controls
    page size, and offset specifies the starting position. The response includes a
    next link for retrieving the next page of results.
