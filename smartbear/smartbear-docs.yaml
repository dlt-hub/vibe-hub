notes:
- Headers may carry information for request and response body, authorization, caching,
  and cookies.
- Request headers need to be set when sending requests for API testing.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Test automation, performance validation, and virtualization for teams that can't
  afford to slow down
- Standardize design styles across teams
- Increase API adoption through quality.
- Cloud-based testing solutions available.
- SmartBear allowed Aras Corporation to evaluate ReadyAPI on its own terms.
- The ability to talk to the pre-sales team, to get the SmartBear support team involved
  when we were trying to figure stuff out, meant we had a great collaboration.
- Certain Solutions are made available to Customer on a SaaS basis.
- AI Output shall be deemed Customer Data subject to the AI provider’s terms and conditions.
- SmartBear does not guarantee accuracy of any AI Output generated by the AI Enabled
  Features.
- AI Enabled Features are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.
- The Data Processing Addendum was last updated on May 17, 2022.
- Prohibited uses and activities include, without limitation, any use of the SaaS
  in a manner that, in SmartBear’s reasonable judgment, involves, facilitates, or
  attempts any of the following.
- The Trial Version may have limited features.
- You must stop use of the Service or Licensed Software at the end of the Trial Period.
- Premier peer code and document review tool for development teams
- Comprehensive review capabilities for many types of artifacts
- Streamline API testing with end-to-end validation
- Consistent quality and security at scale
- API-capable is no longer optional.
- You don't need a complete architectural overhaul or a flashy API portal to unlock
  the value of APIs.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance to protect sensitive API definitions and
  meet financial regulatory standards.
- Proven reliability and user familiarity, with internal stakeholders already confident
  in the platform’s capabilities.
- Cost-effective scalability without sacrificing functionality, supporting a growing
  API footprint across the organization.
- Automated governance and validation with built-in rules that reduced manual review
  and ensured policy compliance.
- Enabled early testing and collaboration using API mocking to validate designs pre-implementation.
- Centralized documentation and version control, providing a single source of truth
  for all API definitions.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Testing APIs directly helps teams catch issues earlier, reduce time to resolution,
  and improve the reliability of the services they build and maintain.
- API virtualization allows testing an API in isolation, gauging the reaction against
  real data.
- Select a small, stable API for the pilot program.
- Notepad is a desktop application
- Functional tests include running, checking text input, and stopping the application
- Automated regression tests need careful oversight to catch all bugs.
- Starting simple can be a good strategy to test the waters
- The important part of integration to remember is that it comes in layers
- If the assertion fails, the load test stops.
- Automated testing will shorten your development cycles, avoid cumbersome repetitive
  tasks and help improve software quality.
- Creating test data for your automated tests is boring, but you should invest time
  and effort into creating data that is well structured.
- With good test data available, writing automated tests becomes a lot easier.
- Codeless Monitor creation - simply paste the Endpoint URL or reuse API functional
  tests
- Monitoring tools provide insights into user experience and performance metrics.
- Automate test runs across multiple environments using Jenkins, TeamCity, or Azure
  DevOps
