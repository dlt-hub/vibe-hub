notes:
- Unicode fully supported
- Pure-Python implementation
- Grammars may contain non-obvious bugs, usually caused by rules or terminals interfering
  with each other in subtle ways.
- Interegular currently only runs when the lexer is basic or contextual.
- Some advanced regex features, such as lookahead and lookbehind, may prevent interegular
  from detecting existing collisions.
- Transformers & Visitors provide a convenient interface to process the parse-trees
  that Lark returns.
- Lark currently cannot import templates from Nearley
- Lark currently cannot export grammars to Nearley
errors:
- 'lark.exceptions.GrammarError: Shift/Reduce conflict for terminal A. [strict-mode]'
