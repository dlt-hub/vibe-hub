auth_info:
- information_source; https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/:
  - Authentication uses an auth_token parameter that must be included in all requests.
    The auth_token is obtained by signing in and should be passed as a query parameter
    named auth_token with the value AUTH_TOKEN in requests to endpoints like GET /posts/?auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN.
    An optional public parameter set to true can be added to enable public usage mode
    instead of private user-specific settings.
  - 'Authentication uses an auth_token query parameter. Include auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN
    as a query parameter in all API requests. A 401 error indicates an invalid or
    missing auth_token. Rate limits depend on your API plan (GROWTH or ENTERPRISE)
    and are enforced at two levels: requests per second and monthly request cap.'
- information_source; https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/about:
  - To access the CryptoPanic API, you must first sign in to obtain an API key. Add
    your API key to requests using the auth_token query parameter in the format https://cryptopanic.com/api/API_PLAN/v2/posts/?auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN,
    where AUTH_TOKEN is your unique API key. Rate limits and quotas vary by subscription
    plan (Developer, Growth, or Enterprise).
- information_source; https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/legacy:
  - Users must sign up to obtain an API auth token. The token is passed as a query
    parameter or header (exact parameter/header name not specified in documentation)
    to authenticate requests. API access is rate-limited at 5 req/sec for free plans
    or 10 req/sec for paid plans, and all requests are logged. Private API methods
    use the authenticated user's settings.
