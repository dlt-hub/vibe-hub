notes:
- Deprecation of old endpoints after August 1st 2025.
- The API requires setting maxResults (up to 5000) for bounded JQL queries.
- The API doesn’t validate JQL queries automatically.
- Atlassian’s platform changes require transition to native Forge events.
- Some properties may be missing due to deprecation.
- New example scripts available in-app for quicker access.
- The transition to native Forge events is required due to Atlassian’s platform changes
  and the deprecation of the old event model. These new Forge events have a different
  structure and do not include all properties previously available. Some event properties
  are now missing and cannot be retrieved from the Atlassian API.
- Please ensure your custom scripts or Marketplace apps no longer reference deprecated
  fields.
- HAPI respects the permissions of the current user by default.
- Some operations in Jira are restricted for Atlassian Connect apps.
- ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud does not have the same feature set as the Server/Data
  Center version.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Parent and child issue associations are being standardised for company-managed and
  team-managed projects.
- Deprecated fields include 'Epic Link' and 'Parent Link'.
- Understanding the distinction between pre-defined Atlassian fields and custom fields
  is crucial for handling rich text content.
- There is no workaround for retrieving these properties via the Atlassian REST API.

- '400 Bad Request: Unbounded queries will return this error.'
- Invalid queries will result in errors that must be handled manually.
- 500 status code errors are automatically retried once.
- 502, 503, and 504 errors are automatically retried three times.
- 429 (Too Many Requests) error indicates that the system was under heavy load and
  eventually hit Atlassian's rate limit.
