auth_info:
- information_source; https://freesound.org/docs/api/authentication.html:
  - API key authentication via token parameter or Authorization header, or OAuth2
    authorization code grant flow. For token auth, pass the API key as a GET parameter
    named token or in the Authorization header as Token YOUR_API_KEY. For OAuth2,
    redirect users to Freesound login, receive an authorization grant as a GET parameter,
    then exchange it for an access token to include in subsequent API requests.
  - 'Freesound API uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Exchange the authorization
    code for an access token by making a POST request to https://freesound.org/apiv2/oauth2/access_token/
    with POST parameters: client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to ''authorization_code'',
    and code. The response includes access_token, scope, expires_in, and refresh_token.
    Use the access_token in all subsequent API calls. Authorization codes expire after
    10 minutes.'
  - OAuth2 Bearer token authentication. Access tokens must be included in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" and have a 24-hour lifetime. Authorization codes
    (10-minute lifetime, single-use) are exchanged for access tokens via POST request
    with grant_type parameter. Expired tokens return 401 responses; use the refresh_token
    parameter to obtain new access tokens without restarting the full OAuth2 flow.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Redirect users to https://freesound.org/apiv2/oauth2/authorize/
    with GET parameters: client_id (your application''s client ID), response_type
    (must be ''code''), and state (optional arbitrary value for CSRF protection).
    All OAuth2 requests must use HTTPS. Users authenticate and grant permission on
    Freesound, then are redirected back to your application with an authorization
    code.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with refresh token support. To refresh an expired
    access token, POST to https://freesound.org/apiv2/oauth2/access_token/ with grant_type
    set to 'refresh_token', your client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token parameter.
    The response provides a new access token and refresh token. Access tokens can
    be revoked by users, resulting in 401 Unauthorized responses with 'Invalid token'
    error.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://freesound.org/docs/api/resources_apiv2.html:
  - Combined Search uses a `more` link in responses to paginate through results instead
    of `next` and `previous` links. The `results` list length may be less than the
    specified `page_size`, so verify the list length to detect the end of pagination.
    The `count` field is absent, so total result count is unknown. Use the `more`
    link value as the URL for the next request to fetch additional results.
  - Pagination for Content Search uses query parameters page and page_size. The response
    returns a sound list with the same pagination structure as standard sound list
    responses, where page specifies the page number and page_size specifies results
    per page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number) and page_size (results per
    page), with response structure matching the sound list endpoint. The fields parameter
    allows selecting specific response fields.
  - Parameters `page` and `page_size` control pagination in query string. The response
    includes `next` and `previous` fields with links to navigate pages; use these
    links for subsequent requests or stop when `next` or `previous` is null.
  - Search results use offset-based pagination with query parameters page and page_size
    to control pagination. The response includes count (total results), next and previous
    (links to adjacent pages, null if none), and results array containing the current
    page of sounds. Use the next or previous links to navigate pages.
