notes:
- The Monitoring tab in the Celonis Platform will only display errors that occur after
  the file has been successfully uploaded.
- Errors that occur prior to the file being uploaded will not be displayed on the
  Monitoring tab and should be addressed on the client side.
- Celonis Platform features and APIs rely on rate limits to help provide a predictable
  experience for users.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Celonis is moving away from long term API/Application keys and towards OAuth.
- The scope 'integration.data-pools' must be configured.
- Client must have both viewing and managing the data pool permissions enabled.
- OAuth client needs the scope integration.data-pools to use all of the APIs.
- The application key requires Edit permissions on the corresponding data pool.
- API Keys will be deprecated in the coming months.
- OAuth2.0 client with grant_type=authorization_code has now been released in private
  preview. Please contact your account team to get early access.
- For production solutions, use OAuth 2.0 instead of static keys.
- Credentials sent in the URL or body of the request will be ignored.
- All endpoints that return results in the form of lists provide the ability to paginate
  their results by leveraging page-based pagination.
- The default value for pageSize is 50 meaning that the maximum number of items that
  can be retrieved in each call is 50.
- Celonis APIs were not built to export RAW data on a large scale but to make the
  calculated results and insights from process mining available to 3rd party platforms
  and applications.
- Celonis reserves the right to adjust the rate limits at any time to guarantee high-quality
  service for all clients.
- In order to have access to a specific Knowledge Model and its contents, the Knowledge
  Model must be published in the Celonis Platform.
- The returned data corresponds to the last published version of the Knowledge Model.
- 'OAuth clients for Knowledge Model API should be configured with the scope: intelligence.knowledge-models:read'
- 'OAuth clients for Subscription API should be configured with the scope: intelligence.subscriptions:manage'
- The maximum size allowed for pushed files is 1 GB.
- Uses Standard Data Ingestion API for S3 compatible buckets
- Save the configuration and note down the Access Key and Access Secret.
- The API will update data once a day overnight, so you will not see the latest data
  immediately after connection.
- The API key will have an automatic 90 day expiration period.
- The Reporting API is organized in objects that share a set of similar attributes.
- The maximum limit is 100, which will be applied if no limit is set.
- MCP clients authenticate using either OAuth 2.0 (recommended for production) or
  Application Keys (suitable for development and testing).
- OAuth 2.0 is the recommended authentication method for production use.
- Ensure your MCP Server asset is published and the MCP Server URL is correct.
- Client secret post authentication method required
- 'Scopes to select: audit.log:read, platform-adoption.tracking-events:read, team.login-history:read'
- 'This API supports multiple methods of authentication: Via OAuth 2.0 token with
  scope audit.log:read, passed in an HTTP header like this: Authorization: Bearer
  TOKEN.'
- This API supports multiple methods of authentication
- ALL SCIM OPERATIONS ARE SCOPED TO A TEAM. CHANGES TO A USER IN ONE TEAM DO NOT AFFECT
  ANY OTHER MEMBERSHIPS FOR THAT USER.
- ALL TEAM OPERATIONS ARE SCOPED TO A CELONIS PLATFORM TEAM.
- Preferred method via OAuth 2.0 token with a scope platform-adoption.tracking-events:read
- Uncompressed parquet files only. Alternative file formats must be converted to parquet
  before being ingested.
- The Standard Data Ingestion API always performs delta loads. Make sure to define
  the primary keys to ensure proper updates and avoid duplicates.
- Single files and multiple files simultaneously (using a first in, first out or FIFO
  method).
- Only the endpoints, headers, query and path parameters explicitly listed in this
  specification are supported.
