notes:
- 'AI Relight is a compute-intensive process: you can expect the API call to typically
  take between 5 and 10 seconds to complete.'
- AI Relight is currently limited to images with a maximum resolution of 3,500x3,500
  pixels.
- We don't recommend using AI Relight along with AI Expand in a same API call.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Pricing is €0.10 per image
- Response time varies by API.
- Some APIs do not support changing the aspect ratio.
- 'response time: ~5 seconds'
- 'response time: ~15 seconds'
- 'response time: ~35 seconds, doesn''t support changing the aspect ratio'
- 'response time: ~20 seconds, doesn''t support changing the aspect ratio'
- Doesn't support changing the aspect ratio
- 'response time: ~2 seconds, doesn''t support cropping to the bounds of the subject'
- 'response time: ~450 milliseconds'
- 'response time: ~600 milliseconds'
- 'response time: ~2 seconds'
- doesn't support cropping to the bounds of the subject
- 'response time: depends on the machine running the model'
- Doesn't support cropping to the bounds of the subject
- Uses API key for authentication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some endpoints may have varying response times
- The default rate limit was updated from 500 to 60 per minute, for new users only.
- Sandbox mode allows up to 1,000 free API calls per month with a maximum of 100 per
  day.
- The Remove Background API now supports WebP format for the result image.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
