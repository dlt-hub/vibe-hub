auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference/post_bookings-bookingid-cancel:
  - OAuth2 with Bearer token authentication. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}". Token is obtained via the Generate an OAuth 2.0 token
    endpoint.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference:
  - This API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant type for token-based authentication.
    Send a POST request to https://identity.officernd.com/oauth/token with grant_type
    set to "client_credentials", a required scope parameter, and client_id and client_secret
    credentials (via request body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded). The response
    returns a token string with token_type and expires_in (3600 seconds), which should
    be used in subsequent API requests as a bearer token. Tokens expire after one
    hour.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/docs/making-your-first-api-request:
  - API requests require bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" where {token} is your API token obtained from the OfficeRnD
    application. The header name is "authorization" and the format is "Bearer" followed
    by your token value.
  - Use OAuth2 client credentials flow with client_id and client_secret obtained from
    your application to generate an authentication token. Include the token in the
    Authorization header as a Bearer token for API requests. The organisation slug
    is also required as part of the request path or query parameters.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/docs/generating-a-token:
  - 'OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain an access token from
    https://identity.officernd.com/oauth/token, which returns a Bearer token with
    token_type "Bearer" and expires_in 3599 seconds. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" for all API requests. The token
    grants scopes officernd.api.read and officernd.api.write.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/docs/building-queries:
  - Use $limit query parameter (mandatory on certain endpoints, default 100, cannot
    exceed 100) to specify result count. Use $next query parameter in combination
    with $limit to navigate pages; if $next is not provided, the first page is returned.
    The $next parameter value from the previous response points to the start of the
    current page for constructing subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference/get_teams:
  - Use query parameters $limit (required), $next (optional), and $prev (optional)
    to paginate results. The $limit parameter defines the number of results per page,
    while $next and $prev parameters are page pointers used to navigate to subsequent
    or previous pages respectively.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference/get_members:
  - Use query parameters $limit (required), $next (string), and $prev (string) for
    pagination. The $limit parameter defines the number of results returned per page,
    while $next and $prev are pointers used to navigate to subsequent and previous
    pages respectively.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference/get_posts:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with required query parameter $limit specifying
    the number of results to return, and optional $next and $prev string parameters
    for navigating to subsequent or previous pages respectively. The response contains
    an array of objects with _id fields.
- information_source; https://developer.officernd.com/v1.0-Hybrid/reference/get_bookings:
  - Pagination uses required query parameter $limit to define result count, with optional
    $next and $prev string parameters serving as page pointers for navigating forward
    and backward through results. Refer to the Paging section for complete pagination
    rules.
