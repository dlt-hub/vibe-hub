- information_source; https://docs.myq-solution.com/en/rad/v4/authentication-methods-1:
  - 'MyQ REST API uses OAuth2 with three grant types: Login Info Grant, Client Credentials
    Grant, and Authorization Code Grant. Access requires an access token with appropriate
    scopes (space-separated list) granted for the requested resource; scopes limit
    token access to permissions already defined in MyQ and must be verified in the
    access_token response. Specific scope requirements per endpoint are documented
    on the Scopes page.'
- information_source; https://docs.myq-solution.com/en/rad/v4/authentication-methods-2:
  - 'The API uses OAuth2 with two grant types: Login Info Grant and Client Credentials
    Grant. Access tokens are required with specific scopes (space-separated list)
    to access endpoints; scopes must be checked in the access_token response and are
    documented per endpoint on the Scopes page. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens
    and do not grant permissions beyond what the user already has in MyQ.'
- information_source; https://docs.myq-solution.com/en/rad/v4/external-authentication-api:
  - The External Authentication API uses HTTP Basic authentication. The 'Authorization'
    header must contain 'Basic' followed by a base64-encoded string of 'username:password'.
    The endpoint, username, and password are configured in MyQ settings under User
    Authentication in the External Authentication section. Requests are made via GET
    with loginType and loginValue query parameters.
- information_source; https://docs.myq-solution.com/en/rad/v4/generate-pin:
  - REST API uses OAuth2 client credentials grant type with Bearer token authentication.
    The access token must be obtained from the auth endpoint and passed in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer %access_token%". The application requires the "users" scope
    to be granted in MyQ Settings under External Systems. The Content-Type header
    must be set to application/json.
- information_source; https://docs.myq-solution.com/en/rad/v4/getting-started-with-the-rest-api:
  - To retrieve an authentication token, POST to /api/auth/token with a JSON body
    containing grant_type set to "client_credentials", scope listing required permissions
    (e.g., "jobs offline.access"), client_id, and client_secret obtained from the
    REST API application settings. The response includes an access_token with token_type
    "Bearer" that must be provided at any other API endpoint, likely in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The token expires in 1800 seconds and includes a refresh_token
    for renewal.
