auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.monicahq.com/api:
  - OAuth 2 authentication is supported via two methods. First, you can send an OAuth
    2 token in a header. Second, you can use OAuth2 Key/Secret credentials. The documentation
    references these authentication sections but does not provide specific details
    on header names, parameter names, or implementation steps in the provided excerpt.
  - 'The API requires authentication for all requests. Two authentication methods
    are supported: OAuth 2 Bearer token sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN", or OAuth2 Key/Secret for server-to-server scenarios using
    registered applications. The OAuth2 Key/Secret method requires registering an
    application in the Monica instance first, and the client secret must never be
    exposed to users.'

  - OAuth 2 authentication is supported via two methods. First, you can send an OAuth
    2 token in the Authorization header as a bearer token. Second, you can use OAuth2
    Key/Secret credentials. All API requests must be authenticated; the API base URL
    is https://app.monicahq.com/api (or your custom instance URL/api). Requests should
    include the appropriate OAuth credentials in the Authorization header.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods. First, OAuth 2 Token authentication
    sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token: use the header "Authorization:
    Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN". Second, OAuth2 Key/Secret for server-to-server scenarios,
    which requires registering an application in your Monica instance to obtain client
    credentials. All requests to the API require authentication.'

  - Authorization header with bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your access token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.monicahq.com/api:
  - Requests return paginated results with a default page size of 10 items. Use the
    `?page` query parameter to specify which page to retrieve (omitting it returns
    page 1), and optionally use `?limit` to set a custom page size up to 100 items.
- information_source; https://www.monicahq.com/api/overview:
  - Requests that return multiple items are paginated to 10 items by default. Use
    the `?page` query parameter to specify pages (omitting it returns the first page),
    and optionally use `?limit` query parameter to set a custom page size up to 100
    items. Stop paginating when fewer items than the page size are returned or no
    more items exist.
- information_source; https://www.monicahq.com/api/activities:
  - 'Pagination uses a query parameter page (default 1) in the URL. Response includes
    meta fields: current_page, last_page, per_page, total, from, to. Navigate using
    first, last, prev, next URLs in the links object, stopping when next is null.'
  - Pagination uses limit (page size, integer) and page (page number, integer) query
    parameters. Response includes data array with activity objects.
  - Pagination uses query parameter page (default 1) to request pages. Response includes
    links object with first, last, prev, next URLs and meta object with current_page,
    last_page, per_page, total, from, to fields. Stop paginating when next is null.
