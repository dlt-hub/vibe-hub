auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/microsoft.com/graph-beta/1.0.1/openapi.json:
  - Acquire an OAuth Access token by sending credentials in the request body to authorize
    Azure AD provisioning service. The endpoint requires a servicePrincipal-id path
    parameter and accepts a credentials array in the JSON request body for token acquisition.
  - An Azure Logic Apps system-assigned managed identity is required to call this
    API. The documentation does not specify explicit header names, parameter formats,
    or token acquisition details for this managed identity authentication.
  - Microsoft Graph API requires OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication. Include the
    access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for all requests
    to protected resources like calendars and events.
  - Only teachers can perform this operation.
  - The calling user must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced and must
    be running the request in a session where they were challenged for MFA. This is
    a requirement for creating role assignment schedule requests, though the documentation
    does not specify exact header names or token formats for standard API authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/microsoft.com/graph-beta/1.0.1/openapi.json:
  - '@odata.nextLink is used for pagination. The response contains a nextLinkName
    field set to @odata.nextLink, and the operationName listMore indicates that subsequent
    paginated requests use this link value to retrieve additional results.'
  - Paginated list responses use the @odata.nextLink field to provide the URL for
    retrieving the next page of results. Use the value from @odata.nextLink as the
    request URL for subsequent requests via the listMore operation.
  - Pagination is controlled by top (limit) and skip (offset) query parameters. The
    count parameter indicates whether to include total count in response. Results
    are ordered via $orderby query parameter.
  - Pagination is implemented using the OData nextLink pattern. The response includes
    an @odata.nextLink field; use its value as the request URL for the next page.
    Continue paginating until @odata.nextLink is absent from the response.
  - Pagination is implemented using the `@odata.nextLink` field in responses. To paginate,
    use the URL provided in the `@odata.nextLink` response field to fetch the next
    page of results. Stop paginating when `@odata.nextLink` is not present in the
    response.
