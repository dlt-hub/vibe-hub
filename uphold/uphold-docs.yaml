  - 'The API uses OAuth2 with the client credentials grant type for authentication.
    To obtain an access token, call the Request OAuth2 Token endpoint with valid client
    ID and client secret. Authenticate subsequent requests by adding the `Authorization:
    Bearer {accessToken}` HTTP header. For organization-wide clients with the `core.users:act-on-behalf-of`
    scope, include the `X-On-Behalf-Of: user {userId}` HTTP header to act on behalf
    of a specific user. Single-user clients are pre-associated with a specific user
    and require no additional header.'
