notes:
- Technical writing blog and API documentation course by Tom Johnson
- OpenWeatherMap API key is required for access
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Although many other aspects of API documentation might seem more pressing, such
  as configuring your publishing toolchain, writing is still a core task technical
  writers do when creating API documentation.
- Publishing technical documentation typically involves following docs-as-code tools
  and workflows.
- For open source projects, GitHub is frequently used to manage content.
- Measuring API documentation quality and tracking its improvement is a frequent management
  request that’s challenging to fulfill.
- User surveys and satisfaction scores offer some insight, but they shouldn’t be the
  only evaluation tools.
- The reading pace is one book a month.
- Meetings take place online through Google Meet, with recordings posted afterwards.
- Monthly meetings are usually the third Sunday of the month at 10am Pacific Time.
- The Slack workspace is used to chat, share info or other thoughts.
- LLM-based AI tools can help you with documentation-related activities.
- This series started with the realization that smartphones were fragmenting my attention
  span, so I abandoned my smartphone for six weeks.
- During that time, I rediscovered books and reading.
- The greatest outcome of my basic phone experiment was to rekindle interest and enjoyment
  in reading books.
- Ask a technical writer what they do, and the most common response is that tech writers
  “simplify complexity.”
- This API does not require authentication.

- AI tools can help transform highly technical gobbled-gook into readable text.
- The meetings are usually the third Sunday of the month at 10am Pacific Time.
- The reading pace is one book a month, with meetings on the third Sunday of each
  month at 10am Pacific Time.
- The collaborative newsletter's content seems to be stuck in a model of mutual non-engagement.
- Explores tech comm trends that I've either followed or forgotten
- Focuses on systems thinking as a discipline that emphasizes big picture thinking
- Senge's book applies systems thinking to learning organizations.
- Requires setup of connected app in API
- Tech writers often operate on the periphery of teams.
- Working remotely may lead to feelings of isolation and unproductiveness.
- Git can replace the need for a CMS or CCMS to manage and collaborate on content,
  provided that the Git workflows don’t exclude those you’re trying to collaborate
  with.
- Tech writers usually plug into various Scrum teams, but documentation groups can
  also manage documentation using their documentation Scrums as well.
- Partially allocated resources like tech writers should understand the mechanics
  of scrum to better plug in with engineering teams, but they shouldn’t expect to
  participate as full-fledged members of these same engineering scrum teams.
- DITA was frustrating due to limitations on content management and output control.
- Security practices made WordPress almost an impossible option in the enterprise.
- Technical writers face unique requirements for content authoring and publishing.
- Designing quick reference guides tapped into my creative side, and I found myself
  interested in layout and design.
- Faceted filtering allows users to narrow down content by various options.
- HATs are still popular, with more options that are cloud-based.
- HATs aren’t the primary tool choice for API documentation.
- Content should be shared on appropriate social media channels to build awareness.
- Content shared via email may have low engagement.
- Tech writing is about more than tools and technology.
- It takes a couple of hours for the OpenWeatherMap API key to become active.
- 'Last updated: Oct 10, 2024'
- Ramping up on API documentation, developing a portfolio of API documentation writing
  samples, and completing all the activities in this course will require a lot of
  time and effort.
- No survey has focused exclusively on trends within developer documentation.
- The OpenWeatherMap API is easy to use, free, and stable.
- API key should be included as a query parameter.
- API key can also be passed in the header.
- 'If you''re using Windows, note the following formatting requirements when using
  curl: Use double quotes in the Windows command line. (Windows doesn’t support single
  quotes.) Don’t use backslashes (`\`) to separate lines.'
- curl provides a generic, language-agnostic way to demonstrate HTTP requests and
  responses.
- GET is used by default with curl requests.
- JSON is the most common format for responses from REST APIs.
- Some APIs return information in both JSON and XML.
- Contains information about surfing conditions, including the surf height, water
  temperature, wind, and tide.
- Also provides an overall recommendation about whether to go surfing.
- curl is language agnostic, so it’s not specific to one particular programming language.
- Some APIs put the response in a right column so you can see it while also looking
  at the resource description and parameters.
- A lot of APIs have modeled their design after Stripe’s.
- If your layout uses three columns, your middle column will have some narrow constraints
  that don’t leave much room for screenshots and code examples.
- When you click a link in the 'Examples of API calls' section, you see the response
  returned in the browser.
- This dynamic approach works well for GET requests that return public information.
- Responses are generated dynamically based on API calls to a test system.
- OpenAPI specification is available in a Github repository
- Endpoints are defined under the 'paths' key
- Stoplight simplifies the authoring of a highly technical syntax that is often challenging
  to make valid.
- Stoplight’s visual modeling tools eliminate the need to be familiar with the format
  of the OpenAPI specification.
- Stoplight is one of the sponsors of this site.
- All parameters are optional, but you must select at least one parameter.
- The Petstore is a functioning API, and you have actually created a pet.
- CORS issues may occur if running locally without a server
- To view local OpenAPI file, use Python's SimpleHTTPServer
- CORS is a security measure that websites implement to make sure other scripts and
  processes cannot take their content through requests from remote servers.
- SwaggerHub provides a complete solution for designing, managing, and publishing
  documentation for your API.
- While the Swagger UI display is designed to be responsive, the collapse/expand sections
  in the Model views still have overflow issues in responsive views.
- When you start pushing your API documentation into another source file, you end
  up splitting your single source of truth into multiple sources.
- Redocly provides a variety of tools for working with API docs.
- Redocly's approach to simplifying the author experience with OpenAPI aligns with
  the developer audience.
- This tutorial is a brief exposure to Redocly’s tools only.
- You can customize how files are split using options like --separator to control
  path separators.
- Redocly's approach to simplifying the author experience with OpenAPI is based on
  the idea that API documentation should be treated as code.
- The `$ref` syntax used to reference external files is standard in OpenAPI, but not
  all tools support working with split files.
- API key to authorize requests. (If you don't have an API key, get one at https://openweathermap.org/.
  See https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_get_auth_keys.html for details.)
- Learning the OpenAPI specification will take some time.
- There are many other display frameworks besides Swagger UI that can parse and display
  information in an OpenAPI specification document.
- Uses API key to authorize requests.
- API key to authorize requests.
- The externalDocs object lets you link to external documentation.
- The webhooks object allows you to describe out-of-band requests that your service
  might send to other applications.
- The jsonSchemaDialect field declares the default dialect for all Schema Objects
  within your OpenAPI document.
- Developers may need to provide access to a test server or sample code.
- Without a test environment, it will be difficult to make any progress in testing
  your instructions.
- Setting up a test system can require a lot of initial investigation.
- If a developer is knee-deep in sprint tasks and heavily backlogged, he or she may
  not have time to help you properly get set up.
- Submitting apps into the Appstore triggered in-app purchases tag automatically.
- Device targeting for Fire TV apps didn't work correctly.
- API rate limiting and thresholds
- Rate limits determine how frequently you can call a particular endpoint.
- Different tiers correspond to different capabilities or rate limits with the API.
- You need a verified sender identity to make it work.
- Documenting code is challenging due to non-linear structure and varying audience
  technical levels.
- Technical writers often lack familiarity with programming languages needed for documentation.
- Sample apps are critical to writing good docs
- Getting approval to publish sample apps is not an easy task
- Code simplicity versus more robust functionality is a tradeoff
- API key is required for authentication.
- Rate limits apply to API usage.
- Technical writing intersects closely with usability like no other domain on technical
  projects.
- The main usability task of technical writing is to simplify complexity.
- Few of us get opportunities to regularly observe users.
- Writing requires a lot of mental energy.
- Editing requires a fresh perspective.
- Documentation is integrated into the engineer's workflow, allowing developers to
  write documentation in Markdown files in the same repository as their code.
- Markdown handles most of the syntax I normally use
- Some people object to Markdown due to the inconsistency across Markdown flavors
- Collaborating on docs in Git can be challenging, especially when working on the
  same files.
- Initial content development might be better suited for platforms like Google Docs.
- GitHub Pages has a recommended limit of 1GB for source repositories.
- Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
- GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
- GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.
- GitHub wikis have limited branding and open access on the web.
- No advanced styling or interactive features are available.
- Unless you set up automatic GitHub authentication, you will be prompted for your
  GitHub username and password.
- Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a
  personal access token instead.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of GitHub OAuth application
- Requires a valid GitHub account and OAuth application setup.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of OAuth App in GitHub
- Some APIs may have rate limits
- Requires OAuth application setup in GitHub.
- Using GitHub's API requires proper authentication setup.
- Collaborators need write access to commit changes.
- The only drawback with CloudCannon is that your company must allow you to host documentation
  content on GitHub.
- Continuous delivery means that when you commit a change to your Git repo, the server
  automatically rebuilds your Jekyll site.
- Blobr is one of the sponsors of my site.
- Moving content out of the legacy CMS was challenging.
- Implementing new processes while still supporting the old was difficult.
- Integration with internal Git repositories for version control
- Build pipeline for Jekyll project from server
- Making good documentation is hard, and given the questions and onboarding challenges,
  I realized just how much the content needed to be simplified and fine-tuned.
- California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey,
  Ohio, and Pennsylvania are promising areas for API documentation jobs for technical
  writers.
- Finding the right project can be challenging, but it is critical to your portfolio
  and your success in breaking into API documentation.
- The ideal open-source API project should involve a REST API, have some documentation
  needs, not be too technical, and be active with a somewhat recent commit.
- Native library APIs are installed locally and do not use HTTP protocol.
- Includes both short and long descriptions in the documentation.
- Elements marked as private are not included in Javadoc unless specifically selected.
- Doxygen works highly similarly to Javadoc, except that it can process more languages
  (Java, C++, C#, and more).
- Doxygen is most commonly used with C++.
- This process protects your current workload from becoming too frantic/heavy/scattered.
- Small requests can usually be made in a few days or less.
- Small doc requests can be prioritized and weighted similar to other projects (e.g.,
  low, medium, or high priority).
- Ensure legal signoff for SDK releases
- Security review required to avoid vulnerabilities
- QA signoff necessary for SDK testing
- Handling feedback post-release presents many new challenges.
- Most feedback I’ve seen in comments rarely goes beyond identifying simple issues.
- The best time to review your docs is before release, not after.
- External contributors may introduce unvetted content into the document repository.
- Git can be a complexity factor for contributors unfamiliar with specific workflows.
- Company culture towards documentation isn’t easy to change, and just like people
  don’t change overnight, company culture doesn’t transform overnight either.
- Sending reports builds confidence with the employer that you will complete the work
  on time and within budget.
- The initial reports might take a while, but once you’ve created a few, you’ll have
  an established format and routine.
- Sending documentation status reports can help foster trust and awareness with your
  business stakeholders.
- Meeting notes provide a natural story foundation to build around.
- Meeting notes are often more interesting to read.
- Sometimes surfacing issues is a good thing, as it forces the issues into open daylight
  where some action can be taken.
- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries
  with your existing data.
- Learning GraphQL is a great way to specialize and stand out as a technical writer.
- API key required for accessing the Eventbrite API.
- Event ID is required as a path parameter.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- Calling the API by city ID will provide the most precise location results.
- 'Resource description: wordy. should be more concise and action-oriented'
- Surfreport probably shouldn’t be capitalized
- Recorded API documentation workshop in Menlo Park, California.
- The cost for a Q&A post is $750.
- The cost for inline text snippets to appear on the API doc site is $1,800 per year.
