auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/apideck.com/vault/9.3.0/openapi.json:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used, with required fields handled through Hosted
    Vault or the Vault API. Additionally, API key and application ID authentication
    are required via the security scheme.
  - OAuth2 authentication is used. The auth entity includes auth_type set to "oauth2",
    with consumer_id identifying the user and state indicating authorization status
    ("authorized").
  - 'The API requires two mandatory headers for authentication: x-apideck-app-id (your
    Unify application id, available at https://app.apideck.com/api-keys) and x-apideck-consumer-id
    (the customer id stored in Apideck Vault, which can be a user id, account id,
    device id, or similar entity). An optional x-apideck-raw boolean header is available
    for debugging. Header names are case insensitive per RFC 7230.'
  - 'The Vault API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token (format: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY). You also
    need to provide an application ID, obtained from the Apideck Dashboard after signing
    up. For OAuth integrations, you must retrieve and configure client_id and client_secret
    for each integration you want to activate, and register your redirect URI (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback)
    in your app''s settings.'
  - 'To use Hosted Vault, authentication requires an API key sent as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header. Additionally, two custom headers are required: X-APIDECK-CONSUMER-ID
    containing the consumer ID, and X-APIDECK-APP-ID containing the application ID.
    These credentials are needed when making POST requests to create a session at
    the Vault API endpoint.'
