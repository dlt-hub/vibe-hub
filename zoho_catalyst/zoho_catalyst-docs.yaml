auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/en/api/introduction/overview-and-prerequisites/:
  - API key authentication is required via the Authorization header using the format
    "Zoho-oauthtoken {oauth_token}", where oauth_token is a valid Zoho OAuth2 token.
    The scope ZohoCatalyst.automationtesting.execute is required for this endpoint.
    Optionally, the CATALYST-ORG header with an org_id value can be included for organization-level
    access.
  - Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 tokens. Send the token in the Authorization header
    with the format "Zoho-oauthtoken {token_value}". The required scope is ZohoCatalyst.buckets.objects.READ
    for reading object details.
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 tokens. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Zoho-oauthtoken {token_value}" where token_value is your OAuth access token.
    The scope required for this operation is ZohoCatalyst.buckets.objects.DELETE.
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 with Zoho. The Authorization header must contain the
    value "Zoho-oauthtoken {oauth_token}" where oauth_token is your Zoho OAuth access
    token. The required scope for this operation is ZohoCatalyst.cron.CREATE. Optionally,
    you can include the CATALYST-ORG header with an org_id value to specify the organization
    context.
  - 'Authentication uses Zoho OAuth tokens passed in the Authorization header with
    the scheme "Zoho-oauthtoken" followed by a token value. Include the header Authorization:
    Zoho-oauthtoken <token> in all requests to this endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/en/api/introduction/overview-and-prerequisites/:
  - Pagination uses max_rows query parameter to specify the number of rows per page
    (for example 100), and next_token query parameter to pass the pagination token
    from the previous response to fetch the next page. The API response contains a
    next_token field that should be passed in the subsequent request; stop paginating
    when next_token is not returned or is null.
  - Pagination uses optional continuation_token parameter in the request and returns
    truncated boolean with next_continuation_token in response. When truncated is
    true, pass the returned next_continuation_token as continuation_token in the next
    request to fetch additional objects. max_keys parameter controls the number of
    objects returned per request.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters max_versions and continuation_token.
    The response includes is_truncated boolean and next_continuation_token string;
    pass next_continuation_token as continuation_token in the subsequent request to
    fetch the next page, and stop when is_truncated is false.
  - Pagination uses start and end query parameters. start specifies the starting file
    position (must be greater than 0), and end specifies the number of files to retrieve
    with a maximum of 200. For example, to get files 201-300, set start=201 and end=100.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with query parameters next_token (optional,
    obtained from previous response) and max_rows (optional, defaults to 200 rows
    per page). The response includes a next_token field when more rows are available;
    absence of next_token indicates the final page.
