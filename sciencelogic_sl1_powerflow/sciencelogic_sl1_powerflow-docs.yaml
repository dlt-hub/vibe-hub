auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sciencelogic.com/restorepoint/api/5-6/api.html:
  - 'API requests require one of three authentication methods: Cookie, Token, or Permissions-based
    auth with UpdateSysadmin role. Token-based auth likely uses a bearer token in
    the Authorization header or a token parameter. Cookie-based auth uses session
    cookies. Permissions are role-based, requiring UpdateSysadmin privilege to delete
    historic jobs.'
  - 'API requests require one of three authentication methods: Cookie-based authentication,
    Token-based authentication, or permission-based access control. Specific endpoints
    enforce required permissions such as UpdateSysadmin for deletion operations or
    ViewLogs for retrieving agent information. The exact header names, parameter names,
    and token format are not specified in this documentation excerpt.'
  - API tokens can be authenticated via Cookie, Token header, or Permissions-based
    authorization. The Token authentication method uses a LoginToken field (e.g.,
    "ABCD1234") that is obtained after user login. Permissions are role-based, with
    specific permission IDs controlling access to operations like ModifyOwnTokens
    and ModifyAllTokens. Tokens are managed per user and require appropriate role
    permissions to modify.
  - Authentication can be provided via Cookie or Token. Token-based authentication
    is used by sending credentials in the Authorization header or as a query parameter,
    while Cookie-based authentication uses HTTP cookies set in requests. Exact header
    names, parameter names, and token format details are not specified in this documentation
    excerpt.
  - Authentication for this API uses either Cookie or Token. For Token authentication,
    send credentials via an Authorization header or as a query parameter named token.
    For Cookie authentication, include session credentials in the request cookies.
    Exact header/parameter names and token format details are not specified in this
    documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sciencelogic.com/restorepoint/api/5-6/api.html:
  - Offset-based pagination is used with query parameters offset (integer >= 0, default
    0) and limit (integer 1-500, default 50). The offset parameter specifies items
    to skip, and limit specifies items to return per request. Increment offset by
    the limit value to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Offset-based pagination is used. The offset query parameter (integer, >= 0, default
    0) specifies how many items to skip before collecting results.
  - 'Offset-limit pagination: use offset (integer, >= 0, default 0) and limit (integer,
    1-500, default 50) query parameters to paginate through commands. offset specifies
    items to skip, limit specifies items per page.'
  - 'Offset-limit pagination: use query parameters offset (integer >= 0, default 0)
    and limit (integer 1-500, default 50) to request pages. Response includes offset,
    limit, total (total item count), and data array; stop when returned items are
    fewer than limit or offset exceeds total.'
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes offset
    (current position), limit (items per page, default 50), and total (total count
    of items). To paginate, increment offset by limit value and repeat the request
    until offset plus returned items count reaches total.
