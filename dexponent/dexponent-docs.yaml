notes:
- Never share your private key with anyone.
- Keep your operating system and all software updated.
- Yield simulation does not automatically modify stETH balances.
- Ensure the Lido stETH contract address is valid and up to date.
- 'Optimized Yield: You will direct TAO allocations to the top 10 performing subnets,
  as determined by current validator reward metrics on Bittensor.'
- 'Decentralised Validator Management: As a farm owner, you will be able to adjust
  your validator allocations based on real time subnet performance.'
- 'Transparent Yield Monitoring: You will have access to detailed analytics that track
  both individual validator stakes and aggregate yield performance.'
- 'Seamless Integration: By using the standard FarmStrategy interface within the Dexponent
  Protocol, you will ensure compatibility and operational smoothness.'
- This strategy gives you better use of your stablecoins, but like any leveraged position,
  it comes with risks. That’s why we’re keeping it on testnet for now.
- The strategy simulates a fixed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of approximately 6%
  based on the net collateral.
- 'Simplicity and Transparency: By simply holding a supported memecoin, this strategy
  abstracts away the complexity of traditional yield farming mechanisms.'
- 'Attractive Yield Simulation: The strategy simulates a fixed 15% Annual Percentage
  Yield (APY) on the held memecoin.'
- 'Community-Driven Engagement: By leveraging a popular memecoin, the strategy taps
  into an existing and active token community.'
- 'Reduced Operational Risk: This strategy does not interact with external DeFi protocols
  or deploy capital into third-party smart contracts.'
- 'Seamless Protocol Integration: The memecoin-based strategy is fully compliant with
  the Dexponent Protocol’s FarmStrategy interface.'
- This strategy serves as a testnet demonstration of automated liquidity provisioning
  and yield farming using familiar assets ETH and USDC allowing you to observe how
  DeFi mechanics work in a safe, simulated environment.
- The system is designed to provide a deeper, risk adjusted evaluation of DeFi yield
  strategies referred to as Farms moving beyond superficial metrics like APY or APR.
- Eliminates reliance on self-reported metrics
- Provides a verifiable, trust-minimized source of truth for strategy performance
errors:
- Transaction failures usually stem from insufficient ETH for gas fees or issues with
  your private key.
- 'Unauthorized access: Confirm that the correct Farm contract address is set.'
