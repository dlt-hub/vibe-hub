auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.sohamkamani.com/golang/oauth/:
  - GitHub API requires bearer token authentication sent via the Authorization header.
    The token is passed as "token <access_token>" in the Authorization header, along
    with an Accept header specifying the API version as "application/vnd.github.v3+json".
    The access token is obtained from the OAuth2 flow and provided as a query parameter
    in the callback URL.
  - 'GitHub OAuth2 authentication requires three steps: (1) redirect users to GitHub''s
    authorization endpoint, (2) exchange the authorization code for an access token
    via POST to https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token with client_id, client_secret,
    and code parameters, (3) use the access token to call GitHub APIs. The client_id
    and client_secret must be registered OAuth app credentials, and the authorization
    code is obtained from the redirect URL query parameter named code.'
  - The documentation describes a GitHub OAuth2 authorization code flow. To obtain
    an access token, make a POST request to https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
    with query parameters client_id, client_secret, and code. Set the Accept header
    to application/json. The client_id and client_secret are obtained during GitHub
    app registration, and the code parameter comes from the OAuth authorization redirect.
