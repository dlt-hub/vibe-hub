auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.subscribepro.com/technical/rest-api/:
  - Access tokens are required and passed as query parameters named access_token in
    API requests. The base URL for all calls is https://api.subscribepro.com/ and
    rate limiting is 600 requests per minute per IP address.
- information_source; https://docs.subscribepro.com/technical/rest-api/pagination/:
  - The API requires an access token passed as a query parameter named `access_token`.
    Include this parameter in your request URL, for example `?access_token=xyz`, to
    authenticate with the Subscribe Pro API.
- information_source; https://docs.subscribepro.com/technical/rest-api/authenticating-with-curl/:
  - 'Authentication requires a Client ID and Client Secret obtained from System >
    API Clients in your Subscribe Pro Environment. Two methods are supported: OAuth2
    (client credentials grant) and HTTP Basic Authentication. For OAuth2, POST to
    https://api.subscribepro.com/oauth/v2/token with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id, and client_secret parameters to receive an access_token (86-character
    alphanumeric string, 3600 second expiry) and refresh_token. The access_token is
    then used as a bearer token for API requests.'
- information_source; https://docs.subscribepro.com/technical/hosted-widgets/my-subscriptions-widget/implementing/:
  - Access tokens obtained from the `/oauth/v2/token` endpoint must be passed as the
    `apiAccessToken` parameter in the widget configuration object. The `environmentKey`
    (from the `spreedly_environment_key` field in the token response) and `customerId`
    are also required configuration values that should be determined server-side and
    injected into the page template.
  - Subscribe Pro uses OAuth2 with client credentials grant type for server-side authentication.
    Call the /oauth/v2/token endpoint with HTTP Basic Auth using client_id and client_secret,
    passing grant_type=client_credentials, scope=widget, and either customer_id or
    customer_email as form data to obtain a bearer token valid for 3600 seconds scoped
    to an individual customer.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.subscribepro.com/technical/rest-api/pagination/:
  - 'Use query parameters `since_id` (optional integer, default null) to specify the
    starting entity ID and `count` (optional integer, range 1-999, default 30) to
    set page size. Pagination is offset-based: use the ID of the last returned record
    as the next `since_id` value to fetch subsequent pages.'
  - V3 API endpoints support pagination using query parameters page (integer, default
    1) and itemsPerPage (integer, range 1-999, default 30). The default page size
    is 30 records per page. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page
    parameter value.
