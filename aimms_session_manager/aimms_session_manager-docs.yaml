auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.aimms.com/cloud/rest-api.html:
  - 'Requests to the AIMMS PRO REST API are authenticated using API Keys generated
    from the PRO Portal Account settings page. Each API Key must be assigned scopes
    to define its permissions and an expiration date.


    To authenticate, include the API Key in requests to the PRO REST API. The exact
    header name, parameter name, or location for sending the API Key is not specified
    in this documentation excerpt. Users generate API Keys via the PRO Portal by clicking
    Add API Key and specifying a key name, expiration date, and scopes. The documentation
    indicates that scopes are used to control authorization but does not complete
    the explanation of available scopes in this section.'
  - The REST API requires an API key to be sent as a custom header named "apikey"
    in requests. The exact header name must match what is defined in the API specification.
    This applies to operations on applications and other resources managed through
    the PRO REST API.
- information_source; https://documentation.aimms.com/cloud/session-manager.html:
  - Requests to the session-manager API are authenticated using an API Key with session
    scope. The API Key must be sent as an Authorization header with Bearer token format.
    The service endpoint is https://[account-name].aimms.cloud/pro/session-manager/v1,
    and all requests require the API Key credential to be included in the request
    headers for authentication and authorization.
- information_source; https://documentation.aimms.com/cloud/tasks.html:
  - 'API keys are required for authentication, with the "Task" scope needed specifically
    for task-related operations. Authorization is tied to user permissions on the
    AIMMS App: Create/Interrupt/Delete operations require Read and Execute permissions,
    while Retrieve operations require Read permissions only.'
- information_source; https://documentation.aimms.com/dataexchange/rest.html:
  - Using OAuth2 for API authorization requires support in the Data Exchange library.
    API keys are added to API-specific headers. For OAuth2 implementation, you would
    need to follow the OAuth2 authorization protocol (https://oauth.net/2/), but specific
    details on headers, parameters, token acquisition, or credential placement are
    not provided in this documentation excerpt.
