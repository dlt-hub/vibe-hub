notes:
- The Directory REST API should be used on the Directory Proxy Server only when the
  underlying backend servers for that proxy are Ping Directory Servers.
- For security reasons, the PingDirectory REST API never returns the userPassword
  or authPassword properties in a response.
- Requests can be authenticated using either Basic authentication or Bearer token.
- When bearer token authentication is used, the access token used must include a scope
  that the directory service is configured to accept.
- The PingDirectory REST API never returns the userPassword or authPassword properties
  in a response.
- PingDirectory version 10 or higher is required to use the authenticate endpoint.
- The intermediate client request control may be included in any type of request.
- It can be used to request that the operation be processed with an alternative authorization
  identity.
- Uses JSON as the data exchange format.
- All endpoints return data using the HAL+JSON content type.
- This call sends cookies. Consult your browser's instruction manual to properly configure.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_FAILED: Entry violates the Directory Server schema configuration.'
- 'Status: This error typically means either your URL is not constructed properly
  or the server is not configured for CORS requests. Check that the URL in the Settings
  tab above is what you expect.'
