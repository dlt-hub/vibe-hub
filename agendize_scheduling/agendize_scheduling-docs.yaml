  - 'Agendize uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Redirect users to https://api.agendize.com/o/oauth2/authorize
    with client_id and redirect_uri parameters. After user authorization, exchange
    the authorization code for tokens by POSTing to https://api.agendize.com/o/oauth2/token
    with client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, code, and grant_type=authorization_code.
    The response contains access_token (for API requests), refresh_token (for renewal),
    expire_in (validity duration), and token_type=Bearer. Use the access_token in
    subsequent API requests with Authorization: Bearer header.'
  - Agendize uses OAuth2 with Bearer tokens. To refresh an expired access token, POST
    to https://api.agendize.com/o/oauth2/token with grant_type=refresh_token, client_id,
    client_secret, and refresh_token in the request body. The response includes a
    new access_token (Bearer type), refresh_token, and expire_in (validity duration
    in seconds). Use the access_token in subsequent API requests.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access
    token by POSTing to https://api.agendize.com/o/oauth2/token with client_id, client_secret,
    grant_type=authorization_code, code, and redirect_uri. The response includes access_token,
    expire_in (86400 seconds), refresh_token, and token_type=Bearer. Access tokens
    expire after 24 hours; renew by POSTing client_id, client_secret, refresh_token,
    and grant_type=refresh_token to the same endpoint. Use the access_token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for API requests.
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2/resellers/reference/accounts/index.jsp:
  - Authentication is required to execute these requests. Refer to the Authentication
    documentation at /v2/authentication.jsp for details on how to authenticate. The
    documentation does not specify the exact authentication scheme, headers, parameters,
    or credentials format in this excerpt.
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is supported with two grant types: refresh_token (default)
    or client_credentials. For refresh_token flow, provide oauth2Auth.clientId, oauth2Auth.refreshToken,
    oauth2Auth.authUrl, oauth2Auth.accessTokenUrl, and oauth2Auth.scope. For client_credentials
    flow, provide oauth2Auth.clientId and oauth2Auth.accessTokenUrl. The access token
    is used for HTTP OAuth2 authentication on the destination watch address.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2/scheduling/reference/services/index.jsp:
  - The List endpoint uses syncToken-based pagination. The optional query parameter
    syncToken is obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned in the previous response
    to retrieve the next page of results. The response contains an items array with
    Service resources.
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2/resellers/reference/accounts/index.jsp:
  - Use offset and limit query parameters for pagination. offset specifies the starting
    position (default 0), and limit specifies the number of results per page (default
    50, max 100). Response includes total field indicating total number of results;
    stop when offset plus returned items equals total.
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2/clients/reference/index.jsp:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: `maxResults` (integer, maximum clients
    per page, default unlimited) and `resultsOffset` (integer, starting index). Response
    includes `totalCount` field for total results and `nextSyncToken` field for subsequent
    requests to track pagination state.'
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2.1/scheduling/reference/companies/index.jsp:
  - The List endpoint uses token-based pagination with a `syncToken` query parameter
    obtained from the `nextSyncToken` field in the previous response. Include `syncToken`
    from the prior request's `nextSyncToken` to retrieve the next page of results.
- information_source; https://developers.agendize.com/v2.1/scheduling/reference/services/index.jsp:
  - The List endpoint uses cursor-based pagination via the `syncToken` optional query
    parameter. Obtain `syncToken` from the `nextSyncToken` field in the previous response
    and pass it in the next request to retrieve the next page of results.
