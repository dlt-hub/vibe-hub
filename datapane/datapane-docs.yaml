notes:
- Matplotlib plots are not interactive in Datapane apps, but are saved as SVGs so
  can be viewed at high fidelity.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Plotly's library enables interactive, publication-quality graphs
- Conda sometimes installs an older version of Datapane.
- We generally recommend installing via conda over pip on Windows as it's easier to
  install all the required dependencies.
- Generating a Report is somewhat similar to generating static-site generator for
  HTML, like Hugo or Jekyll
- Although standalone and serverless, Internet access is required to retrieve Datapane
  front-end libraries needed to render the report
- There are currently six styling properties supported
- Supported video, audio and image formats depend on the browser used to view the
  report.
- Select expects a list of Blocks, but if a Python object is passed, Datapane will
  attempt to convert it automatically.
- Report uploading (i.e. dp.upload_report()) to Datapane Cloud is no longer supported.
