auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.port.io/api-reference/port-api/:
  - Tokens are valid for 3 hours and must be included as a bearer token in requests.
    Only one active token can exist per API credential set at a time; subsequent token
    generation requests with the same credentials return the existing active token
    if not expired. Include retry logic to handle token expiration errors.
- information_source; https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/api/:
  - 'API uses OAuth2-style token-based authentication. Obtain an access token by POST
    to the auth endpoint with clientId and clientSecret in the JSON body, then include
    the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {accessToken}" for subsequent
    API requests.


    Key details: POST endpoint is https://api.getport.io/v1/auth/access_token with
    Content-Type application/json. Request body requires clientId and clientSecret
    fields. Response contains accessToken field. Use Authorization header with value
    "Bearer {accessToken}" for authenticated requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses OAuth2 with client credentials flow. Send a POST request
    with clientId and clientSecret in the JSON body to obtain an access token, then
    include the token in subsequent API requests using the Authorization header with
    Bearer scheme (format: "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>").'
  - Authentication uses OAuth2-style bearer tokens. Obtain an access token by POST-ing
    CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to the /auth/access_token endpoint, then include the
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {accessToken}". The token response
    contains the field accessToken which should be used in subsequent API calls.
  - Authorization is Bearer token-based. Obtain an access token by sending a POST
    request to https://api.getport.io/v1/auth/access_token with JSON body containing
    clientId and clientSecret fields. Include the token in subsequent requests via
    the Authorization header as "Bearer {accessToken}".

  - 'The API supports three pagination types: offset-based using offset and limit
    query parameters, page-based using page and size query parameters, and cursor-based
    using cursor and limit query parameters. Custom parameter names can be configured,
    such as skip instead of offset, after instead of cursor, per_page instead of limit,
    or page_size instead of size, with configurable start page values.'
