notes:
- The julia_version_strict keyword argument requires at least Julia 1.12.
- The outdated keyword argument requires at least Julia 1.8.
- Specifying packages to precompile requires at least Julia 1.8.
- Timing mode requires at least Julia 1.9.
- Only packages that have been added with add can be loaded.
- A package can only be loaded once per Julia session.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The PkgTemplates package offers an easy, repeatable, and customizable way to generate
  the files for a new package.
- The app support in Pkg is currently considered experimental and some functionality
  and API may change.
- You need to manually make `~/.julia/bin` available on the PATH environment.
- The path to the julia executable used is the same as the one used to install the
  app. If this julia installation gets removed, you might need to reinstall the app.
- Registries can be added, removed, and updated from either the Pkg REPL or by using
  the functional API.
- The default registry flavor is conservative.
- Artifacts can be created locally, hosted anywhere, and automatically downloaded
  and unpacked upon installation of your Julia package.
errors:
- You must specify a valid Julia version
- Cannot find the specified app in the provided path
