notes:
- Common scenarios and solutions for using JavaScript in Dynamics 365.
- Tips for manipulating forms and fields in Dynamics 365.
- Requires a valid OAuth2 token for each request
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Dynamics 365
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You can easily configure fields to a really cool custom control in Dynamics 365
  without any sort of coding.
- Environments that can be restored are environments deleted by an administrator and
  not those deleted by the system due to license expiration and other scenarios.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Get the form type of the record to ensure you don’t load ALL scripts on every form
  load.
- Use developer tools to find dirty fields in your form.
- Set submit mode to control how you want to save the field you changed programmatically.
- Get save mode to manipulate auto-save for specific forms.
- Use form level notifications to display messages on the form.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Make sure you have a valid email address and phone number.
- Before running the Package Deployer, check the following in Advanced Find to avoid
  encountering issues during the installation.
- If the CRM environment is in Administration Mode, turning it off should fix the
  issue.
- XRMToolbox has a filtering capability in the Data Migration Tool.
- It is required to setup a Team to use Queues.
- The activities and cases inside a queue is called a queue item.
- Users can pick a queue item as needed.
- Picking a queue item updates the Worked By field/column.
- Users can route a queue item to another Queue or User.
- Users cannot route a queue item to a user who is not a member of the Queue that
  owns the queue item.
- A queue item can be delegated to another user who is not member of team.
- Releasing a picked queue item will automatically be routed back to the Queue.
- When displaying an Activity Status in queue, it will be a separate column per activity
  type unless you add a custom script.
- The requirement is to add a ribbon button so a Customer Service Agent can easily
  create a Phone Call with minimal clicks in the Unified Client Interface of Dynamics

- Ensure to trigger flow only when the Note has an attachment.
- You need to set Trigger Conditions to ensure that you are only triggering this flow
  if the Note (annotation) has an attachment (isdocument) and for a specific object
  type.
- Setting the Calendar Control will give your users a calendar view of all their activities
  marked on due date.
- Even if it's in calendar view by default, you can always revert it back as list.
- Uses JavaScript in Dynamics 365 Client API for customization.
- Scripts can be executed based on form type.
