auth_info:
- information_source; https://go2docs.graylog.org/1380099/setting_up_graylog/rest_api.html:
  - 'Graylog supports two token-based authentication methods for REST API access.
    Access tokens are created via the UI and used as the username in Basic Auth with
    the literal password "token" (e.g., Authorization: Basic base64(access_token:token)).
    Session tokens are obtained via POST request with username and password credentials,
    expire after a configured time, and can be refreshed through the user''s profile
    settings. Users need permissions users:tokenlist, users:tokencreate, and users:tokenremove
    to manage their own tokens.'

  - The Data Node REST API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication exclusively. Basic
    authentication is no longer supported.

  - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
    via the -u flag, which translates to an Authorization header with Base64-encoded
    credentials in the format "username:password". Additionally, the X-Requested-By
    header must be set to "cli".
