auth_info:
- information_source; https://redot.com/docs/:
  - API key authentication is required along with an API passphrase and request signature.
    Requests must include a timestamp header, and an API key in the appropriate header
    or parameter. A refresh token is also required for certain operations. The API
    uses signature-based authentication to validate requests.
  - API key authentication is required. Include the API key in requests; error code
    12501 indicates a missing API key.
  - API requests to the /v1/private/withdraw endpoint require bearer token authentication.
    Send the access token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer accessToken".
  - Authentication is required for this endpoint using a bearer token. Send the access
    token in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer accessToken".
  - Authentication is required for this endpoint. Use Bearer token authentication
    by including an Authorization header with the value "Bearer accessToken" in the
    request. The access token must be obtained through prior authentication before
    calling this method.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://redot.com/docs/:
  - Offset and limit pagination is used. The request parameters are offset (optional,
    starting position) and limit (optional, number of results per request). The response
    structure is not shown, so stopping conditions cannot be determined from this
    documentation.
  - Pagination limit is 20 items per page. Response includes a next boolean field
    indicating whether additional pages exist; use this to determine when to stop
    paginating.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters in the request body. The offset parameter
    specifies the starting position (default appears to be 0), and limit controls
    the number of results returned per request. Continue paginating by incrementing
    offset by the limit value until fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - Request uses query parameters offset (optional) and limit (optional) to paginate
    results. Response returns an array of open orders; use offset and limit values
    to retrieve subsequent pages by incrementing offset.
  - The /v1/private/get-deposits endpoint uses offset-limit pagination with optional
    query parameters offset and limit. The offset parameter specifies the starting
    position (default 0), and limit specifies the number of results per page. The
    response includes a data array containing deposit records; construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing offset by the limit value until fewer than limit results
    are returned.
