notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Dripping lessons to groups of learners is problematic.
- The WordPress REST API is a feature intended for WordPress developers, but it might
  be disclosing some information about your learning platform without you knowing
  about it.
