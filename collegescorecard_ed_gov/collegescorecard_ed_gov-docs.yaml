auth_info:
- information_source; https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/api-documentation/:
  - API key authentication is required, passed as a query parameter named api_key.
    The 401 Unauthorized error indicates missing or invalid API key credentials.
  - 'The API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named `api_key` in the
    request URL. For example: `https://api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard/v1/schools?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`.
    This is the only authentication mechanism described.'
  - The API uses query parameter-based API key authentication. Include your API key
    as the api_key query parameter in all requests, for example api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
    appended to the request URL.
  - The College Scorecard API uses API key authentication passed as a query parameter.
    Include your API key in all requests using the `api_key` query parameter, obtained
    by completing the registration form on the website.

  - API key authentication is required. Include your API key as a query parameter

    The API key is obtained by completing the registration process and will be emailed
    to you.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/api-documentation/:
  - Pagination uses page and per_page query parameters. The page parameter specifies
    which page to retrieve (e.g., page=2), and per_page specifies the number of results
    per page (e.g., per_page=10). The documentation does not specify default values,
    maximum limits, or response fields indicating total pages or whether more results
    exist.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (default 0) and
    per_page (default 20, maximum 100). The response includes metadata fields total,
    page, and per_page, allowing you to determine pagination state and construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the page parameter.
  - Use the `page` parameter as a query string parameter to specify the page number
    for pagination. The documentation cuts off before providing complete details on
    page numbering, response structure, or stopping conditions.
- information_source; https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/api/:
  - Paginated requests use page and page_size query parameters. The page parameter
    specifies which page to retrieve (starting from 0 or 1), and page_size controls
    how many results per page are returned. Continue requesting with incrementing
    page values until the response contains fewer results than page_size or indicates
    no more pages are available.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page and per_page. The page parameter specifies
    which page to retrieve (for example page=2), and per_page specifies the number
    of results per page (for example per_page=10). Both parameters are optional and
    used in the query string.
