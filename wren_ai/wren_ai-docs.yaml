auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.getwren.ai/cp/guide/api-access/quick-start:
  - API key authentication is required. Send your API key in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token in the format "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". The API key must be obtained
    from the Manage API Keys section and included with each request to the Wren AI
    API endpoint at https://cloud.getwren.ai/api/v1/.
  - The API requires Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" for all requests to the generate_sql endpoint
    and other authenticated endpoints.
- information_source; https://docs.getwren.ai/cp/guide/api-access/history:
  - Requests that fail at the authorization level, such as those with an invalid or
    missing API key, will not be recorded in the API history. This indicates that
    API key authentication is required to access the Wren AI API endpoints, with the
    API key being validated before requests reach the endpoints.
