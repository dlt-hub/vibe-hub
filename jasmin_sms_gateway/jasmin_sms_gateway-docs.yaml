  - Jasmin HTTP API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials must be passed as
    username and password in HTTP GET/POST requests to authenticate SMS sending and
    other operations. The exact header names and parameter formats for passing credentials
    are not specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - Username and password authentication is required for the balance endpoint. Send
    username and password as HTTP request parameters (query string or POST body) with
    parameter names "username" and "password" respectively, each up to 30 characters
    maximum.

  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials via the Authorization
    header using the format "Basic " followed by base64-encoded "username:password".
    In the example, "Zm9vOmJhcg==" decodes to "foo:bar". The endpoint is POST /secure/sendbatch
    and requires this Authorization header with each request.
