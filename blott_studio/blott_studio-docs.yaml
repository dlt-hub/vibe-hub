auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.blott.studio/blog:
  - A2A protocol supports multiple authentication methods from the OpenAPI specification
    including HTTP authentication (Basic, Bearer), API keys, and OAuth 2.0 with OpenID
    Connect. Authorization boundaries must be clearly defined to set agent permissions
    and data access limits, with external services handling sensitive data required
    to be part of the authorization boundary or in an authorized system with matching
    security levels.
  - A2A supports JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication as an alternative to traditional
    user authentication, allowing multiple concurrent API sessions. RSA key pairs
    enable secure service account authentication through public key registration and
    private key signature generation. Authorization is implemented via role-based
    access control (RBAC) where service accounts receive specific roles limiting access
    to required resources, with dynamic context-based adaptation. All data exchanges
    require encryption throughout the communication lifecycle.
  - AWS Bedrock API authentication uses bearer tokens sent in the Authorization header.
    Credentials are created via IAM's CreateServiceSpecificCredential API for the
    bedrock.amazonaws.com service, and usage is tracked through CloudTrail events
    marked with callWithBearerToken flag. The Authorization header format is "Bearer
    ${AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK}" and deletion requests require proper token credentials
    in headers along with Content-Type application/json.
  - 'Firecrawl API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`. The API key is obtained by signing
    up on the Firecrawl platform.'
  - The Firecrawl API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" when making requests to endpoints
    like /crawl.
