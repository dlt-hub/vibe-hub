auth_info:
- information_source; https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6:
  - Authentication is required for accessing private GPX files and for listing GPX
    traces owned by the authenticated user. Private GPX files (those not marked public)
    can only be downloaded by the owner account using authentication. The List endpoint
    requires authentication to retrieve GPX traces for the current authenticated user.
    The documentation does not specify the exact authentication method, headers, or
    parameters to use.
  - Authentication uses OAuth 2.0. Calls that update, create, or delete data require
    an authenticated and authorized user. Required OAuth scopes include read_prefs,
    write_prefs, write_api, read_gpx, write_gpx, write_notes, write_diary, write_redactions,
    write_blocks, consume_messages, and send_messages. HTTP 401 indicates login failure,
    and HTTP 403 indicates successful login but insufficient permissions or missing
    OAuth application scopes.
  - If the request is made as an authenticated user, the note is associated to that
    user account. If the OAuth access token used does not have the allow_write_notes
    permission, it is created as an anonymous note instead. Authentication is optional
    for creating notes. When authenticated, use an OAuth access token with the allow_write_notes
    permission scope; without this scope or without authentication, notes are created
    anonymously.
  - OAuth 2.0 is required for API authorization. The API client must obtain an OAuth
    2.0 token and include it in requests. Permissions are returned as scopes prefixed
    with "allow_" (e.g., "allow_read_prefs" for the "read_prefs" scope). An unauthorized
    client receives an empty permissions list. Check permissions via GET /api/0.6/permissions
    or GET /api/0.6/permissions.json.
  - Requests to modify the OSM database require OAuth authorization. Read requests
    do not require authorization except for user details endpoints. OAuth is the authorization
    mechanism used for write operations (create, update, delete).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6:
  - Query parameters limit (optional, default 100, max 10000) and bbox (optional,
    for geographic bounding box) control result size and scope. Response includes
    total attribute indicating total matching notes count. No explicit pagination
    mechanism (next/previous cursors or page numbers) is documented; results appear
    to be returned as a single response limited by the limit parameter.
  - The Get GPS Points endpoint uses a query parameter page=pageNumber to paginate
    through trackpoints within a bounding box. The documentation references this pagination
    mechanism but does not specify response fields indicating total pages, has_more
    status, or how to determine when pagination ends.
  - Use limit and offset query parameters to paginate results. limit controls the
    maximum number of changesets returned per request (default and typical maximum
    is 100), and offset specifies the starting position for the next request. Stop
    paginating when fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - Use the query parameter page to paginate through GPS track points. The page parameter
    specifies which group of 5,000 points to retrieve, starting with page 0 for the
    first 5,000 points. Increment page and resend the request with the same bounding
    box to retrieve additional points until fewer than 5,000 points are returned,
    indicating the final page.
