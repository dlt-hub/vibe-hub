auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.nxlog.co/integrations/db/elasticsearch-kibana.html:
  - API key authentication is required for the Elasticsearch REST API. Create an Elasticsearch
    API key and send it via the Authorization header using the ApiKey scheme format.
    Additionally, specify the path to the Elasticsearch CA certificate using the HTTPSCAFile
    directive for HTTPS connections.
  - Send logs to Elasticsearch using om_http output module with API key authentication.
    Include the Authorization header with the value "ApiKey <your_api_key>" where
    <your_api_key> is your Elasticsearch API key. The header name is "Authorization"
    and the format is "ApiKey" followed by your actual API key value.
  - The AddHeader directive is required for authenticating with the Elasticsearch
    REST API using an API key. The HTTPSCAFile directive specifies the path to the
    Elasticsearch CA certificate for HTTPS verification. Authentication credentials
    must be provided via the AddHeader directive when creating an Elasticsearch API
    key.
  - 'The Elasticsearch output module requires API key authentication sent via the
    Authorization header. Include the header "Authorization: ApiKey <your_api_key>"
    where <your_api_key> is your Elasticsearch API key. HTTPS certificate verification
    is configured separately via HTTPSCAFile.'
- information_source; https://docs.nxlog.co/integrations/siem/elastic-cloud.html:
  - 'Elasticsearch API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "ApiKey <your_api_key>". The connection uses HTTPS with a CA certificate
    for verification. Define ES_URL and API_KEY as constants, then use AddHeader Authorization:
    ApiKey %API_KEY% in the configuration.'
