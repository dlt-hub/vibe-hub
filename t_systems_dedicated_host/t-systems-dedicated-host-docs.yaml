notes:
- The API used to obtain a user token does not require authentication.
- 'Last updated: 2025-06-13 12:05 UTC'
- 'last updated: 2025-06-13 12:05 UTC'
- API requests sent by third-party applications to public cloud services must be authenticated
  using signatures.
- Obtain username, domain name, and project ID from the My Credential page.
- AK is a unique identifier that is associated with a secret access key; the access
  key ID and secret access key are used together to sign requests cryptographically.
- SK is a key that is used in conjunction with an access key ID to cryptographically
  sign requests. Signing a request identifies the sender and prevents the request
  from being altered.
- The cached token is valid for 15 minutes by default.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Last updated: 2025-07-16 09:20 UTC'
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- The token obtained from IAM is valid for only 24 hours.
- If you want to use a token for authentication, you can cache it to avoid frequently
  calling the IAM API.
- If the request is successful, a job ID is returned.
- If the request fails, an error code and error information are returned.
- A maximum of 10 tags can be added to a DeH.
- Tag key must be unique for a specific DeH and cannot be left blank.
- The validity period of a token is 24 hours. When using a token for authentication,
  cache it to prevent frequently calling the IAM API used to obtain a user token.
- The validity period of a token is 24 hours.
- Cache the token to prevent frequent API calling.
- Tag key cannot be left blank and must be unique for a specific DeH.
- Tag key contains a maximum of 36 characters and can include digits, letters, hyphens
  (-), and underscores (_).
- Tag value contains a maximum of 43 characters and can include digits, letters, hyphens
  (-), and underscores (_).
- This issue is the second official release.
- 'Modified the following content: Optimized the overview in Overview.'
- Change Number of Sockets to Number of CPUs (Sockets) in Overview and General-Purpose
  DeHs.
- For details about the APIs for creating ECSs on DeHs, see the Elastic Cloud Server
  API Reference.
- For a project-level service, you need to obtain a project-level token. When you
  call the API, set auth.scope in the request body to project.
- Using a token that will soon expire may cause API calling failures.
