  - API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with key ID and secret. Pass credentials via
    the `-u` flag in curl as `[YOUR_KEY_ID]:[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]`, or include them in
    the Authorization header as base64-encoded `key_id:key_secret`. Ensure you are
    using the correct keys for your environment (test vs live mode) and that your
    API key has not expired.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a Key ID and Key Secret. Credentials
    are passed in the Authorization header using the format -u [YOUR_KEY_ID]:[YOUR_KEY_SECRET],
    where YOUR_KEY_ID is the username and YOUR_KEY_SECRET is the password encoded
    in base64 for Basic auth.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://curlec.com/docs/api/orders/fetch-all/:
  - Use count (number of orders per page, optional) and skip (number of orders to
    skip, optional) query parameters to paginate. The response includes count field
    indicating returned items. Construct subsequent requests by incrementing skip
    by the previous count value.
- information_source; https://curlec.com/docs/api/understand/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters count and skip. count specifies the number of
    entities to fetch (default 10), and skip specifies the number of entities to skip
    (default 0). Use these parameters together to paginate results. Additionally,
    from and to are Unix timestamps to filter entities created within a specific time
    range.
