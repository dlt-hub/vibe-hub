    object containing size, totalElements, totalPages, and number fields to indicate
    current pagination state and when to stop (when number reaches totalPages minus
    one).'
  - Responses are paginated using a page object in the response containing size (page
    size), totalElements (total number of elements), totalPages (total number of pages),
    and number (current page index). Request parameters for pagination are not explicitly
    documented in the provided excerpt.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (zero-indexed,

    a links array with rel="self" containing the paginated URL, and a content array
    with the actual results.
  - Use query parameters page (default 0) and size (default 10) to paginate results.
    Response includes a links array with rel="self" containing the current page URL;

    array contains the paginated items.
