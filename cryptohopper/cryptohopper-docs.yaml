auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.cryptohopper.com/api-documentation/how-the-api-works:
  - Every request to the API requires OAuth2 authentication. Include your access token
    in the request header using the header parameter access-token with the value of
    your OAuth2 access token.
  - OAuth2 authentication is used. Obtain an access token through the OAuth2 authorization
    flow, then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for
    all API requests to https://api.cryptohopper.com/v1/ endpoints.
- information_source; https://www.cryptohopper.com/api-documentation/authentication:
  - 'Cryptohopper uses OAuth2 for API authorization. Applications must obtain grant
    tokens via the authorize endpoint, exchange them for access tokens, and include
    the access token in authorized HTTP requests to the API.


    To initiate OAuth2 authorization, send a GET request to https://www.cryptohopper.com/oauth2/authorize
    with parameters client_id (your app key) and response_type. After user grants
    access, the authorization server redirects to your redirect URL with code and
    state parameters in the GET query string. Exchange the code for an access token
    using your app key, app secret, user access token, and user access secret. Include
    the access token in subsequent API requests to act on behalf of the user.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow. First, redirect users to the authorization endpoint
    with client_id, response_type set to "code", redirect_uri, state, and optional
    comma-separated scope list. Exchange the returned code at https://www.cryptohopper.com/oauth2/token
    via POST with client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to "authorization_code",
    redirect_uri, and code to receive access_token and refresh_token in the response
    body for authenticating subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://www.cryptohopper.com/api-documentation/webhooks:
  - Webhook requests are authenticated using HMAC-SHA512 signature verification. The
    app_secret is used to generate an HMAC-SHA512 hash of the request body, which
    must match the X-HUB-SIGNATURE header value. Additionally, webhook validation
    requests require a verification_code to be echoed back in the response.
