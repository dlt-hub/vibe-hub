auth_info:
- information_source; https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/exchange/v1/rest-ws/index.html:
  - 'API Key and Secret Key are system-generated credentials used for authentication.
    The API Key can have permissions configured (default is "Read" only) and optionally
    restricted to whitelisted IP addresses. REST API requests require "Content-Type:
    application/json" header. Rate limits are applied per API method per API Key for
    authenticated calls.'
  - 'REST API private methods and WebSocket public/auth command require API key (as
    "api_key") and Digital Signature (as "sig"). Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 hash
    of request parameters: concatenate method + id + api_key + sorted_params_as_key_value_pairs
    + nonce, then hash with API Secret as the cryptographic key and encode as hex.
    For REST private endpoints, pass api_key and sig in the request. For WebSocket,
    invoke public/auth once per session with api_key and sig in the request body;
    subsequent user-specific commands do not require these credentials. Never include
    the API Secret in plain text.'
  - The API requires authentication via a nonce-based request signing mechanism. Each
    request must include a nonce field (Unix timestamp in milliseconds) and is designed
    for an authenticated user context, though the specific signing method, required
    headers, and credential format are not detailed in this excerpt.
  - 'To access user-specific websocket methods, the public/auth method requires two
    parameters: api_key (your API key as a string) and sig (a Digital Signature computed
    according to the Digital Signature section). These are sent in the JSON request
    body. REST API calls do not require this authentication step. The authentication
    is specific to websocket connections on the User API.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/exchange/v1/rest-ws/index.html:
  - Pagination uses zero-based page numbering with page and page_size parameters (both
    required) in the params object. The response structure is not shown, but page
    and page_size control which subset of fiat withdrawal transactions are returned
    per request.
  - Pagination uses zero-based page numbering with page and page_size parameters in
    the request params object. The response returns page and page_size fields indicating
    current pagination state; continue requesting with incremented page numbers until
    fewer items than page_size are returned or no more data exists.
