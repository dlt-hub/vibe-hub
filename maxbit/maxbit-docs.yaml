    include it in requests to authenticate with the exchange.
- information_source; https://api.maxbit.com/api-8039364:
  - Requests to this API require HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication. Include the
    parameters coin, network, and timestamp in the query string, compute an HMAC-SHA256
    signature of the query string using your secret key, and append the signature
    as the signature query parameter.
- information_source; https://api.maxbit.com/api-7902863:
  - 'Requests to this API require two authentication components: an API key passed
    in the X-MBX-APIKEY header, and a signature generated from the request timestamp.
    The signature must be included as a query parameter along with a UTC timestamp
    in milliseconds, and the Content-Type header must be set to application/json.'
  - 'The API requires API key authentication sent via the X-MBX-APIKEY header. Additionally,
    requests must include a timestamp parameter and a signature parameter (likely
    HMAC-based), though the exact signature generation method is not detailed in this
    excerpt. The API key should be provided in the header as X-MBX-APIKEY: {{maxbit-api-key}}.'
