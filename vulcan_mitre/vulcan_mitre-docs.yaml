  - 'API Token Authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Personal
    Access Tokens are generated from User Settings > API Tokens and must be included
    as "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" in all API requests along with Accept
    and Content-Type headers set to application/json.'
  - Session-based authentication uses cookies set by the web interface; API requests
    from the same browser automatically include the session cookie via the credentials
    option. For programmatic access outside the browser, use API token authentication
    by sending the token in the Authorization header as Bearer token or in the X-API-Key
    header.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. The token is passed in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer {api_token}', with the token value read from the VULCAN_API_TOKEN
    environment variable. Token management is available via POST /api/v1/user/tokens
    to create tokens (with name and scopes fields) and GET /api/v1/user/tokens to
    list existing tokens.
  - The API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Access tokens are passed in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN". Tokens should be stored in environment
    variables, never committed to version control, and rotated regularly. Always use
    HTTPS for token transmission.
  - The API uses token-based authentication where users create tokens via POST /api/v1/user/tokens
    with a name and scopes array (e.g., ["read", "write"]), and tokens can be revoked
    via DELETE /api/v1/user/tokens/:id. Tokens are created with specific scopes that
    define permissions for API access.
