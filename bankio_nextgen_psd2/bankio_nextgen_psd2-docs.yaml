auth_info:
- information_source; https://bankio.co.uk/open-banking/knowledge-base/OpenBankingUK/:
  - JWT-based authorization with signature verification using the "subject" claim,
    combined with Mutual TLS (MATLS) for transport-level security. Public keys are
    published via jwk_uri in JWK format for third parties to verify signed JWTs. Access
    tokens are validated by an API Gateway, either by invoking the authorization server
    (stateful tokens) or through local validation (stateless tokens). Transport certificates
    must be properly configured to access protected bank endpoints and APIs requiring
    specific permission levels.
- information_source; https://bankio.co.uk/open-banking/knowledge-base/openapi/:
  - Authorization header is required and must contain an authorization token. Additionally,
    X-Request-ID (UUID format), Digest (SHA-256), and Signature (with keyId) headers
    are required for request signing. TPP-Signature-Certificate header is also required
    containing the certificate as byte data.
  - 'OAuth2 Client Credentials flow is required for authentication (scope: pisp).
    Send the access token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Additionally,
    include required headers: X-Request-ID (UUID), TPP-PSU-ID, and PSU-IP-Address.
    Other headers like Digest, Signature, TPP-Signature-Certificate, and various TPP-*
    and PSU-* headers provide request signing, PSU identification, and redirect configuration
    but specifics on their exact format/requirements are not fully detailed in this
    excerpt.'
  - 'OAuth2 token endpoint supporting four grant types: Authorization Code, Client
    Credentials, Resource Owner Password Credentials, and Refresh Token. Confidential
    clients authenticate via HTTP Basic Authentication (base64 encoded client_id:client_secret
    in Authorization header) or by posting client_id and client_secret as formData
    parameters; public clients send client_id as formData. Required parameters vary
    by grant_type: Authorization Code requires code and redirect_uri; Client Credentials
    and password grant accept optional scope; Refresh Token requires refresh_token
    parameter. All grant types require client_id and client_secret except public clients
    which only need client_id.'
  - 'OAuth2 with Authorization Code flow is required (scope: pisp). Request must include
    X-Request-ID header (UUID), Digest header (SHA-256 hash), Signature header (keyId
    format), and TPP-Signature-Certificate header (byte). PSU identification headers
    (PSU-ID, PSU-ID-Type, PSU-Corporate-ID, PSU-Corporate-ID-Type, PSU-IP-Address,
    PSU-IP-Port, PSU-Device-ID, PSU-Geo-Location) and PSU context headers (PSU-Accept,
    PSU-Accept-Charset, PSU-Accept-Encoding, PSU-Accept-Language, PSU-User-Agent,
    PSU-Http-Method) are also required or conditional.'
