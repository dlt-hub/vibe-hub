auth_info:
- information_source; https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/reference/splunkbase/sbreleaseapiref:
  - Authentication occurs over SSL using HTTP Basic authentication. Credentials must
    be sent in the Authorization header using the format "Basic base64(username:password)".
    Only the user who uploaded the package can view its status.
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL with your Splunkbase (splunk.com)
    credentials. You must be logged in as the user who uploaded the release package.
    Provide credentials using the curl -u flag or equivalent Authorization header
    with base64-encoded username:password.
  - Basic authentication is required using username and password credentials passed
    via the -u flag in curl (or Authorization header with base64-encoded credentials).
    Authentication is mandatory; requests without credentials return HTTP 403. Failed
    authentication or lack of permission to upload to the specified app also returns
    HTTP 403.

  - 'Bearer token (JWT) authentication is required for all AppInspect endpoints. Obtain
    a JWT token from Splunk.com via the login endpoint at https://api.splunk.com/2.0/rest/login/splunk
    using basic auth (username and password), then include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>" for subsequent requests. A 401
    response with code "authorization_header_missing" is returned if the Authorization
    header is absent, or code "Unauthorized" if the token is invalid.'
  - 'Bearer token (JWT) authentication is required. Send the JWT token obtained from
    splunk.com in the Authorization header as a Bearer token (format: Authorization:
    Bearer <jwt_token>).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/reference/dsp-onprem/api/ingest/v1beta2:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    the maximum number of results to return, and the offset parameter specifies the
    starting position. Continue paginating by incrementing offset until fewer results
    than limit are returned or no results are returned.
- information_source; https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/reference/dsp-onprem/api/streams/v3beta1:
  - Pagination is implemented using offset and limit query parameters. The response
    includes an items array containing the paginated results and a total field indicating
    the total number of items available. Use limit to control page size and offset
    to navigate through pages.
  - Pagination uses offset (integer) and pageSize (integer) query parameters to control
    which results are returned in the response.
  - Pagination uses offset and pageSize query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (integer), and pageSize specifies the number of results per page (integer).
    Both are optional query parameters for the GET /connections endpoint.
  - Pagination uses query parameters offset (integer) and size (integer) to control
    which results are returned. The response structure is not shown, so the exact
    fields for navigating to the next page cannot be determined from this documentation.
