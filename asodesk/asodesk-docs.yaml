auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.asodesk.com/static/docs/html/modules/authentication.html:
  - Authentication uses a token-based scheme. Send a POST request to /api/obtain-token
    with username and password credentials to get a token, then include it in the
    Authorization header as "Token <string>" for all subsequent API requests.
  - This API uses token-based authentication. Obtain a token by POST to /api/obtain-token
    with username (email) and password in the JSON body, receiving a token string
    in response. Include this token in subsequent requests (typically in the Authorization
    header). Tokens expire after 24 hours and are invalidated if the account password
    changes; expired or invalid tokens return 401 Unauthorized with error code token_not_valid.
