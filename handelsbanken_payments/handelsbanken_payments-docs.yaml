auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.handelsbanken.com/api/psd2/guidelines/payments:
  - 'Authorization header using Bearer token scheme. The token is obtained from Step
    3 (ACG/DG access token) and is mandatory. Additionally, three mandatory headers
    are required: TPP-Request-ID (unique request identifier), TPP-Transaction-ID (unique
    transaction identifier), and X-IBM-Client-Id (registered application client ID).
    The Authorization header can alternatively accept a CCG token from Step 1.'
  - Authorization uses a Bearer token scheme. The CCG access token must be sent in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}". Additionally, the X-IBM-Client-Id
    header containing your registered application's client-id is mandatory. Both are
    required for all requests.
  - Client Credentials Grant (CCG) access token is required for payment initiation.
    The token is obtained via a POST request to https://api.handelsbanken.com/mlurd/oauth2/token/1.0
    using mutual TLS authentication with a private key file and certificate file,
    with the scope set to PIS (Payment Initiation Service). The resulting access token
    is then used in subsequent API calls for payment operations.
  - Handelsbanken uses OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant (CCG) flow with mutual TLS
    authentication. Send a POST request to https://api.handelsbanken.com/mlurd/oauth2/token/1.0
    with your private key file and public cert file, including grant_type=client_credentials,
    scope (e.g., PIS, AIS, CBPII separated by whitespace), and client_id as form-encoded
    parameters. The response contains an access_token valid for 15 minutes, which
    is then used to call the Payments API endpoints.
  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication is required along with bearer token authorization.
    Requests must include a private key file (--key) and public certificate file (--cert)
    for mTLS, an Authorization header with a bearer token obtained from a prior Payment
    Authorization Grant step, and an X-IBM-Client-Id header containing your application's
    client-id. Additional required headers include PSU-IP-Address, TPP-Request-ID,
    and TPP-Transaction-ID for transaction tracking and PSU identification.
