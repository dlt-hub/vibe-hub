auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/1.8.2/developer/rest.html:
  - Authentication to the REST API is performed via cookies established through the
    main web interface, or by using OAuth2 access tokens. To use an OAuth2 access
    token, send a GET request to /auth/login with the token URL parameter set to the
    access token, which will establish a session cookie that must be sent with every
    subsequent request.
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/2.3.0/developer/rest.html:
  - Authentication to the REST API uses cookies established via the main web interface
    login, or OAuth2 access tokens for automated access. To use an OAuth2 token, send
    a GET request to /auth/login with the token URL parameter set to the access token
    value; subsequent requests will use the cookie automatically established by the
    session.
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/2.7.0/developer/rest.html:
  - Authentication to the REST API is performed via session cookies established through
    the main web interface, or by using OAuth2 access tokens. To authenticate with
    an OAuth2 access token, send a GET request to /auth/login with the token URL parameter
    set to the access token value; subsequent requests must include the session cookie
    returned from authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/latest/developer/rest.html:
  - Authentication uses session cookies established via the main web interface login
    endpoint. First, POST credentials to https://<buildbot_url>/auth/login with basic
    auth (username and password), then include the returned session cookie with all
    subsequent API requests. OAuth2 authentication providers are not currently supported
    for API access.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/0.9.4/developer/rest.html:
  - Collection responses use `offset` and `limit` query parameters for pagination.
    `offset` is the 0-based index of the first result (default 0), and `limit` is
    the maximum number of results to return. Some resource types may impose a maximum
    limit; check resulting links to determine if further data is available.
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/1.8.2/developer/rest.html:
  - Pagination uses `offset` (0-based index of first result, optional) and `limit`
    (maximum number of results to return, optional, some resources impose maximums)
    query parameters. Check resulting links to determine if further data is available.
- information_source; https://docs.buildbot.net/2.3.0/developer/rest.html:
  - Collection responses use `offset` and `limit` query parameters for pagination.
    `offset` is the 0-based index of the first result after filtering and sorting,
    and `limit` is the maximum number of results to return. Check resulting links
    to determine if further data is available, as some resource types may impose a
    maximum limit.
