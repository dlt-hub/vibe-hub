auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.motorsportreg.com/:
  - Access Tokens sent to `/rest/tokens/access` endpoint with an X-Organization-Id
    header. Alternatively, use administrative username and password authentication.
    Each request must include an X-Organization-Id header containing the 35-character
    unique organization ID. Custom API credentials are deprecated.
  - 'All requests requiring authentication must use Basic Authentication. Include
    an Authorization header with the value Basic followed by a Base64-encoded string
    of username:password (e.g., Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==).
    Requests without valid credentials return 401 Unauthorized; requests with valid
    credentials but insufficient authorization return 403 Forbidden.'
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Credentials are provided using the `-u
    userid:password` flag in curl (or equivalent HTTP Basic Auth header `Authorization:
    Basic base64(userid:password)`). The same credentials apply to PUT, DELETE, and
    POST requests, including when tunneling PUT/DELETE through POST via the `_method`
    query parameter.'
  - OAuth 1.0a is the preferred authentication method. Register your application by
    contacting MotorsportReg, then obtain a Request Token from /rest/tokens/request,
    direct users to https://www.motorsportreg.com/index.cfm/event/oauth for authorization,
    and exchange it for an Access Token at /rest/tokens/access. Alternatively, use
    administrative username and password credentials. Some resources require an X-Organization-Id
    header.
  - OAuth token-based authentication is required for most endpoints. Pass the OAuth
    access token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme (per RFC 5849).
    Some endpoints like the token exchange require only request signing with no authentication.
    The X-Organization-Id header may be needed for organization-specific requests,
    which can be obtained from the GET /rest/me endpoint to identify user organizations.
