  - 'Bearer token authentication is required for SourceForge API requests. Send your
    SourceForge bearer token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer
    your_sourceforge_bearer_token" along with "Accept: application/json" and "Content-Type:
    application/json" headers. Required parameters for API calls include bsl_id (your
    business software listing ID), date_from, and date_to. Retrieve your bsl_id by
    making an authenticated request to the /activities endpoint; the response will
    contain your business software listings with associated IDs.'
  - Sourceforge API authentication uses a bearer token scheme. Obtain your bearer
    token by navigating to the sourceforge OAuth setup page at https://sourceforge.net/auth/oauth/,
    registering a new application, and generating a bearer token from the authorized
    applications section. Send this token in the Authorization header as a bearer
    token when making requests to the sourceforge API.
