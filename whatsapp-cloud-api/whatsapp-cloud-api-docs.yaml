notes:
- Do not uninstall the WhatsApp Business App after onboarding. This will disconnect
  the number from the platform.
- Coexistence is not compatible with APIs that are not officially supported.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Timings can be delayed during busy periods.
- Rapidbott is GDPR & HIPPA compliant
- The main reason why the widget may not show is if the domain is not whitelisted.
- Free trial available for 7 days.
- A good preparation is half the work, and defining your goals for your Rapidbott
  will make building one a whole lot easier.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Warning. It get's addictive
- Real-time monitoring of conversations from the dashboard
- Analytics available for tracking conversations and KPIs
- Excellent customer service is not just about answering questions, but also about
  understanding your customers’ needs.
- Conversational is the key here, as oftentimes the real solution someone is trying
  to find goes beyond just the first question they ask.
- Instagram doesn't support Preview feature
- If you already have a WeChat official account or wanted to register one, click 'Sign
  up'
- If you don't have an official account yet, click 'Sandbox Test account' to test
  the bot with your WeChat personal account
- You can choose English on the WeChat website by clicking the globe icon on the upper
  right side. However, some pages do not support translation.
- Google account must have access to the business (either owner or manager).
- For agency, you will need to be invited to be the manager of your client's business.
- If you get an error saying that fails to create an agent because the location is
  not verified, try to click cancel and refresh the page.
- Rate limits are in place for API requests.
- Ensure the correct OAuth scopes are set when creating the connected app.
- 'There are different types of fields: Text, Number, Boolean, Date, Datetime, JSON.'
- Make sure to manage your API key securely.
- Token limits apply based on the model used.
- System messages can be personalized.
- The use case is to control the history and monitor the execution time of requests
  to avoid server timeouts and token overconsumption.
- Enter the API key you fetched from your Claude account and click on Save.
- More Information to Process = Over consumption of tokens
- Ensure that the status indicates the key is ready to use before proceeding.
- Make sure you have 'Bot as API' enabled on your bot model inside Coze when publishing
  the bot
- Easy to manage
- Less maintenance
- Fewer mistakes
- More secure
- Use across flows, channels and even workspaces!
- Before integrating the app into your flow builder, you need to install the app even
  you are the creator of the app.
- You can also change a key by clicking the 'Settings' button next to the App later.
- Many options and information are present in the live chat.
- Use the Search bar to search a conversation by user name.
- Do make sure you have disabled live chat mode before sending the subflow.
- Users become contacts inside of your Rapidbott channel and information is gathered
  during conversations.
- Messages with type “Other” or without a content type will NOT be delivered to subscribers
  who interacted with you via Messenger more than 24 hours ago.
- Triggers can help you automate certain processes in the chatbot.
- make sure that your initial message contains only 1 text message with a button
- This is the only time the key will ever be displayed, so be sure not to lose it!
- Facebook and Instagram already have the users email, so it will display automatically
  so they just have to tap it.
- All add-ons are monthly payments and bot specific.
- Access to the WhatsApp Business API with Coexistence is only available to businesses
  actively using the WhatsApp Business App.
- Eligibility is determined by Meta based on account tenure and messaging quality
  history.
- only the phone number which requests the API key can test the bot
- you can send 'START' to get a new code, but make sure you update the key with your
  bot.
- 360Dialog doesn't allow sandbox users to access their media recourses. For example,
  if you use a question step to ask for a photo and store the URL in a text variable.
  You are unable to visit this URL to get the photo because you are using a sandbox.
- Business verification allows you to get increased sending limits.
- Without verification, you can send messages to up to 50 unique numbers per day.
- After verification, the limit increases to sending messages to 1000 unique numbers
  per day.
- The Business Verification process is unrelated to WhatsApp.
- An account can become restricted or disabled depending on the number and severity
  of issues.
- Restricted or disabled accounts can still appeal issues.
