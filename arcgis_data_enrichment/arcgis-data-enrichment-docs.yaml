notes:
- Custom Data Feeds allow you to access and use data from sources that are not natively
  supported with ArcGIS.
- It is highly recommended that your development and server machines run the same
  OS family.
- For cached maps, this resource represents a single cached tile for the map.
- The geoprocessing tasks may take a variable amount of time to complete.
- Test Image Service Description
- some fields may return null values
- Starting with the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1 release, a number of deep learning raster
  analysis services are introduced.
- To use Raster Analysis tasks, you also need Publisher privileges.
- The ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Server extension is deprecated with the release of ArcGIS
  Enterprise 11.4.
- OAuth2 with refresh token is required for authentication.
- The active portal account must be assigned a license with the ArcGIS Advanced Editing
  user type extension to use the Utility Network and Network Diagram services.
- If the query string exceeds 2,048 characters in length, submit the query as a POST
  request.
- For security reasons, all POST requests must include a token in the request body.
- The portal service can be accessed anonymously to perform some operations, such
  as searching for public content.
- To access restricted operations, you must include an access token with the request.
- To access a private item's data, you need to include an access token in the request
  along with the item ID.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires a Mapbox API key for access
- The portal service provides the functionality to create, manage, and access content,
  users, and groups in a portal.
- It also supports security operations to provide authenticated access to secure resources
  in the portal.
- Web applications created by the builders support security and can be shared with
  a group, shared publicly, or not shared.
- ArcGIS Experience Builder is a highly configurable app builder product that creates
  immersive web apps by combining maps, data, and interactive widgets with little
  to no coding.
- Easily create stories using interactive digital storytelling
- Stories are responsive and accessible across various devices
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- ArcGIS Enterprise supports organization, feature service, and geoprocessing webhooks.
- Use style names from the self endpoint for dynamic applications to ensure that you
  have the latest styles.
- To access the web map, implement authentication if the sharing level is set to private,
  group, or organization.
- Visualizations created with field values can be persisted in web maps/scenes and
  exported to JSON.
- Visualizations created with Arcade expressions can be persisted in web maps/scenes
  and exported to JSON.
- The default radius is 1,000 meters and the maximum value is 10,000 meters.
- Paging can be used to request up to 200 places.
- If your search returns more than 200 places, you can reduce the radius size or add
  categories and/or text.
- To get an access token for this operation, go to Get started.
- To get an access token, go to Security and Authentication > Get started.
- Service optimized for last-mile delivery scenarios.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
errors:
- '404 Not found: Tile not found'
- 'INVALID_REQUEST: Check the parameters in the request'
- 'JOB_FAILED: Review job results for more details'
- 'TIMEOUT: The request took too long to process'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'esriJobFailed: Job execution failed'
- 'esriJobTimedOut: Job execution timed out'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency.'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Check your API key'
- 'Invalid token: Ensure that the token has the required privileges.'
- 'Analysis failed: Check if the straight-line distance exceeds the allowed limits.'
