auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.feedpress.com/:
  - All API requests must include a key parameter with your API key. For user authentication,
    send the user to the /login.json endpoint with key and callback query parameters;
    upon successful authentication, the user receives a token parameter in the redirect
    to your callback URL, which you then use as a token parameter in subsequent API
    requests on behalf of that user.
  - 'Authorization is required using a Bearer token sent in the Authorization header.
    The token must be provided as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for requests to
    the hosting upload endpoint and likely other API operations.'
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests to private key endpoints.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all private feed endpoints. The
    feed name must be provided as a query parameter or in the request body depending
    on the endpoint.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests to the FeedPress API.'
