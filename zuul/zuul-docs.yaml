auth_info:
- information_source; https://cdn.maingear.com/project/zuul-ci.org/www/docs/zuul/13.0.0/_sources/client.rst.txt:
  - The Zuul Admin Client can generate JWT authentication tokens using the create-auth-token
    command. When an authenticator with a signing secret is configured in zuul.conf,
    tokens are created with user, tenant, and expiration parameters, and the token
    value is returned as a Bearer token for use in the Authorization header when querying
    protected REST API endpoints. The token includes an iat claim and optionally a
    zuul.admin claim with the tenant name.
- information_source; https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/4.0.0/discussion/tenant-scoped-rest-api.html:
  - JWT tokens are required for authentication. Tokens must be sent in the Authorization
    header using the Bearer scheme. The JWT must include authorization claims that
    specify tenant and project access permissions, and may include extra authentication
    claims for additional context.
  - Tenant-scoped REST API endpoints require a JWT bearer token passed in the Authorization
    header. The token should follow RFC 7519 standard and include a zuul.admin claim
    for authorization information, with short time-to-live (10 minutes or less) and
    minimal scope (ideally single tenant) to mitigate security risks.
- information_source; https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/4.0.0/reference/developer/specs/tenant-scoped-admin-web-API.html:
  - Authentication uses Bearer tokens sent via the Authorization header. On 401 responses,
    a WWW-Authenticate header is returned with realm "zuul.openstack.org" and error
    details including error and error_description fields indicating issues like expired
    tokens.
  - Bearer token authentication using JWT. Clients must include a valid JWT in requests
    to the REST API, typically in the Authorization header as a bearer token. Tokens
    should have a short time-to-live (30 minutes or less recommended). JWT validation
    is performed server-side, and tokens may include a zuul.admin claim to override
    predefined authorizations.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/6.1.0/rest-api.html:
  - 'Pagination uses two optional query parameters: limit (default 50, controls result
    count per request) and skip (controls number of results to skip, enabling offset-based
    pagination).'
  - 'The endpoint supports offset-based pagination using query parameters: limit (default
    50) to specify the number of results per request, and skip to specify how many
    results to skip. The response returns a list of buildsets; continue paginating
    by incrementing the skip value until fewer than limit results are returned.'
- information_source; https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/8.3.1/rest-api.html:
  - Pagination uses limit and skip query parameters. limit sets the maximum number
    of results returned (default 50), and skip specifies how many results to skip.
    Construct subsequent requests by incrementing skip by the number of results received
    until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - 'The /api/tenant/{tenant}/builds endpoint supports offset-based pagination using
    query parameters: limit (default 50) controls the number of results per request,
    and skip specifies how many results to skip before returning data.'
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters limit (default 50)
    to control page size and skip to specify the number of results to skip. There
    are no response fields indicating pagination state or how to construct subsequent
    requests.
