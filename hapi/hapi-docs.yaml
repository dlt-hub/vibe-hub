notes:
- Events must be registered before they can be emitted or subscribed to.
- 'Default value: allows parsing of the following mime types: application/json, application/*+json,
  application/octet-stream, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data,
  text/*'
- 'Default value: ''application/json''.'
- hapi provides a rich, laser-focused extensibility model that puts security and predictability
  first.
- 'Access: read / write.'
- 'Access: authentication strategy specific.'
- 'Access: read only.'
- 'Access: **podium** public interface.'
- State defaults can be modified via the server.options.state configuration option.
- Default content type is 'application/json'.
- Max bytes for incoming payload is 1048576 (1MB).
- Max parts allowed in multipart payloads is 1000.
- Payload reception timeout is set to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).
- Default HTTP status code when the payload is considered empty is 204.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- breaking changes
- BSD License
- Compatible with Node versions 16, 18, 20, 22
- If you think you have identified a security related issue with any hapi module or
  repository, please report it immediately to security@hapi.dev.
- All files need to end with a newline (or more accurately end of line). IDEs will
  often do a line separator instead. This is to ensure it is unix friendly.
- Statements should only be broken into multiple lines to improve readability.
- Every major version of the core module receives at least one year of support from
  the time of publication of the first x.0.0 release.
- Once a new major version is published, the previous major version goes into LTS
  maintenance mode.
- Identity is always an option for encoding, unless specifically excluded in the header
  using a weighting of zero.
- Basic authentication plugin.
- Basic authentication requires validating a username and password combination.
- bell does not maintain a session beyond a temporary state between the authorization
  flow
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Testing third-party authorization is often a painful process.
- isSecure must be set to false to remove the TLS requirement.
- Add support for providing clientSecret as a function
- Selective error catching and rewrite rules.
- Working with async/await introduces a new challenge in handling errors.
- Multiple concurrent requests are queued and processed once.
- Only node 12
- maxByteSize - sets an upper limit on the number of bytes that can be stored in the
  cache. Defaults to 104857600 (100MB).
- minCleanupIntervalMsec - the minimum number of milliseconds in between each cache
  cleanup. Defaults to 1000.
- cloneBuffersOnGet - by default, buffers stored in the cache are copied when they
  are set but not when they are retrieved. Defaults to false.
- maxSize sets an upper limit on the number of items that can be stored in the cache.
  Defaults to 1000.
- minCleanupIntervalMsec is the minimum number of milliseconds in between each cache
  cleanup. Defaults to 1000.
- Redis adapter for catbox
- The plugin also accepts other redis options not mentioned above.
- Uses cookie-based session management for authentication
- CSRF crumb generation and validation for hapi.
- Crumb is used to diminish CSRF attacks using a random unique token that is validated
  on the server side.
- It is highly discouraged to have a production servers `cors.origin` setting set
  to "[*]" or "true" with Crumb as it will leak the crumb token to potentially malicious
  sites.
- 'This ESLint plugin exposes two configurations: ''@hapi/recommended'' and ''@hapi/module''.'
- If you are developing a plugin, ensure your plugin dependencies are properly managed
  to guarantee that all dependencies are loaded before your plugin registration completes.
- h2o2 adds proxying functionality to a hapi server.
- The plugin can be registered with an optional object specifying defaults to be applied
  to the proxy handler object.
- The default variables of {protocol}, {host}, {port}, {path}, {query} take precedence.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- inert uses the custom 'file' variety to signal that the response is a static file
  generated by this plugin.
- Files are served with cache friendly `last-modified` and `etag` headers.
- Generated file listings and custom indexes.
- 'Pre-compressed file support for `content-encoding: gzip` responses.'
- File attachment support using `content-disposition` header.
- The wire protocol has not changed since 1.x.
- The greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in iron but in the
  policies and procedures surrounding its use.
- Designed to work seamlessly with the hapi web framework
- It is not advisable to put shared secrets in your source code, use environment variables
  and/or other encryption methods to encrypt/decrypt your shared secret.
- Support hapi v21, drop hapi v19, test ESM support
- lab is a simple test utility for Node.js.
- Add lab as a dev dependency to your project's package.json along with a test script
- This API is still a WIP. Feedbacks are welcome.
- Uses Basic authentication for routes
- Server and client examples provided
- Turn auth on by default
- Support for hapi v21, node v18, ESM tests, multiple registration
- subtext parses the request body and returns it in a promise.
- Uses Hapi with Vision for template rendering
- HTTP client utilities.
- Add logging to req/res details for debug mode
- The plugin requires a password for encryption that must be at least 32 characters
  long.
- yar is focused on session support, and does not require that a user be logged in
  to have a session.
- yar is capable of handling larger data sizes without any additional setup.
- catbox is a multi-strategy key-value object store.
- The default variables of `{protocol}`, `{host}`, `{port}`, `{path}`, `{query}` take
  precedence - it's best to treat those as reserved when naming your own `request.params`.
- Provides a set of utilities for returning HTTP errors.
- Uses Hapi framework for rendering views with Eta templates
