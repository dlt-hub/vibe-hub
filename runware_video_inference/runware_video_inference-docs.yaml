auth_info:
- information_source; https://runware.ai/docs/en/tools/remove-background:
  - The API key is passed as a query parameter named `apiKey` in the webhook URL (e.g.,
    `apiKey=sk_live_abc123`). Authentication uses this API key to authorize webhook
    requests.
- information_source; https://runware.ai/docs/en/tools/upscale:
  - The API accepts authentication via query parameters in webhook URLs. Authentication
    can be provided as either a token parameter named "token" (e.g., ?token=your_auth_token)
    or an API key parameter named "apiKey" (e.g., ?apiKey=sk_live_abc123). These credentials
    are passed directly in the URL query string when configuring webhook endpoints.
- information_source; https://runware.ai/docs/en/getting-started/how-to-connect:
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: Payload Auth, where an authentication
    task object with apiKey field is sent in the request body JSON array; or Header
    Auth, where the API key is sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
    Both methods use the same API key credential.'
  - To authenticate with the Runware API, include your API key either as the first
    element in the JSON request array (payload auth) or in the Authorization header
    using the format Bearer <API_KEY>. The API key is unique to your account and can
    be created from the API Keys page after signing up. All HTTP requests must use
    POST method with Content-Type header set to application/json.
- information_source; https://runware.ai/docs/en/image-inference/api-reference:
  - Webhooks can be secured using authentication tokens or API keys passed as query
    parameters in the webhook URL. For example, include `token=your_auth_token` or
    `apiKey=sk_live_abc123` as query string parameters in your webhook endpoint URL,
    or use custom parameters like `projectId` and `userId` for tracking. The authentication
    method depends on what your endpoint supports.
