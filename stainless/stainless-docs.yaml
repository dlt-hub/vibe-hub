auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/what-is-openapi-spec-a-guide-to-rest-api-documentation
  : - 'The documentation mentions that endpoints are secured using a `BearerAuth`
      scheme defined in `components/securitySchemes`. The top-level `security` key
      applies this scheme to the entire API, requiring an `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
      header for authentication.'
    - 'Your spec''s security definitions can generate a remote MCP server that implements
      standard OAuth flows. The example OpenAPI spec for an invoicing API uses BearerAuth
      as the security scheme defined at the global level under the security key, meaning
      all endpoints require bearer token authentication. The token should be sent
      in the Authorization header as a Bearer token (format: Authorization: Bearer
      <token>).'
- ? information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/how-authentication-works-in-rest-api-methods-and-workflows
  : - Bearer token authentication using an API key. The API key is passed in the Authorization
      header as "Bearer ${API_KEY}" and is read from the process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY
      environment variable. Alternatively, SDKs can read the API key from process.env.MY_API_KEY
      by default or accept it explicitly via the apiKey parameter during client initialization.
    - 'This documentation describes three authentication methods: Bearer tokens (JWTs)
      sent in the Authorization header, OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework for
      third-party access, and Basic Authentication using Base64-encoded credentials
      in the Authorization header. For Bearer tokens, include the token as "Authorization:
      Bearer <token>". For Basic Authentication, send "Authorization: Basic <Base64-encoded
      username:password>". OAuth 2.0 involves an Authorization Server issuing access
      tokens through flows like Authorization Code with PKCE, which the client then
      uses in subsequent requests.'
- information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/how-do-rest-apis-work-the-developer-guide-explained:
  - Servers need to know who is making a request. Common authentication schemes include
    sending an API key or a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Modern SDKs
    simplify this by letting you set the key once during client initialization, often
    reading it securely from an environment variable.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/how-to-implement-rest-api-pagination-offset-cursor-keyset
  : - Pagination uses `limit` and `offset` as query parameters. The `limit` parameter
      controls page size with a reasonable default and maximum, while `offset` specifies
      the starting position (e.g., `offset=40` with `limit=20` fetches items 41-60).
      The response includes `total` for total item count, `next_url` and `prev_url`
      for navigation links constructed with updated limit and offset values.
- ? information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/what-is-openapi-spec-a-guide-to-rest-api-documentation
  : - The /invoices GET endpoint uses query parameters limit (integer, default 20)
      and starting_after (string) for pagination. The response returns a paginated
      list of invoices, with starting_after used as a cursor to fetch subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/how-do-rest-apis-work-the-developer-guide-explained:
  - Pagination uses query parameters like limit and offset or a cursor to fetch data
    in chunks with GET requests.
- information_source; https://www.stainless.com/sdk-api-best-practices/openapi-path-vs-query-vs-header-parameters-examples:
  - Pagination uses standard query parameters like `limit` and `after_cursor` defined
    in the OpenAPI spec. SDKs provide auto-pagination helpers that automatically fetch
    subsequent pages, allowing iteration through datasets without manual cursor management.
