auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.exchange.cryptomkt.com/v2:
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with public and secret keys. Send credentials
    as `-u "publicKey:secretKey"` in the Authorization header. Additionally, certain
    endpoints require specific API key Access Rights, such as "Payment information"
    for the crypto withdrawal estimate endpoints.
  - API key and secret key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Include credentials
    as "publicKey:secretKey" in the Authorization header (base64-encoded) or use the
    -u flag in curl requests. The API key must have appropriate permissions for the
    requested operation.
  - API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Send credentials as `-u "publicKey:secretKey"`
    in the request header, where publicKey is the username and secretKey is the password.
    This applies to endpoints like POST /api/2/sub-acc/freeze. No specific API key
    Access Rights are required for these subaccount operations.
  - API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Send credentials as `publicKey:secretKey`
    in the Authorization header (base64-encoded). The endpoint requires an API key
    with "Withdraw cryptocurrencies" access right for the crypto withdraw operation,
    and "Payment information" access right for the transfer-convert operation.
  - API key authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Send credentials as a base64-encoded
    "publicKey:secretKey" pair in the Authorization header using the format "Basic
    base64(publicKey:secretKey)". Certain endpoints require specific API key Access
    Rights such as "Withdraw cryptocurrencies" or "Payment information".
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.exchange.cryptomkt.com/v2:
  - Pagination uses `limit` (query parameter, optional, default 100, max 1000) and
    `offset` (query parameter, optional, default 0, max 100000) to control page size
    and starting position. Response is a flat array of candles with no explicit pagination
    fields; construct next request by incrementing offset by limit value.
  - Pagination uses an index-based approach where the from query parameter specifies
    a 64-bit integer threshold, limit controls results per request (default 100),
    sort determines order (ASC or DESC), and by specifies the sort field (index).
    Stop paginating when the response contains fewer results than the limit or when
    no new transactions exist beyond the current index.
  - Pagination uses limit and from parameters in query string. limit parameter controls
    page size (example shows limit=100 and limit=10). from parameter specifies the
    starting trade ID for the next request, constructed by adding 1 to the last trade's
    id from the previous response. Stop paginating when the response contains fewer
    trades than the limit or is empty.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset parameters. limit is optional with a default
    of 100 and maximum of 1000, while offset is optional with a default of 0 and maximum
    of 100000. When clientOrderId is provided, other parameters including limit and
    offset are ignored.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. The limit parameter controls page
    size with a default of 100 and maximum of 1000, while offset parameter specifies
    the starting position with a default of 0 and maximum of 100000.
