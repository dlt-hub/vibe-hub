- information_source; https://coefficient.io/databricks-api/setup-databricks-api-integration:
  - 'Databricks APIs use Bearer Token authentication with a Personal Access Token
    or service principal credentials. Send the token in the Authorization header as
    "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN", set the base URL to https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/,
    and include Content-Type: application/json header for POST requests. Store credentials
    securely in environment variables.'
  - Databricks uses Personal Access Tokens (PATs), OAuth, or service principal authentication.
    PATs are sent as bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Service principals
    require workspace permissions and specific setup. OAuth involves multiple authentication
    flows with token scope requirements. Credentials must match endpoint scopes or
    requests fail with 401 errors. Token expiration and rotation require secure credential
    management. Service principal setup demands specific workspace permissions that
    may not be clearly documented.
- information_source; https://coefficient.io/netsuite-api/netsuite-webhooks:
  - Token-Based Authentication (TBA) is required for secure API access to webhook
    endpoints. Create integration records with proper tokens, configure OAuth for
    external systems if needed, and implement HMAC-SHA256 signature validation using
    a shared secret to verify incoming webhook authenticity. Use HTTPS endpoints exclusively
    and include proper error handling and logging for security monitoring.
- information_source; https://coefficient.io/quickbooks-api/quickbooks-webhooks:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required for QuickBooks API access. Configure your
    app in the Intuit Developer portal with a redirect URI that matches your application's
    callback URL exactly. The redirect URI handles the authorization code exchange
    for access tokens. Additionally, implement HMAC-SHA256 signature validation using
    the verifier token provided by QuickBooks to authenticate webhook payloads in
    POST requests to your HTTPS endpoint.
  - QuickBooks webhooks require OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure app-to-QuickBooks
    communication. All webhook notifications must be verified using HMAC-SHA256 signature
    validation with a verifier token provided by Intuit, and webhook endpoints must
    use HTTPS with publicly accessible URLs to receive POST notifications.
