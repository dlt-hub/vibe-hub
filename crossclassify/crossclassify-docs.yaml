  - Take the x-api-key and auth token from project settings in app.crossclassify.com.
    Send x-api-key as a header in API requests.
  - 'The CrossClassify API requires two credentials for authentication: an x-api-key
    and an auth token, both obtainable from the project settings at app.crossclassify.com.
    These credentials must be included in requests, likely as headers, to access fraud
    detection services.'
  - Use the API key and authentication token obtained from your CrossClassify project
    settings. Include the API key in the request header as `X-API-Key`. The authentication
    token should also be configured in your HTTP client headers alongside the API
    key for accessing the endpoints.
