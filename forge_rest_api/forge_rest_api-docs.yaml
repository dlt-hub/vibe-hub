auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.getforge.com/guides/rest-api-v1/:
  - Authentication requires first logging in via POST to https://api.getforge.com/cli/login
    with email and password in the JSON body, which returns a token. This token should
    then be stored and used for subsequent API requests to authenticate the user account.
  - 'Forge API uses token-based authentication. Users log in via POST to /cli/login
    with email and password to receive a token, then include that token as a query
    parameter in subsequent requests. For deployments, a site_token is passed as a
    form field.


    Specifically: POST /cli/login accepts JSON body with email and password fields.
    The response returns a token. Use this token by appending ?token=YOUR_TOKEN to
    query strings in GET requests like /cli/sites. For deployment operations, pass
    site_token as a form field in multipart POST requests to /v2/cli/deploy.'
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication acquired through a login endpoint. Obtain
    a token by POSTing email and password to `https://api.getforge.com/cli/login`,
    then include the token as a query parameter named `token` in subsequent requests
    (e.g., `?token=YOUR_TOKEN`). All requests require `Content-Type: application/json`
    and `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers. For deployments, use the `site_token` parameter.
    Tokens should be stored securely and reused across requests.'
- information_source; https://docs.getforge.com/guides/rest-api-v2/:
  - Site tokens are used for API authentication and can be passed either as a query
    parameter named site_token or in the request body. Account tokens are passed as
    query parameters named account_token. Both token types provide scoped access to
    specific resources (sites or account information).
  - The API uses site token-based authentication. The site_token credential must be
    provided either as a query parameter named site_token or as a field in the JSON
    request body named site_token depending on the endpoint (GET requests use query
    parameters, POST requests use JSON body fields).
