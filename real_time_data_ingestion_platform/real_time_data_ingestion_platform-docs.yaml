  - 'RTDIP REST APIs require Azure Active Directory authentication. Obtain an Azure
    AD token and pass it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token using the format
    Authorization: Bearer <<token>>. Azure Identity packages are available for Python,
    .NET, Java, and Javascript to obtain tokens for both end users and service principals.'

  - Azure AD OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Obtain an access token using DefaultAzureCredential
    with scope "2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d/.default", then pass it in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Pass the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}". The access_token value must be obtained separately
    and formatted as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
  - The API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. For Service Principal authentication,
    obtain an access token by making a POST request to the Microsoft token endpoint
    (https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant id}/oauth2/v2.0/token) with grant_type
    "client_credentials", providing client_id, client_secret, and scope "2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d/.default"
    in the request body. Then include the returned access_token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access_token}" for API calls.
