notes:
- All measurements for snowfall and weather are provided in metric units.
- Most ski resorts offer daily updates, but there may be times when a resort doesn't
  update promptly.
- At least one of regionId or resortIds is required.
- Snow reports are sourced directly from the ski resorts and are only recorded during
  the ski season.
- Always filter based on updatedDt as the resort snow report can be outdated.
