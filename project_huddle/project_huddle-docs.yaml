auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.projecthuddle.com:
  - Access tokens are passed as query parameters in URLs. The example shows an access_token
    query parameter with a token value (e.g., access_token=87e63af5cb8f4262a8f44e8842341b99)
    appended to resource links for authentication.
  - Access tokens are passed as query parameters in resource links, using the parameter
    name access_token with a token value like ce635f81fd0b4c77decf759a9919deec. The
    token appears to be included directly in the URL to authorize access to protected
    resources.
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the Authorization header with
    the value 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' in all requests to this endpoint.
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with each request to authenticate
    API calls.'
  - Authentication uses a Bearer token scheme. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" in all requests to this endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.projecthuddle.com:
  - Pagination is controlled by the offset query parameter (optional, integer type)
    which offsets the result set. However, no response fields or headers indicating
    pagination state (such as next, has_more, total_count, or Link headers) are described,
    so the complete pagination mechanism cannot be determined from this documentation.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (current page), per_page (maximum
    items per page), and offset (result set offset). All three are optional integers
    with no specified defaults or limits documented.'
  - Pagination uses page (current page number) and per_page (maximum items per page)
    as optional query parameters. Response includes pagination metadata in the _links
    section with next/prev URLs for navigation.
  - Use query parameters page (current page, optional integer) and per_page (maximum
    items per page, optional integer) to paginate through results. The response includes
    links for navigation via the _links object.
  - page (query, optional, integer) controls the current page of results; per_page
    (query, optional, integer) controls the maximum number of items per page. Stop
    paginating when the response contains fewer items than per_page or when page exceeds
    available pages.
