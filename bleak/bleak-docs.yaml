notes:
- Do not name your script `bleak.py`! It will cause a circular import error.
- Make sure you always get to call the disconnect method for a client before discarding
  it;
- Bleak requires the same asyncio run loop to be used for all of its operations.
- Your program will not work correctly if you call it more than once.
- If you are using the built in WiFi/Bluetooth module on a Raspberry Pi and are seeing
  occasional “Not connected” errors, it may be due to wifi interference on the chip
  level.
- When changing the structure of services/characteristics on a device, remove the
  device from BlueZ to read everything again.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- New Scanner object to allow for async device scanning.
- Updated `txdbus` requirement to version 1.1.1
- Implemented `write_gatt_descriptor` for Bluez backend.
- Large change in Bluez backend handling of Twisted reactors.
- Improved scanning data for macOS backend.
- Improved error handling for .NET backend.
- This is the preferred method to install bleak, as it will always install the most
  recent stable release.
- The develop branch can also be installed using pip.
- Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices acting as
  GATT servers.
- The scanner will listen for BLE advertisements, optionally filtering on advertised
  services or other conditions.
- On some devices, some characteristics may require authentication in order to read
  or write the characteristic.
- This method is not available on macOS. Instead of manually initiating pairing, the
  user will be prompted to pair the device the first time that a characteristic that
  requires authentication is read or written.
- Unpairing will also disconnect the device.
- Connecting to the host DBus from within a user namespace will fail.
- Hardcode a UID with the BLEAK_DBUS_AUTH_UID environment variable.
- There is no pairing functionality implemented in macOS right now.
- Timeouts should be set accordingly for GATT read or write operations.
- There is no pairing functionality implemented in Pythonista iOS app right now, since
  it does not seem to be any explicit pairing methods in Pythonista _cb (CoreBluetooth
  wrapper).
- Pythonista _cb (CoreBluetooth wrapper) does not differentiate between data from
  a notification and data from a read.
- There is no pairing functionality implemented in macOS right now, since it does
  not seem to be any explicit pairing methods in CoreBluetooth.
- If the user doesn’t allow it, a BleakBluetoothNotAvailableError will raised every
  time Bluetooth is accessed.
- The python-for-android backend has not been fully tested.
- Bluetooth needs permissions for access.
- No pairing functionality implemented in Pythonista iOS app right now.
- There is no functionality to get characteristic descriptors implemented in Pythonista
  iOS app right now.
errors:
- 'ImportError: cannot import name ''BleakClient'' from partially initialized module
  ''bleak'' (most likely due to a circular import)'

  permission.'

  iOS.
