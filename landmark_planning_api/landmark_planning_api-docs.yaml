auth_info:

  - 'Authentication requires two components sent in request headers: an API key via
    the x-api-key header and a bearer token via the Authorization header. The bearer
    token is obtained from an initial authentication call that returns a token in
    the response header, which must then be included as Authorization: Bearer {token}
    in all subsequent API calls. Tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity or upon
    subscription lapse and must be regenerated if invalid. Required headers for all
    API calls after authentication are: Authorization: Bearer {authentication token}
    and x-api-key: {api-key}.'
  - 'The API uses Basic authentication with an additional API key header. To authenticate,
    first call the login endpoint with credentials encoded as Authorization: Basic
    {base64(username:sha256_hash(password))} and x-api-key: {api-key} headers. The
    login endpoint returns a token that must be included in all subsequent API calls.'
