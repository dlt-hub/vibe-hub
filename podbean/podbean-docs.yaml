auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.podbean.com/podbean-api-docs/:
  - Access tokens are required and must be passed as a query parameter named access_token.
    The token is validated server-side, and an invalid token will result in an error
    response. Include the access_token parameter in the request URL when calling the
    Read Episode endpoint.
  - Access tokens are required and passed as query parameters named access_token.
    The documentation shows an example using curl with access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    as a query parameter, and error responses reference invalid_token errors, indicating
    token-based authentication is the primary auth mechanism.
  - Access tokens are required and passed as query parameters. Include access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    in the request URL query string. The User-Agent header should also be included
    in requests.
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, I can identify authentication information:


    The API requires an access_token parameter to be submitted with requests. This
    token should be included as a parameter when making API calls to endpoints like
    the file upload authorization endpoint at https://api.podbean.com/v1/files/uploadAuthorize.
    The access_token is a String type parameter that must be provided for authentication
    purposes.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. To exchange an authorization code for
    an access token, make a POST request to https://api.podbean.com/v1/oauth/token
    with HTTP Basic authentication using YOUR_CLIENT_ID as username and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    as password. Include grant_type=authorization_code, code=CODE, and redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
    in the request body.
