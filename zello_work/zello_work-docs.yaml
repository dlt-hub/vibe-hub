auth_info:
- information_source; https://zellowork.com/api.htm:
  - 'API authentication requires three steps: first obtain a security token using
    user/gettoken with API_KEY (defined in common_params.cfg.php as an alpha-numeric
    sequence), username, and password; then call user/login with the token to authenticate
    and receive a Session ID; use the Session ID for all subsequent API calls, and
    call user/logout to end the session.'
  - Authentication is required via a session ID parameter. The sid (Session ID) must
    be obtained from a gettoken call and then passed as a GET query parameter named
    sid in subsequent requests. For example, requests should include ?sid={sid} where
    sid is the session ID value received from the gettoken endpoint.
  - Authentication is required via a session ID. The sid (Session ID) parameter must
    be passed as a GET query parameter in requests. This session ID is obtained from
    a prior gettoken call. The sid parameter is required for all documented endpoints
    (channel/delete, channel/roleslist, and others).
  - 'Authentication uses a session-based approach where the client must first call
    gettoken to receive a session ID (sid) and token, then include the sid as a query
    parameter in subsequent requests. The initial authentication requires an MD5 hash
    computed as md5(md5(user_password) + token + api_key).


    Key details: Session ID is passed as the sid query parameter in GET requests.
    The token is obtained from the gettoken endpoint response. The API key and user
    password are used only during initial token acquisition to compute the authentication
    hash.'
  - Authentication uses session-based tokens. A Session ID (sid) must be obtained
    from a gettoken call and then passed as a GET query parameter (sid={sid}) in subsequent
    API requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://zellowork.com/api.htm:
  - The endpoint uses offset-based pagination with start (0-based starting index,
    optional, defaults to 0) and max (optional maximum results per request, defaults
    to system page size usually 100) as query parameters. The response includes total
    (total number of users) and returned (number of users in current response) fields
    to indicate pagination state.
  - Use query parameters max (optional, maximum number of results) and start (optional,
    index of first result) to paginate through channels. The response returns a channels
    array; construct subsequent requests by incrementing start by max until fewer
    results than max are returned.
