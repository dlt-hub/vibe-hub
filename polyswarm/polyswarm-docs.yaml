pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers/polyswarm-rest-api-v3:
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation. Include the `offset` value returned by
    the server in the `limit` and `offset` query parameters for subsequent requests;
    the server provides the next encrypted offset token that must be used unmodified.
    For Hash Search endpoints, use the `has_more` response flag to determine when
    to stop paginating, particularly for weaker hash algorithms like md5 or sha1 where
    collisions are more probable.
  - Use limit parameter for initial request. Subsequent requests use offset value
    returned in previous response. has_more flag indicates if more pages available;
    stop when has_more=false. Each page consumes one quota unit.
