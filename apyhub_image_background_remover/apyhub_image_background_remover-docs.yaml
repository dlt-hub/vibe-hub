  - 'All API requests require authentication using one of two mechanisms: token-based
    authentication via the `apy-token` header, or basic authentication via the `Authorization`
    header. Tokens are generated from workspace settings under "API Keys" and must
    be passed as the `apy-token` request header; alternatively, basic authentication
    credentials can be sent using the standard `Authorization` header.'
  - 'The API requires bearer token authentication passed as the `apy-token` header
    in each request. Include the token value in the header like `apy-token: {{token}}`
    where {{token}} is your actual API token obtained from ApyHub.'
