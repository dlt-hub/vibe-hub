auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gravatar.com/rest-api/:
  - 'Retrieve a user''s profile by an identifier such as the SHA256 hash of an email
    address or a profile URL slug. Authentication is optional via Bearer token in
    the Authorization header, but full profile information is only available in authenticated
    requests. Send the Bearer token as Authorization: Bearer $GRAVATAR_API_KEY in
    the request headers.'
  - Some endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens in the Authorization
    header. API keys are obtained from the Gravatar Developer Dashboard and provide
    higher rate limits (1000 vs 100 requests per hour) plus access to additional endpoints.
    Include the API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of requests.
- information_source; https://docs.gravatar.com/pricing:
  - Authenticated requests to the Gravatar API are made using an API key, which must
    be provided to access richer data and receive higher default rate limits compared
    to unauthenticated requests. The documentation does not specify the exact header
    name, parameter name, or method for sending the API key.
- information_source; https://docs.gravatar.com/guides/llms-txt/:
  - 'API Key authentication is required for production use. Send the API key in the
    X-Gravatar-API-Key header with each request. Default rate limit is 1000 requests
    per hour for authenticated requests; higher limits are available upon request
    to the Gravatar team. Rate limit information is returned in response headers:
    X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset.'
  - Gravatar API uses Bearer Token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'. API keys are created through the Gravatar Developer
    Dashboard and should be stored in environment variables, never exposed in client-side
    code.
