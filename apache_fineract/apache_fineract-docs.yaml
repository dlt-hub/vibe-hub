auth_info:
- information_source; https://demo.mifos.io/api-docs/apiLive.htm:
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded credentials passed as
    a query parameter. Send a POST request to `self/authentication?username={username}&password={password}`
    to obtain a `base64EncodedAuthenticationKey`. For subsequent requests, include
    the access token via the `access_token` query parameter in the URL (e.g., `POST
    self/userdetails?access_token={base64EncodedAuthenticationKey}`). The response
    includes user details, roles, permissions, and an `authenticated` boolean flag.
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded credentials passed as
    query parameters in the POST request to the authentication endpoint. The response
    includes a base64EncodedAuthenticationKey that can be used for subsequent requests,
    along with user details, roles, permissions, and optional staff information if
    the user is linked to a staff member. OAuth2 is also supported as an alternative
    authentication capability for fetching current user details.
  - Credentials are passed as query parameters in a POST request to the authentication
    endpoint. The endpoint accepts username and password as query parameters (e.g.,
    username=mifos&password=password) and returns a base64EncodedAuthenticationKey
    in the response that should be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used to verify credentials. Send a POST request to
    the authentication endpoint with username and password as query parameters. The
    response includes a base64EncodedAuthenticationKey that should be used in subsequent
    API requests. Use this key in the Authorization header as HTTP Basic Auth (base64-encoded
    credentials).
  - OAuth2 password grant flow is used for authentication. POST to api/oauth/token
    with query parameters username, password, client_id (community-app), client_secret
    (123), and grant_type (password). The response includes an accessToken field that
    should be used in subsequent authenticated requests. Authenticated responses include
    userId, roles with permissions, and office/staff information.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://demo.mifos.io/api-docs/apiLive.htm:
  - Pagination for job run history uses offset and limit query parameters. The response
    includes totalFilteredRecords and pageItems array. Use offset to specify the starting
    position and limit to specify the number of records per page.
  - Pagination uses mandatory query parameters limit and offset. The response includes
    totalFilteredRecords indicating total filtered records and pageItems array containing
    the paginated results. To paginate, increment offset by the limit value in subsequent
    requests.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the starting position (example offset=10), and limit specifies the number of results
    per page (example limit=50). The response includes totalFilteredRecords indicating
    total matching records and pageItems containing the paginated results array.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes totalFilteredRecords
    indicating total matching records and pageItems containing the paginated results.
    Use offset to specify the starting position and limit to specify the number of
    records per page.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset (integer, optional,
    defaults to 0) indicates the result from which pagination starts, and limit (integer,
    optional, defaults to 200) restricts the size of results returned.
