notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Highlight is now part of LaunchDarkly
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- By default, Highlight will obfuscate all inputs and any text that matches commonly
  used Regex expressions of personally identifiable information. This offers a base
  level protection from recording info such as addresses, phone numbers, social security
  numbers, and more. It will not obfuscate any images or media content.
- This mode is only available in SDK versions 8.0.0 and later.
- Highlight is now part of LaunchDarkly.
