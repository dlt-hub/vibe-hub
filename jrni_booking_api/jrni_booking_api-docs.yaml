- information_source; https://api-docs.jrni.com/v3/authentication:
  - 'All API requests require the App-Id header. The Auth-Token header is required
    for endpoints with Member, Contact, or Admin permission levels. Auth tokens are
    obtained by posting email and password to /api/v3/login/admin or /api/v3/login/member
    endpoints, or returned in basket responses. Send both headers as: App-Id: [your
    app id] and Auth-Token: [token value].'
  - 'Authentication uses a login endpoint that accepts email and password in the request
    body and returns an auth token. The token must be sent in subsequent requests
    via the Auth-Token header along with the App-Id header. Tokens are valid for 24
    hours from last use and expire with a 401 response. For purchase APIs, either
    a long ID parameter or an Auth-Token header (for authenticated members) is required.


    Key details: POST to /login/member with JSON body containing email and password
    fields. Required headers: App-Id (application ID) and Auth-Token (returned from
    login, used in subsequent requests). Token validity: 24 hours from last use. Purchase
    APIs use either a unique long ID or Auth-Token for authenticated members.'
  - The JRNI API uses two required headers for authentication. The App-Id header identifies
    the client and is required on all API requests. The Auth-Token header is used
    for authenticating user sessions (documentation appears incomplete but indicates
    token-based authentication). Both headers must be included in HTTP requests to
    the API.
- information_source; https://api-docs.jrni.com/v5/authentication:
  - Authentication uses two main approaches depending on the API context. For member
    APIs, obtain an auth token by posting email and password to the login endpoint,
    then include the token in subsequent requests. All requests require the App-Id
    header set to your application ID. Include the Auth-Token header with the token
    value returned from login. Tokens are valid for 24 hours from last use and expire
    to a 401 error. Purchase APIs can alternatively use a long ID parameter for guest
    authentication, or an auth token if the purchase was made by an authenticated
    member.
  - 'The API uses two required headers for authentication. The App-Id header identifies
    the client on all requests. The Auth-Token header provides authorization and is
    obtained differently depending on permission level: for basket operations it is
    returned in the response from the add item endpoint, for admin access it is obtained
    by calling the login endpoint with email and password credentials. Auth tokens
    for public booking journeys are typically valid for 15 minutes but configurable.
    Permission types include Public (no auth required), Member (authenticated account),
    Contact (non-authenticated account), and Admin (studio interface administrators).'
