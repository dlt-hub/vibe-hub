In this guide, we'll set up a complete Brex data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector, like in the partial example code below:

```python-outcome
@dlt.source
def brex_migration_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://platform.brexapis.com/v2/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            users,,cards,,trips
            ],
    }
    [...]
    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    # Connect to destination
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='brex_migration_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='brex_migration_data', 
    )
    # Load the data
    load_info = pipeline.run(brex_migration_source())
    print(load_info) 
```

### Why use dltHub Workspace with LLM Context to generate Python pipelines?

- Accelerate pipeline development with AI-native context
- Debug pipelines, validate schemas and data with the integrated **Pipeline Dashboard**
- Build Python notebooks for end users of your data
- **Low maintenance** thanks to Schema evolution with type inference, resilience and self documenting REST API connectors. A shallow learning curve makes the pipeline easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses, bringing mature data loading to pythonic Iceberg with or without catalogs

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from brex_migration‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Users: Manage and retrieve user information.
- Cards: Handle card-related operations.
- Trips: Access trip data and details.
- Titles: Manage titles associated with users or departments.
- Company: Retrieve and manage company-related information.
- Budgets: Manage budgeting data and operations.
- Vendors: Handle vendor information and operations.
- Expenses: Manage expense entries and details.
- Webhooks: Set up webhook notifications for various events.
- Locations: Access location data related to the company.
- Departments: Manage department information.

You will then debug the Brex pipeline using our Pipeline Dashboard tool to ensure it is copying the data correctly, before building a Notebook to explore your data and build reports.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - We suggest using a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started!

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Set up `dlt` Workspace**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt[workspace]
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Brex support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:brex_migration duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup the necessary files and folders for the next step.
    
2. ü§† **Start LLM-assisted coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a prompt to get you started:
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Brex API, as specified in @brex_migration-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints users and  and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in brex_migration_pipeline.py and name the pipeline brex_migration_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python brex_migration_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Set up credentials** 
    
    The Brex API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, requiring an access token that can be obtained via client credentials grant.
    
    To get the appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.brex.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python brex_migration_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly, you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline brex_migration load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset brex_migration_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/brex_migration.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **Debug your pipeline and data with the Pipeline Dashboard**

    Now that you have a running pipeline, you need to make sure it‚Äôs correct, so you do not introduce silent failures like misconfigured pagination or incremental loading errors. By launching the dlt Workspace Pipeline Dashboard, you can see various information about the pipeline to enable you to test it. Here you can see:
    - Pipeline overview: State, load metrics
    - Data‚Äôs schema: tables, columns, types, hints
    - You can query the data itself
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline brex_migration_pipeline show --dashboard
    ```
    
6. üêç **Build a Notebook with data explorations and reports**

    With the pipeline and data partially validated, you can continue with custom data explorations and reports. To get started, paste the snippet below into a new marimo Notebook and ask your LLM to go from there. Jupyter Notebooks and regular Python scripts are supported as well.

    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("brex_migration_pipeline").dataset()
   # get ser table as Pandas frame
   data.ser.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

It's crucial to note that most Brex APIs require admin access, and exceeding rate limits will result in HTTP 429 errors. Additionally, access tokens expire after one hour and must be refreshed periodically. User tokens can also expire if not used for 90 days. The API employs strict measures against duplicate operations, necessitating idempotency keys for certain requests.
