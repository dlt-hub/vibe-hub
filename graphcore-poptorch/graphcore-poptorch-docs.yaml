notes:
- This function doesn’t check if the IPU is free or already being used.
- Raise an exception if no hardware is available.
- PopTorch is included with the Poplar SDK.
- All tensor data types and shapes must be constant for the entire dataset.
- PopTorch compiles to a static graph, it cannot handle control flow variations within
  the model.
- Not all PyTorch operations are implemented within the PopTorch compiler.
- pip >= 18.1 is required for PopTorch dependencies to be installed properly.
- To ensure version compatibility, torchvision and torchaudio are automatically installed
  with PopTorch in Poplar SDK 3.3 and later.
- PopTorch does not directly use the Python implementation of the optimizers.
- Built-in implementations are used in their place.
- This means that you cannot currently use custom optimizers.
- Subclassing a built-in optimizer will generate a warning.
- Any custom behaviour in a custom optimizer is unlikely to take effect, other than
  simply setting the existing attributes.
- You can change how PopTorch compiles and executes models using Options.
- You can choose to use the IPU Model instead of IPU hardware.
- By default, PopTorch will only return the final batch of outputs.
- In general, we advise pipelining over as few IPUs as possible.
- PopTorch requires setup of connected app in api
- IPUs should be reserved in powers of 2
- Uses PopTorch for model execution strategies.
- By default PopTorch will re-compile the model every time you instantiate a model.
- The cache directory might grow large quickly because PopTorch doesn’t delete old
  models from the cache.
- Failure to use DataLoader may result in accidentally changing the effective batch
  size for operations which depend on it, such as batch normalization.
- When running an inferenceModel with PipelinedExecution, you must set deviceIterations
  to at least the number of pipeline steps.
- Handling of float16 operations has been greatly simplified since PopTorch version
  3.0.
- Legacy PopTorch code using float16 can be updated for the dispatcher frontend.
- The entries in PopTorch’s optimiser state_dict() may differ from those in PyTorch
  in both name and structure.
- Poplar supports prefetching and multibuffering to improve I/O performance.
- Prefetch is enabled by default in Poplar.
- Using multibuffering is especially useful when you see large StreamCopyBegin or
  StreamCopyEnd phases in your application’s profile.
- Requires installation of the Poplar SDK
- Training and validation batch sizes are configurable
- DataLoader will automatically select a different subset of the dataset based on
  the process ID.
- All the processes must use the same seed if shuffle=True is used for the DataLoader.
- The representation is in terms of supertile (group of 4 tiles), arranged by tile
  column and distance from the exchange.
- Identifying one tile that is not of a particular sync type for an IPU or group of
  IPUs can help you target debug.
- GCDA options are specified in JSON format using environment variable GCDA_OPTIONS.
- Some options can also be specified with their own environment variables.
- This command generates device definitions for docker run command.
- By default a container is started with ‘docker run {docker_opts}’.
- If –echo option is defined, the docker command is displayed.
- You can set the path to docker with –binary option.
- By default ‘–ipc=host’ will be set.
- Everything after ‘–’ is passed directly to docker run.
- This tool tests the IPU-Exchange fabric inside an IPU, ensuring that data can move
  properly between all the tile processors and memory locations.
- The tool supports Mk2 architectures only.
- The tool reports benchmark results in teraFLOPS.
- This program is only applicable to IPU-POD systems where IPU-POD racks have been
  connected by GW-Links.
- This mode is not meant for general use.
- 'If the message ''Warning: SPCR.GSBGS2DIR is not set to SREQ_OUTPUT'' is displayed,
  it means that the sync configuration of the partition is incorrect and the test
  will most likely fail.'
- The tool tests the sync latency between host and IPU in microseconds.
- Use the -j option for JSON output
- Default number of tiles is 32
- Default number of iterations is 100000
- Default number of 64 byte blocks per transfer is 4
- gc-inventory does not require exclusive access to devices, so can be used while
  IPUs are in use.
- By default, gc-inventory only displays information about IPUs in the current active
  partition.
- The `--device0` and `--device1` arguments must be IDs for single IPUs, not groups
  of IPUs.
- On IPU-POD systems, the IPU-Links are trained when the partition is created.
- When running `gc-links`, the output will show the status of links.
- Tests all the tile memory in an IPU, reporting any tiles that fail.
- By default, gc-monitor only displays information about the current active partition.
- By default, IPU applications do not read power and temperature sensors, so this
  information will not be available in gc-monitor. To enable sensor reading the application
  must be launched with the GCDA_MONITOR environment variable set.
- The program runs indefinitely until killed (with `Ctrl-C`).
- It can be run multiple times to start code on other IPUs.
- Temperatures are reported in degrees Celsius.
- After running `gc-powertest` it’s a good idea to reset the IPUs using the gc-reset
  tool.
- When tearing down links, device ID is the MultiIPU group you want to untrain the
  links for. Typically you would want to use the biggest MultiIPU group.
- Links cannot be torn down on IPUoF partitions; using the -t option on these platforms
  will have no effect.
- By default, the embedded firmware of a C600 will attempt to limit the power consumption
  to 192 watts.
- The normal IPU clock speed in a C600 is 1500 MHz.
- Attributes can be queried programmatically (from C++, Python or Go) with the gcipuinfo
  library.
- 'The file must have the following format: {"ipu_card_mapping": ["0000:8c:00.0",
  "0000:8a:00.0", "0000:c4:00.0", "0000:c5:00.0", "0000:1b:00.0", "0000:1c:00.0",
  "0000:48:00.0", "0000:49:00.0"]}'
- To discover the ordering, visually inspect the C600 cards within the chassis.
- Setting availableMemoryProportion to a very small value can cause a large imbalance
  in tile usage.
- By default, availableMemoryProportion is 0.6 (60% of tile memory), which works well
  in most cases.
- From SDK 2.1 onwards, setting "autoReport.all":"true" will automatically set "debug.allowOutOfMemory":"true".
- The PopLibs documentation for poplin::createWeights() recommends that you do not
  set the available memory proportion below a value of 0.05.
- In TensorFlow, set availableMemoryProportion as a global convolution or matmul option
  using IPUConfig.
- In PyTorch, use setAvailableMemoryProportion() per IPU or set_available_memory()
  per operator.
- In PopART, set the available memory proportion using setAvailableMemoryProportion()
  method of the Builder object.
- Searching from the top-level index page will search all documents.
- Searching from a specific document will search only that document.
