auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://glinteco.com/en/post/secure-and-efficient-authentication-with-fastapi-integrating-jwt-for-web-applications/
  : - FastAPI-JWT-Auth is used for JWT-based authentication. The login endpoint accepts
      username and password credentials, validates them against hardcoded values ("joevu"
      / "glinteco"), and returns a JWT access token via the create_access_token method
      with the username as subject. Protected endpoints use the jwt_required() method
      to validate that a valid JWT access token is present in the request headers,
      and retrieve the authenticated user via get_jwt_subject(). The secret key for
      signing tokens is configured via the authjwt_secret_key setting in the Settings
      class, which defaults to "secret" but should be loaded from environment variables
      in production. AuthJWTException is handled globally to return appropriate error
      responses.
    - FastAPI-JWT-Extended authentication using JWT tokens. Access tokens are created
      via a login endpoint and required in request headers (via jwt_required()) to
      access protected endpoints. Token denylist checking is enabled for both access
      and refresh tokens via jti claim validation.
    - 'JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
      It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. FastAPI provides
      support for JWT authentication along with OAuth and other authentication methods.'
    - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Access tokens are obtained
      via POST /login with username and password credentials, then used in subsequent
      requests. Protected endpoints require a valid JWT access token in the request
      headers (via jwt_required()). Refresh tokens can be used at POST /refresh to
      obtain new access tokens via jwt_refresh_token_required(). The AuthJWT dependency
      handles token validation and subject extraction via get_jwt_subject().
    - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. Access tokens are obtained
      via a POST request to the /login endpoint with username and password credentials.
      Protected endpoints require a valid JWT access token sent in the request headers,
      validated using the jwt_required() method. The token subject (typically username)
      can be retrieved using get_jwt_subject(). Token refresh functionality is supported
      to extend token validity without requiring re-authentication.
