auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.getivy.de/reference/authentication:
  - Ivy authenticates API requests using an API Key passed in the X-Ivy-Api-Key header.
    All requests must be made over HTTPS, and requests without authentication will
    fail with a 401 error if the key is incorrect or outdated. Separate API Keys are
    required for Sandbox mode (base URL https://api.sand.getivy.de) and Production
    mode (base URL https://api.getivy.de).
  - 'Ivy uses API key authentication for standard requests and HMAC-SHA256 signature
    verification for webhooks. API requests require the X-IVY-API-KEY header with
    your generated API key. Webhook requests from Ivy include an X-Ivy-Signature header
    that must be validated using HMAC-SHA256 with your Webhook Signing Secret obtained
    from the Ivy Dashboard.


    For API requests: Include header X-IVY-API-KEY with your api-key value.


    For webhook validation: Extract the X-Ivy-Signature header from incoming requests,
    obtain your Webhook Signing Secret from the Ivy Dashboard, calculate HMAC-SHA256
    using the request body and Webhook Signing Secret, then compare the calculated
    signature against the X-Ivy-Signature header value to verify the request originates
    from Ivy.'
