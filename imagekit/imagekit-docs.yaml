auth_info:
- information_source; https://imagekit.io/blog/video-upload-api/:
  - Using public and private API keys for authentication. The server-side upload endpoint
    at https://upload.imagekit.io/api/v1/files/upload requires both public and private
    API keys for authentication. Client-side uploads use a different authentication
    method (signature-based) and must not expose the private key.
- information_source; https://imagekit.io/docs/api-keys:
  - Authentication to the ImageKit API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your
    private API key as the basic auth username value with no password required. In
    Python requests, use the auth parameter with a tuple of your private_api_key and
    an empty string, or set the Authorization header to "Basic " followed by the base64-encoded
    string of "private_api_key:". Standard keys have read and write access to all
    APIs, while restricted keys allow configurable access levels (None, Read only,
    Read and write) per resource.
- information_source; https://imagekit.io/docs/api-overview:
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with your private API key as the username
    and an empty password. Provide credentials either via the `-u` flag (username:empty_password
    format) or in the Authorization header as base64-encoded `private_api_key:` (note
    the required colon). All requests must use HTTPS. The Authorization header format
    is `Authorization: Basic <base64(private_api_key:)>`.'
  - 'ImageKit.io API uses HTTP Basic Auth with a private API key. Include your private
    API key as the username in the Authorization header using the format "Authorization:
    Basic base64(api_key:)" where the password is left empty. If no valid API key
    is provided or an incorrect key is used, the API returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
    API keys can be found in the ImageKit.io dashboard under the developer''s tab.'
- information_source; https://imagekit.io/docs/api-reference:
  - ImageKit API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with API keys. Provide your private
    API key (prefix `private_`) as the basic auth username in the Authorization header
    with the format "Basic <base64(api_key:)>". Public keys (prefix `public_`) and
    restricted API keys are also available. Do not send a password; only the API key
    is required as the username portion of basic auth credentials.
