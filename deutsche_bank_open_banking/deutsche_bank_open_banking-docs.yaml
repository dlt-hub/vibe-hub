auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.db.com/apidocumentation/apimerchantsolution/api-reference:
  - Authorization token obtained from AccessTokenRequest must be sent in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The token acquisition requires client_id, client_secret,
    grant_type, and scope parameters URL-encoded in the request body, and the response
    provides access_token with token_type (Bearer) and expiration details (expires_in,
    expires_on).
  - 'Merchant authentication is performed using a Merchant-ID header parameter (stringminLength:
    10 characters) that must be included in requests. The Merchant-ID serves as the
    unique identifier for merchant authentication.'
  - Merchant authentication is required via the Merchant-ID header, which must be
    a string with a minimum length of 10 characters and serves as unique identification
    for the merchant making the request.
  - Merchant-ID header is required for authentication, sent as a unique identifier
    with minimum length of 10 characters. The API also returns 401 Unauthorized and
    403 Forbidden responses, indicating token or permission-based access control is
    in place, though specific credential details are not provided in this excerpt.
  - Merchant-ID header is required for authentication. Include a unique merchant identifier
    with minimum length of 10 characters in the Merchant-ID request header to identify
    your merchant account.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.db.com/apidocumentation/apimerchantsolution/api-reference:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset (int32) specifies rows
    to skip, limit (int32) specifies maximum results per request. Response structure
    for pagination details is not provided in this documentation.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset (int32) specifies the
    number of rows to skip, and limit (int32) specifies the maximum number of results
    to return per request. Move to the next page by incrementing offset by the limit
    value.
  - 'The endpoint uses offset-based pagination with limit and offset query parameters
    (both integer format: int32). The limit parameter specifies the maximum number
    of results to return, and offset specifies the number of rows to skip. The response
    type is PSD2BankResults, which presumably contains the paginated bank data.'
  - The endpoint uses query parameters limit (maximum number of results) and offset
    (number of rows to skip) for pagination. The response is a PSD2BankResults object
    containing paged data.
  - The response includes pagination metadata with limit, offset, and total fields.
    To paginate, use limit and offset as query parameters in subsequent requests;
    limit defaults to 2 and offset starts at 0, incrementing by limit to retrieve
    the next page until offset reaches total.
