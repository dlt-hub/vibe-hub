notes:
- VCF PowerCLI is now reimagined to align with VMware Cloud Foundation’s unified automation
  journey.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Broadcom
- The easiest and recommended way to install VCF SDK is from PYPI `pip install vcf-sdk`.
- 'Java Compatibility: The VCF Java SDK for 9.0 is compatible with the latest supported
  Java LTS versions: 11, 17, 21. It is strongly recommended to use one of those versions
  when integrating the SDK into custom applications and when running the samples.'
