  - 'API key authentication is required, passed via the `X-BigOven-API-Key` header
    with your API key value. The key should be included in request headers as `X-BigOven-API-Key:
    your-key-here`.'
  - The API uses standard authentication headers to identify the current user ("me").
    The exact header name and format are not specified in this excerpt, but the documentation
    indicates that authentication is required and the user identity is determined
    by standard authentication headers passed with requests.
