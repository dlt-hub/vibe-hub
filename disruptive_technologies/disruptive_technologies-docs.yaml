auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/api:
  - All requests to the Disruptive Technologies REST API must be authenticated using
    a Service Account with either basic auth or OAuth2. Service Account authentication
    uses basic auth credentials, while DT Studio User Account authentication uses
    OAuth2. Refer to the linked authentication documentation for specific header names,
    token acquisition, and scoping details.
- information_source; https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/api/emulator:
  - All requests to the Disruptive Technologies emulator REST API must be authenticated
    using a Service Account. You can authenticate either with a Service Account using
    basic auth, or with a DT Studio User Account using OAuth2. Refer to the Service
    Accounts introduction and OAuth2 authentication documentation for specific header
    names, credential formats, and token acquisition details.
- information_source; https://docs.developer.disruptive-technologies.com/authentication/basic-auth:
  - Basic authentication is required using Service Account credentials. Send the Service
    Account Key ID and Secret as HTTP Basic Auth (username:password format) in the
    Authorization header, or via the -u flag in curl. The credentials are typically
    stored in environment variables DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID and DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET.
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Credentials are provided via environment
    variables DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID (username) and DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET (password),
    passed to the Authorization header using the Basic auth scheme via the SetBasicAuth
    method or equivalent base64-encoded "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>"
    header.'
- information_source; https://docs.developer.disruptive-technologies.com/examples/pagination:
  - Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with service account credentials. Set environment
    variables DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID and DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET, then pass them
    as the auth tuple (key_id, secret) to the requests library's auth parameter for
    GET requests to the API endpoint https://api.d21s.com/v2.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.developer.disruptive-technologies.com/examples/pagination:
  - Pagination uses a pageToken parameter in the query string. Send requests with
    an empty pageToken initially, then use the pageToken value from the response to
    fetch subsequent pages. Continue looping until no pageToken is returned in the
    response, indicating the final page has been reached.
  - Pagination uses a pageToken parameter passed in the query string. The response
    includes a nextPageToken field; if it has a non-empty value, use it as the pageToken
    in the next request, otherwise stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses a token-based scheme with a `pageToken` query parameter (initially
    empty string) sent in GET requests. The response contains paginated results in
    a field specified by the API endpoint, and a `pageToken` value for the next page;
    loop continues until `pageToken` is absent or empty.
  - Projects are fetched in groups of 100 at a time using pagination. The documentation
    mentions iterating through paginated results until all projects are retrieved,
    but does not explicitly specify the pagination parameter names, response fields,
    or stopping conditions.
- information_source; https://docs.developer.disruptive-technologies.com/explore-our-rest-api/with-postman:
  - The API uses token-based pagination. Request the next page by including the nextPageToken
    value from the previous response as a query parameter in the subsequent request.
    When nextPageToken is empty, all results have been retrieved.
