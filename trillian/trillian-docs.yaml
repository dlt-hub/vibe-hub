  - All requests to the Trillian Server API must be authenticated by appending a token
    parameter to the URL as a query string parameter. The exact parameter name is
    token and it should be included in every request URL, for example https://api.trillian.im/v2/endpoint?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN.
    Requests without a valid API token will result in a 401 Not Authorized response.
  - All requests to the Trillian Server API must be authenticated by appending a token
    parameter to the URL query string. The token parameter should contain the authentication
    token value, for example token=AVS%2Fw8J7UELk4Q9pB5iz66p9J8WTbNZprvYO%2F7wOUekj9JfiMjs3A46qoefKRGMGeqUmWYVapz7UBpKXNbW3P62C4vhzy%2B3XEVcvXxh8ebKf9RXJDhXMeWzJwcwh4zuI6PgWnBKZRYiTWk6c%2B98cWdY8bjTm8j%2FG4wI9%2Foex%2FVVh.
  - Trillian Server uses API key authentication. The API key must be passed as a query
    parameter named `api_key` in GET requests to the API endpoint at https://api.trillian.im
    or your configured in-house server domain. All API access requires HTTPS.
