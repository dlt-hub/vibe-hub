notes:
- API credit costs will vary depending on the image size, model and features such
  as Alchemy.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- If using the seed parameter, the maximum seed number is 2147483638.
- FLUX.1 Kontext [pro] costs 34 API Credits per image.
- 'Alchemy needs to be set to true (e.g`"alchemy": true`)'
- This feature allows for uploaded or generated Images as reference, apply ControlNet
  and add finer adjustments to your image appearance.
- Image to Image with multiple ControlNets is incompatible with most SDXL models,
  except for Style Reference (67) and Character Reference (133) Preprocessor IDs.
- Image dimensions for images uploaded to canvasInitId and canvasMaskId must be divisible
  by 8.
- Ensure canvasRequest is set to True when using Canvas Editor features.
- Masks must be uploaded as a white element against a black background.
- Realtime Canvas uses Latent Consistency Model (LCM) for fast generation.
- The Fantasy Avatar Feature will be deprecating in the near future.
- Transparency feature enables generation of images with a transparent background.
- Veo3 720p generates at an aspect ratio of 16:9 at dimensions 1280x720.
- Veo3 1080p generates at an aspect ratio of 16:9 at dimensions 1920x1080.
- 'Default Dimension: Veo3 720p generates at an aspect ratio of 16:9 at dimensions
  1280x720.'
- To set resolution to 720p, apply RESOLUTION_720 to the resolution parameter.
- To set model to Motion 2.0 Fast, apply MOTION2FAST to the model parameter.
- Aspect ratio dimensions in 720p may not reflect the actual output dimensions
- Image-to-Video endpoint costs 200 API Credits per 480p video, and 300 API Credits
  per 720p video.
- Be sure to use the id from the Get Single Generation API call as the imageId in
  your request.
- The maximum upscaled image size is 20MP.
- Only 3D models in .OBJ format can be accepted as the file extension.
- Models need to have a UV mapping to generate Textures.
- The `prompt` parameter of the Improve Prompt endpoint has a limit of 200 characters
- Training process may take from several minutes to a few hours depending on the number
  of images and training settings.
- The webhook callback URL field requires HTTPS.
- To update your webhook callback URL and webhook callback API key, you need to create
  a new production API key with the new webhook details, then delete the old one after
  switching to the new API key.
- Leonardo.Ai continuously improves safeguards against NSFW generations.
- Stable Diffusion v1.5 (SD1.5) and Platform Models based on SD1.5 are known to be
  prone to generate NSFW.
- Concurrency refers to the number of active kitchen stations or stoves, each able
  to prepare a dish simultaneously.
- Queue/Pending Limit represents how many dish orders the kitchen will accept and
  keep in line for cooking when all stations are busy.
- API Rate Limit is like how many waiters are available to take new orders from the
  dining area.
- Forecast your usage and plan how much API credits you need.
- Image generation takes a few seconds so you would need to implement a wait and retry
  logic until status says COMPLETE or FAILED.
- No, images generated via the Leonardo.Ai API will not expire and can also be accessed
  from the Web App at any time.
- The parameter imagePrompts accepts an array of image IDs as a string.
- Extension parameter in the Upload Init Image API accepts png, jpg, jpeg, or webp.
- Images generated via the Leonardo.Ai API will not expire.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Leonardo.Ai continuously releases new models and elements.
- The presigned URL expires in 2 minutes, so the method must be run within the first
  2 minutes.
- The image must be in the format of the extension provided to the init image method.
- Get in touch with our friendly support team for personalised assistance and guidance
- The URL for this request expired after 30 days.
- Get a list of public Elements available for use with generations.
- The prompt used to generate images defaults to A majestic cat in the snow.
- The number of images to generate defaults to 4.
- URL for this request expired after 30 days.
- The resolution of the video defaults to RESOLUTION_480 if not specified.
- The model defaults to MOTION2 if not specified.
- Query parameters to be provided in the request body as a JSON object
- The width and height must be 512, 640 or 1024.
- The style to generate LCM images includes ANIMECINEMATICDIGITAL_ARTDYNAMICENVIRONMENTFANTASY_ARTILLUSTRATIONPHOTOGRAPHYRENDER_3DRAYTRACEDSKETCH_BWSKETCH_COLORVIBRANTNONE
- This endpoint will create a no background variation of the provided image ID.
- 1 concurrency comes with 10 create a generation of images requests
- Default concurrency can be increased on a custom API plan.
- This endpoint returns presigned details to upload an init image to S3
- This endpoint will train a new custom model
