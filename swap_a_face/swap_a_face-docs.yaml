auth_info:
- information_source; https://swapaface.com/blog/swapaface-api-integration-guide-2025:
  - API key authentication using Bearer token in Authorization header and user ID
    in custom header. Pass api_key as Bearer token in Authorization header and user_id
    in x-user-id header with all requests.
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication via the Authorization header
    and a user UUID via the x-user-id header. Include Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
    and x-user-id: user-uuid in all requests to the video face swapping endpoints.'
  - API requests require two authentication headers. The Authorization header must
    contain a Bearer token with the format "Bearer your-api-key". Additionally, the
    x-user-id header must be included with a user UUID value. Both headers are required
    for all endpoints.
  - 'All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header
    and a user ID in the x-user-id header. Send requests with Authorization: Bearer
    your-api-key and x-user-id: user-uuid headers.'
  - Authorization is required via Bearer token in the Authorization header. Include
    your API key as the Bearer token value. Additionally, provide the x-user-id header
    with the user UUID. Requests must use Content-Type application/json.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://swapaface.com/blog/swapaface-api-integration-guide-2025:
  - Pagination uses limit (max 100, default 20) and offset (default 0) query parameters.
    Response includes paginated results of video face swap operations.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, max 100, default 20) and offset (query
    parameter, default 0) to control page size and position. The response contains
    an images array; construct the next request by incrementing offset by the limit
    value until fewer results than limit are returned, indicating the final page.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The limit parameter accepts
    a maximum of 100 with a default of 20, and offset defaults to 0 for skipping results.
    The response includes a pagination object with total count, current limit, current
    offset, and hasMore boolean to indicate if more results exist.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-limit scheme. Request parameters: limit (query, optional,
    default 20) and offset (query, optional, default 0). Response includes pagination
    object with limit, offset, and hasMore boolean to indicate if more results exist.'
  - The endpoint GET /api/v1/image-to-videos uses offset-based pagination with query
    parameters limit (max 100, default 20) and offset (default 0). The response includes
    a pagination object with limit, offset, and hasMore fields; continue pagination
    while hasMore is true and increment offset by limit for the next request.
