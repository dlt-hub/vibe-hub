  - HTTP Basic authentication is enabled for endpoints under `/api/users/**`, which
    requires credentials sent via the Authorization header in the format "Basic base64(username:password)".
    JWT authentication is also mentioned as an alternative approach using JSON Web
    Tokens for stateless authentication, with dependencies spring-boot-starter-security
    and jjwt required for implementation.
- information_source; https://www.dhiwise.com/post/groq-api-fastest-llm:
