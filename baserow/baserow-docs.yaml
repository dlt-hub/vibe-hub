auth_info:
- information_source; https://baserow.io/docs/apis/rest-api:
  - JWT token-based authentication is required. Obtain a token by POST to /api/user/token-auth/
    with username and password in the JSON body, then include the token in the Authorization
    header as "JWT {TOKEN}" for all subsequent requests. Tokens are valid for 60 minutes
    and can be refreshed using the token refresh endpoint.
  - To authorize API requests, you need a JWT token obtained by sending POST /api/user/token-auth/
    with your email and password credentials. The token should then be included in
    the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for subsequent API requests. You
    can also create database tokens with specific permissions via POST /api/database/tokens/
    for safer public data exposure.
- information_source; https://api.baserow.io/api/redoc/:
  - 'Access to this endpoint requires one of three authentication methods: UserSource
    JWT, JWT, or Database token. The specific mechanism for providing these credentials
    is not detailed in the provided documentation chunk.'
  - Authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Token) passed as a bearer token. Include the
    JWT token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" when making requests
    to these endpoints.
  - Authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Token) passed as a bearer token. The exact header
    name and format are not explicitly specified in this documentation excerpt, but
    standard practice for JWT endpoints is to include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}". The API requires valid user authentication via JWT
    to access MCP endpoint operations.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.baserow.io/api/redoc/:
  - 'Pagination uses either page-based or offset-based schemes. For page-based: use
    query parameter page (integer). For offset-based: use query parameters limit (integer,
    defines row count) and offset (integer, used with limit to define starting position).
    Either page or limit can be provided, not both.'
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, default 100) and offset (integer, default 0) query
    parameters. The response includes count, next, previous, and results fields to
    navigate between pages.
  - Pagination uses offset-based approach with page and size parameters. The page
    parameter defines which page to return, and size defines rows per page; either
    page or limit can be provided, not both. The response includes count field for
    total results and next field containing the URL for the next page.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (page number) and size (entries
    per page). The response structure is not shown, but these parameters control which
    audit log entries are returned.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, defines which page to return)
    and size (integer, defines users per page). Response includes count (total), next
    (URL to next page), previous (URL to previous page), and results array containing
    the paginated data.
