    parameter or form field named access_key. The access key is obtained from your
    ApiFlash account and must be included with every request to the API endpoint at
    https://api.apiflash.com/v1/urltoimage.
  - The API uses an access key for authentication passed as a query parameter named
    access_key. The access key must be included in API requests, for example as access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    in the query string of the endpoint URL.
