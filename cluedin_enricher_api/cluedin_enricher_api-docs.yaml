auth_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.cluedin.net/integration/endpoint:
  - HTTP POST requests to CluedIn require Bearer token authentication. Include the
    Authorization header with value Bearer <Your API token>, where the API token is
    obtained from Administration > API Tokens in CluedIn. The Content-Type header
    must be set to application/json, and the request body should contain raw data
    in JSON format.
- information_source; https://documentation.cluedin.net/kb/cluedin-for-developers:
  - "Personal Access Tokens (PAT) are used for authentication, created in Admin \u2192\
    \ API Tokens with minimal scopes and expiry, and stored securely in a secret manager.\
    \ Requests must include the Authorization header with Bearer token format, plus\
    \ X-Correlation-Id and Content-Type headers. The token grants scopes such as ingest:write,\
    \ export:read, and policy:read that control what operations are permitted."
  - Use OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow to obtain tokens. Send a POST request to
    /oauth/token with grant_type set to "client_credentials", client_id, client_secret,
    and scope parameters. Include the resulting access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <token>" for subsequent API calls.
  - Webhook requests include HMAC-SHA256 signatures for verification. The webhook
    registration accepts a secret parameter, and signature verification uses crypto.createHmac
    with "sha256" algorithm on the request body using the registered secret to produce
    a hex digest for comparison.
- information_source; https://documentation.cluedin.net/preparation/enricher/enricher-reference:
  - Basic authentication is required for the CVR enricher. Credentials must be provided
    as username and password in the URL using the format http://{username}:{password}@distribution.virk.dk/cvr-permanent/_search,
    where {username} and {password} are the actual credentials embedded in the request
    URL.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.cluedin.net/kb/cluedin-for-developers:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with limit and cursor query parameters. The response
    includes items array and next_cursor field; use next_cursor value in the cursor
    parameter of the next request to fetch additional pages.
- information_source; https://documentation.cluedin.net/preparation/enricher/enricher-reference:
  - The Gleif enricher uses query parameter pagination with page[size] and page[number]
    parameters in the query string. The endpoint example shows page[size]=1&page[number]=1,
    indicating these parameters control page size and page number respectively, though
    specific defaults, minimums, maximums, and response pagination fields are not
    documented.
