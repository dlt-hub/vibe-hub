auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.bitrue.com/api-docs:
  - API key authentication is required for certain endpoints. The API key is passed
    via the X-CH-APIKEY header. For TRADE and USER_DATA endpoints, an additional HMAC
    SHA256 signature must be included in the X-CH-SIGN header, using the API secret
    as the key.
  - 'HMAC SHA256 signature-based authentication using API-KEY and API-Secret. Include
    three required headers: X-CH-TS with unix timestamp in milliseconds, X-CH-SIGN
    with the signature computed as HMAC-SHA256(API-Secret, timestamp + method + requestPath
    + body), and optionally X-CH-RECVWINDOW for request validity window in milliseconds
    (defaults to 5000). Method must be uppercase (GET/POST), requestPath is the endpoint
    path like /sapi/v1/order, and body is the request body string for POST requests
    only. Server rejects requests where timestamp is more than 1 second in the future
    or outside the recvWindow tolerance.'
- information_source; https://www.bitrue.com/api_docs_includes_file/delivery/index.html:
  - API Key and HMAC SHA256 signature authentication required. Send apiKey in the
    X-API-KEY header and compute HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request timestamp, HTTP
    method, endpoint path, and JSON body using your secretKey, then include the signature
    in the request. Include a recvWindow parameter (recommended 5000ms or less) to
    specify request validity window.
  - API key is passed in the `X-CH-APIKEY` header. HMAC SHA256 signature is computed
    from timestamp + method + requestPath + body, then sent in the `X-CH-SIGN` header.
    Timestamp in unix milliseconds goes in the `X-CH-TS` header. Requests are valid
    within recvWindow milliseconds (default 5000) of the timestamp, and server time
    must not be more than 1 second ahead of client time.
  - API keys are passed via the `X-CH-APIKEY` header. For TRADE and USER_DATA endpoints,
    requests must be signed using HMAC SHA256 with the API-Secret as the key. The
    signature is computed from timestamp + method + requestPath + body, then sent
    in the `X-CH-SIGN` header. API keys and secret keys are case sensitive.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.bitrue.com/api_docs_includes_file/delivery/index.html:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: endIdx (float, returns data before
    specified timestamp) and pageSize (float, max 300, specifies number of records
    per request). Response structure not fully detailed, but endIdx appears to control
    pagination position by timestamp.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (optional, default 1) and limit (optional,
    default 10, maximum 200). The response returns data in an array field but does
    not include explicit pagination metadata like next, total_count, or has_more,
    so pagination state must be inferred from result count relative to the limit parameter.
  - The `/dapi/v1/klines` endpoint has a `limit` parameter (integer, optional, default
    100, max 300) that controls pagination by specifying the number of candlestick
    records returned per request. No response fields or headers indicate how to fetch
    subsequent pages.
- information_source; https://www.bitrue.com/api_docs_includes_file/futures/index.html:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters endIdx (timestamp threshold for data
    before that point) and pageSize (specifies number of results, up to 300 maximum).
    Response structure not detailed, but endIdx appears to be used for iterating through
    historical data by setting it to earlier timestamps.
