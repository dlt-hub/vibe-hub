- Once data has been archived, it cannot be re-ingested.
- The process of archiving large amounts of data can take several days to complete.
- You need a Domain Account to set up event sources like LDAP and Active Directory.
- SIEM (InsightIDR) uses log data from those event sources to properly attribute all
  of your organization’s events to the users involved and to add context to analytics.
- The easiest way to acquire these logs is to use a Domain Admin account to query
  the Domain Controllers.
- Some restrictions in your environment may require that you query the Domain Controllers
  using a non-admin account.
- A Collector cannot have more than one event source configured using the same UDP
  or TCP port with the Listen on Network Port data collection method.
- The port specified must be unique for the Collector that is collecting the logs.

  highly suspicious.
- All quarantine asset response actions can be configured to run in the cloud, without
  deploying an Automation (InsightConnect) orchestrator.
- Select Listen on Network Port as your Collection Method.
- In the Port field, enter a port number that is not overloaded. For example, you
  could use port 65218.
- SIEM (InsightIDR) will only process UEF events that meet the exact format stipulated
  for a given event_type and version.
- If the logs do not contain the required information or violate the contract of the
  UEF, SIEM (InsightIDR) will not parse the logs.
- Uses IAM Roles instead of IAM Keys for secure communication.
- All date and time details are processed using the UTC time zone.

- 'Ensure that you have set up the Microsoft Active Directory Security Logs event
  source and that your Active Directory audit policy is set to capture the following
  Windows event codes: `4662`, `4768`, `4769`.'
- Select the Send Unparsed Data check box for each of your Microsoft Active Directory
  Security Logs event sources to send raw logs to Log Search.
- Make the honey accounts look as realistic as your other Active Directory objects.
  The naming convention of honey objects should match the normal Active Directory
  accounts.
- Avoid unnecessary noise and false positive detections

  settings.
- Quotation marks are used to enclose a search value in a query.
- If the value you are searching for contains a space, you must use double quotes.
- If the value you are searching for contains a single quote in the value, you must
  use double quotes to enclose the value.
- If the value you are searching for contains a double quote, you must use single
  quotes to enclose the value.
- You can also use triple quotes regardless of the types of quotes the value contains.
- Numeric values in queries must be in signed or unsigned integers, floating-point
  values, simple or scientific notation.
- Regex must be wrapped with two forward slashes.
- Logical operators are treated as case-insensitive.
- You can use NOT or ! along with comparison operators to exclude data from your query
  results.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token - requires setup of connected app in api
- Queries are case-insensitive.
- Performance may vary based on the complexity of the queries.
- Variables can be referenced only in the where() clause and support only a select
  number of operators.
- Once your parsing rule is created, you can expect a 5-10 minute delay before your
  parsed data shows up in Log Search.
- Previously collected data will not be parsed with your new parsing rules. Only data
  collected after the parsing rules are implemented will be parsed with them.
- Parsing rules can impact current dashboards. You will need to check your filters
  to assess how the parsing rules will impact your dashboards and basic detections.
- Edits to a parsing rule are not applied retroactively. Older logs will not be updated.
  It may take up to 10 minutes for your edited rule to be applied to new logs.
- Data that is parsed with a custom parsing rule appears in Log Search with a “custom_data”
  tag in the log entry. If your data does not appear in Log Search, it could indicate
  an issue with your parsing rule.
