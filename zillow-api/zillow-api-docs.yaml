- NLTK is a powerful library for natural language processing tasks.
- GridSearchCV automates the process of hyperparameter tuning by exhaustively searching
  through a predefined grid of parameter combinations.
- Uses API Key for authentication
- The model used is 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
- DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can also be used for outlier
  detection.
- DBSCAN can detect outliers in datasets that have complex shapes or patterns.
- DBSCAN can differentiate between noise points and actual outliers.
- 'DBSCAN requires tuning of two parameters: min_samples and epsilon.'
- Time series data requires proper formatting and cleaning before analysis.
- Scipy.ndimage is a powerful library for image processing in Python.
- It provides a wide range of functions for operations such as filtering, segmentation,
  and morphology.
