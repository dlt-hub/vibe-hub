auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/contract-p.fit/1.0/openapi.json:
  - 'All endpoints are protected and require one of three authentication mechanisms:
    HTTP Basic Auth using username and password, JWT Token sent in the Authorization
    header, or API-Key sent as a header. Users must have appropriate RBAC-based scoped
    roles to access resources, with permissions that can be restricted to specific
    inboxes or documents.'
  - Bearer tokens are used for authentication. Create tokens via POST /auth/token
    with a request body containing token details. Requires edit_users permission;
    users with sufficient privileges can create tokens for other users, otherwise
    only for themselves.
  - 'Permission required: edit_predictor_settings. Operations return 403 Forbidden
    if the user lacks sufficient permissions. This indicates role-based access control
    where specific permissions must be granted to perform certain actions.'
  - Permission-based authorization is required for this endpoint. The edit_predictor_settings
    permission must be granted to access the POST operation on this resource. A 403
    Forbidden response is returned if the user lacks sufficient permissions.
  - 'The Contract.fit API supports two authentication methods: HTTP basic authentication
    or token-based authentication. Credentials should be sent with each request using
    either basic auth headers or a token parameter/header as specified in the API
    implementation details.'
