notes:
- TTAPI Contains Midjourney API, Dalle3 API (unofficial), Face Swap API.
- TTAPI is a relatively stable (operating for more than a year) and the most affordable
  Midjourney API service provider on the market.
- Our price is at least 60-80% off his
- We have no limit on the usage speed
- High concurrent calls are prohibited.
- TTAPI outputs a complete set of interface services in the form of API through the
  Midjourney account in the agent operating platform
- You only need to pay per image you generate
- The length of generated video and the length of the continued video are currently
  fixed at 5s.
- This endpoint is an asynchronous task.
- Expiration restrictions on the images returned by Dalle3. Please transfer the images
  yourself when using them.
- Uses API Key for request authorization
- 'PPU Mode: Pay for Per Use, only need TTAPI quotas to use Midjourney API, and the
  domain is https://api.ttapi.io'
- 'Hold Account Mode: Host your Midjourney & Discord account via TTAPI to use the
  Midjourney API, and the domain is https://hold.ttapi.io'
- You need to have subscribed to Midjourneyâ€™s paid plan
- You need to have a discord channel that has invited Midjourney Bot
- Normally, our ability to use the API violates Discord & Midjourney's ToS rules,
  so there is such a risk, but TTAPI will try its best to avoid this problem from
  a technical perspective.
errors:
- '200400: Request was successful'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck API key or authorization'
- 'Job Timeout: TTAPI Job Timeout. Case 1: The timeout field is not set or the timeout
  field is set too small.'
- '[Banned prompt detected] Sorry! Our AI moderator thinks this...'

- 'Failed to process your command... Midjourney Bot: Failed to process your command
  :c'
- '[Invalid parameter] [Invaild link] [Invaild prompt] --no parameter must not include...'
- '[TTAPI prompt filter] [TTAPI image filter] banned prompt words...'
- '[Blocked] You have been temporarily... Account unavailable'
- '[Action needed to continue] Sorry!... Action required to continue'
- If you cannot accept the risk of your account being banned, we recommend you use
  our PPU mode
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
