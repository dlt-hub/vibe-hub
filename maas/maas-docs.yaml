auth_info:
- information_source; https://maas.io/docs/api:
  - The API accepts optional X.509 certificate and private key in the request body
    for VM host authentication. For virsh VM hosts without SSH public-key setup, username
    and password are required via power_user and power_pass fields. For LXD VM hosts,
    a certificate and key will be auto-generated if not provided, or password can
    be used if the MAAS certificate is not pre-registered on the LXD server.
  - The API uses OAuth token-based authentication. Users must first create an authorisation
    token via POST /MAAS/api/2.0/account/op-create_authorisation_token, which returns
    token_key, token_secret, consumer_key, and name. These credentials are then used
    for subsequent authenticated requests. Tokens can be managed (listed, deleted,
    updated) through dedicated account operations.
  - Token-based authentication is supported via optional token_name and token_secret
    parameters, which are used in place of password authentication. Additionally,
    basic username authentication is supported for certain chassis types (recs_box,
    seamicro15k, vmware, mscm, msftocs, ucsm, hmcz), where username is a required
    parameter for those specific types.
