notes:
- Shlink will track every time your short URLs are opened.
- Shlink can track visits to any URL that would usually result in a '404 - Not found'
  error.
- Starting with v2.6.0, Shlink can also track orphan visits.
- Shlink docker images are published both in Docker hub and Github Container Registry.
- The image comes with a working SQLite database, but in production, it’s strongly
  recommended using a distributed database.
- Generate your first API key to interact with Shlink’s API.
- FrankenPHP supports many other configuration options.
- Both Apache and Nginx are officially supported
- Shlink expects the database to be up and running when it starts.
- If you don’t provide a GeoLite2 license key, Shlink will simply not geolocate visits.
- The logic to parse secret env vars is generic, so you can use this approach with
  any existing or future environment variable.
- The use of a _FILE suffix is a convention used by popular docker images.
- If both the suffixed and non-suffixed env vars are provided, the latter will be
  ignored.
- Due to the project’s architecture, and the lack of an integrated GUI, Shlink provides
  a couple of command line tools that can be used to install or update Shlink instances,
  or even completely manage Shlink as a whole (create short URLs, see visits, manage
  domains, etc).
- 'Always pass the header Accept: application/json to prevent receiving HTML.'
- Shlink does not directly depend on the name of the folder, it’s perfectly fine to
  rename it and continue working.
- Starting with v2.8.0, Shlink allows configuring different special redirects for
  every domain.
- With Shlink v2.9.0 and newer, you can include placeholders in the URLs to redirect
  to.
- The installation tool expects to be executed on Shlink’s root directory.
- Geolocation-based rules are prone to false positives/negatives (specially by city
  name), since geolocating a visitor based on their IP address is not perfect.
- The import process is transactional and all-or-nothing.
- Shlink relies on the date of visits to determine if they have already been imported.
- Real-time updates only work with RoadRunner, which is the case if you are using
  the docker image.
- Make sure the consumer’s IP address, and the request’s domain, are forwarded from
  the proxy to Shlink.
- Shlink will send raw IP addresses to Matomo for geolocation purposes.
- Shlink will always use POST to send data to Matomo.
- Editing roles on existing API keys is not allowed, as it could lead to behavior
  inconsistencies and security breaches.
