  - OAuth2 is used for authentication. To create an OAuth client, POST to /api/v2/oauth/clients
    with supported grant types including CODE (requires client ID and secret for web
    servers), TOKEN/IMPLICIT (for browser/mobile apps), and CLIENT-CREDENTIALS (for
    non-user contexts, requires roleIds). Clients must be authorized before accessing
    PureCloud APIs.
  - OAuth2 token is required for ingestion endpoints. The token must be generated

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.euw2.pure.cloud/devapps/api-explorer:
  - Clients should send requests using the 'nextUri' value from the response and continue
    until 'nextUri' is no longer present in the response, indicating all items have
    been returned. The 'nextUri' is already URL encoded and should not be re-encoded.
  - Cursor-based pagination is used on the /api/v2/authorization/divisions/query endpoint.
    Use the "after" parameter to fetch the next page and "before" parameter to fetch
    the previous page.
  - Gets a paged list of alerts with maximum page size of 50. Use the post /api/v2/alerting/alerts/query
    endpoint with pagination parameters in the request body to retrieve paginated
    results, though specific parameter names and response fields are not detailed
    in the provided documentation.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme via the `nextUri` field in the response.
    Clients should continue sending requests using the `nextUri` value until it is
    no longer present in the response, indicating all items have been returned. The
    `nextUri` is already URL encoded and should not be re-encoded.
  - Pagination uses nextUri field in responses to indicate more results are available.
    When nextUri is present, use it to fetch the next page of calibrations. Note that
    total and pageCount counts may be inaccurate for large result sets.
