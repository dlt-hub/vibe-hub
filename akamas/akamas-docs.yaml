notes:
- Troubles in running sh scripts remotely may occur due to stderr configuration.
- 'To keep a script running in the background during the workflow, use detach: true.'
- Insights is in beta status and will be in GA soon.
- 'No agents required: no setup time, no security checks are required.'
- Akamas is fully GDPR-compliant.
- Passwords are securely stored using a one-way hash algorithm.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The maximum time in seconds to wait for a telemetry activity to be started (e.g.
  the telemetry instance job to be running) is 120 on Kubernetes and 300 on Docker.
- The maximum time in seconds to wait for a telemetry activity to be completed is
  900.
- The study template is defined using a YAML manifest.
- The Akamas CLI allows performing all the operations that you can do on the UI and
  more.
- In particular, the CLI has to be used for all modification operations on the platform,
  such as the creation and deletion of Akamas resources.
- KPIs are not an Akamas resource and are always defined as part of an optimization
  study.
- Akamas provides customizable safety policies for live optimization.
- The exploration factor is defined as a percentage (default is 5%).
- The safety factor is set by default to 0.5.
- This command is available since version 2.8.0 of the CLI
- Use the command line interface for all operations
- Long operations may require patience as they may take time to complete
- All operators accept some common, optional, arguments that allow you to control
  how the operator is executed within your workflow.
- Access on remote machines is performed using SFTP (SSH).
- If no `component` is provided, this operator will try to configure every parameter
  defined for the Components of the System under test
- The command can be anything that runs on a Windows Command Prompt
- Access on remote machines is performed using WinRM
- It is a good practice to define only queries that update the state of the database.
- Is not possible to use SELECT queries to extract data from the database.
- Databases hosted on Amazon RDS are not supported.
- The operator connects to a Spark instance invoking a spark-submit on a machine reachable
  via SSH.
- The SparkSubmit operator connects to a Spark instance and invokes a local spark-submit
  to schedule a job.
- The operator uses Livy to run Spark applications on a Spark instance.
- When a projectFile is specified, the Operator uploads the provided project to NeoLoad
  and launches the specified scenario.
- When a projectId is specified, the Operator expects the project to be already available
  on NeoLoad.
- All LoadRunner test files must be readable and writable by the user account used
  by Akamas.
- The reserved time slot for the test must be a number followed by the time unit.
  Values must be multiple of 15m and greater than 30m.
