    ApiKey {username}:{secret}. You obtain the API key by signing up for a trial account,
    requesting one from Support with details about your company, use case, and REST
    experience, then retrieving your username and secret from the web app once issued.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.legalesign.com/docs/how-to/count-of-docs/:
  - The GET /document/ endpoint uses limit (query parameter, optional, default/example
    value 1) to control page size and returns meta['total_count'] in the response
    indicating total matching documents. Use limit=1 with created_gt filter to efficiently
    retrieve total counts at different time points for calculating document metrics.
- information_source; https://apidocs.legalesign.com/docs/how-to/docs-changed/:
  - Use offset-based pagination with limit and offset query parameters. The response
    meta object contains next, previous, offset, limit, and total_count fields. Iterate
    pages by using the next URL from meta.next, or manually increment offset by the
    limit value. Stop when meta.next is null. Optional modified_gt parameter filters
    results by modification datetime.
- information_source; https://apidocs.legalesign.com/docs/rest-v1/get-groups/:
  - Use offset and limit query parameters to paginate through groups. The response
    includes meta.offset, meta.limit, meta.next, meta.previous, and meta.total_count
    to track pagination state; use meta.next or increment offset by limit to fetch
    subsequent pages until meta.next is null.
- information_source; https://apidocs.legalesign.com/docs/rest-v1/get-pdf-template-fields/:
  - The response uses offset-based pagination with query parameters limit and offset.
    The meta object contains limit, offset, total_count, next, and previous fields.
    Use the next field value to construct the subsequent request; stop when next is
    null.
