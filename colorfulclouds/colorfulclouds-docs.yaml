  - Authentication uses a token-based approach. Include your token as the first path
    segment in the API URL (e.g., `/v2.5/{token}/`), where the token is obtained by
    signing up at the dashboard. The demo token is `S45Fnpxcwyq0QT4b`, but production
    requests require your own token acquired from https://dashboard.caiyunapp.com/user/sign_up/.
  - The API requires a token passed in the URL path. The token `S45Fnpxcwyq0QT4b`
    must be included as a path segment in the format `/v2.5/{token}/{longitude},{latitude}/weather.json`.
    This token serves as the authentication credential for accessing the weather API.
  - The API uses a token-based authentication scheme where an API key is passed as
    part of the URL path. The token appears in the URL structure as `/v2.5/{token}/`
    (e.g., `S45Fnpxcwyq0QT4b` in the examples), positioned between the API version
    and the geographic coordinates. Include your API key as the path segment in all
    requests to this endpoint.
  - The API uses a token-based authentication scheme where the token is included as
    part of the URL path. The token `S45Fnpxcwyq0QT4b` appears in the URL structure
    `/v2.5/{token}/{longitude},{latitude}/weather.json`, indicating that a unique
    API token must be provided in the path segment to authenticate requests.
