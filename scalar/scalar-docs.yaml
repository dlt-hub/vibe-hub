  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with audience and scope-based permissions. Send
    POST request to https://auth.api.eu1.scalar.zf.com/v1/integrators/token with JSON
    body containing clientId, clientSecret, audience, and optional scope array. Response
    includes accessToken string and expiresIn integer; use the accessToken in subsequent
    API requests (typically in Authorization header as Bearer token).

  - SCALAR API uses bearer token HTTP authentication. To obtain a token, POST to https://auth.api.eu1.scalar.zf.com/v1/integrators/token
    with a JSON request body containing clientId (integrator ID), clientSecret (integrator
    secret), and audience. Include the returned token in the Authorization header
    as a bearer token for subsequent API calls.
  - To obtain an access token, send a POST request with clientId, clientSecret, and
    audience as JSON body parameters. The response includes accessToken, expiresIn,
    and tokenType. Access tokens expire after 1 hour and must be refreshed by calling
    the token endpoint again. Include the access token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" for API requests. Audience determines which permissions
    are included in the token and must match the product being accessed.
