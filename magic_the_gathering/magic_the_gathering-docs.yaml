pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.magicthegathering.io:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number, optional) and pageSize (results
    per page, optional) in the request URL. The response contains a sets array with
    the paginated data.
  - Pagination uses the query parameter `page` to navigate results. Response headers
    include Link with rel="next" and rel="last" URLs, Page-Size (100 cards per page),
    Count (cards in current page), and Total-Count (31090 total cards). Continue paginating
    by following the Link header's rel="next" URL until no next link is provided.
  - 'The Magic: The Gathering API uses Link headers for pagination, including prev,
    last, next, and first links when results are paginated. Response headers include
    Page-Size, Count, Total-Count to indicate pagination state, and the Link header
    contains the URLs for navigating between pages.'
  - Use query parameters page and pageSize to paginate cards. page specifies the page
    number (default 1) and pageSize specifies results per page (default 100). Chain
    where clauses or pass as query parameters to retrieve specific pages.

    header with rel="next" and rel="last" for navigation, Page-Size header (100 cards
    max per request), Total-Count header for total results, and Count header for current
    page results. Stop pagination when rel="next" is absent from Link header.
