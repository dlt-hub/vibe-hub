notes:
- The `sessionToken` expires after around an hour.
- API keys are required to access the APIs
- The API rate limit is set on a per Partner basis.
- Prices are provided by booking agent/online travel agent partners and are subject
  to change without notice.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- This feature is only accessible by selected partners on an approval basis.
- Make sure additional attributes feature is enabled for you by speaking to your Account
  Manager.
- This feature is not available in all markets.
- If a request fails due to missing or invalid params, the endpoint returns a 307
  response with skyscanner.net as the destination URL.
- This feature is not enabled by default.
- You should have been setup on Impact when onboarding to the Skyscanner Affiliate
  Program, and your Impact Ids will have been linked to your API key by us.
- Do not include PII data (like customer emails) in your tracking parameters.
- Highly recommend informing your traveller about the lack of protection/cover if
  something goes wrong.
- Highlight to the user there is a self transfer and provide clear information about
  what they need to do.
- The user is required to make more than 1 booking and will receive more than 1 booking
  reference
- Mash-ups DO NOT involve an airline alliance. So if something goes wrong with a mash-up,
  it could cost a user more money
- Multi-City is only supported for flights live prices.
- nearbyAirports filter has to be set to false as it's not supported for multi-search.
- Maximum 6 places are supported meaning you can have maximum 6 queryLegs.
- Skyscanner is not responsible for any incorrect implementation of the API and its
  features.
- 'You will need to provide queries with localisation parameters: market, locale,
  and currency.'
- We use rate limiting to protect our service's from strain on web servers, malicious
  attacks and caps on API calls per app.
- If you are getting rate limits contact your account manager as they can upgrade
  your rate limits or suggest a solution to why you are getting rate limited.
- Emissions data is accessible through an opt-in parameter `includeSustainabilityData`.
- Impact is a third party tool we use for tracking our partner's redirects so that
  we can calculate payments to partners.
