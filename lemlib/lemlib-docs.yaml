notes:
- 'Caution: kI should only be used as a last resort, when kP and kD can’t be tuned
  to a satisfactory degree, which is rare.'
- This motion tends to be a bit slower than the moveToPoint, so you should prefer
  moveToPoint where you do not need the extra accuracy.
- The position of the robot when it starts following the path is critical.
- Motion chaining is useful for defining paths without pure pursuit or whenever you
  prefer speed over accuracy.
- A minSpeed of 72 means that the chassis will slow down as it approaches the target
  point, but it won't come to a full stop.
- create a new exponential drive curve
- controller deadband is set to 5
- minimum output is set to 12
- curve gain is set to 1.132
