notes:
- Self-hosted ThingPark Enterprise is future-proof to be integrated with any cloud
  provider.
- Contact the Actility support to deploy ThingPark Enterprise on cloud environments
  not explicitly listed.
- 'LRR 2.8.x requires authorizing new TLS flows between the base station and ThingPark''s
  public key infrastructure: i7a for SaaS deployments or i38, i39 and i40 for self-hosted
  deployments.'
- ThingPark Enterprise may run in a geo-redundant, fully managed 24*7 SaaS platform
  hosted in one of Actility's regional datacenters.
- Secure authentication, through multi-factor authentication and brute-force mitigation
  mechanisms
- Integration with External Authentication providers (using oAuth2 and OpenID-Connect)
- Authentication relies on OAuth v2. All requests should include a valid Bearer token
  in the Authorization HTTP header.
- A valid OAuth v2 Bearer token is required.
- Only JSON is supported
- You can access the service account's information from the Service Account list.
- You can change any service account's information except the client ID's prefix and
  the client secret.
- Authorization required with Bearer token
