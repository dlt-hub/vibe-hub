In this guide, we'll set up a complete Box data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def box_content_management_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.box.com/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "files/content",
            "ai/ask",
            "ai/extract"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='box_content_management_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='box_content_management_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(box_content_management_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from box_content_management‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- File Text Extraction: Allows extraction of text from files stored in Box.
- AI Ask: Provides a method to ask questions or make requests using AI capabilities.
- AI Extract: Used for extracting information using AI from content within Box.
- AI Extract Structured: Similar to AI Extract but focuses on structured data extraction.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Box workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@box_content_management-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Box support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:box_content_management duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Box API, as specified in @box_content_management-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "files/content" and "ai/ask" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in box_content_management_pipeline.py and name the pipeline box_content_management_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python box_content_management_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Box uses OAuth2 for authentication. The flow is client credentials, requiring a client ID and client secret to obtain an access token. The token is passed in the header for subsequent API requests.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.box.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python box_content_management_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline box_content_management load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset box_content_management_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/box_content_management.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline box_content_management_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("box_content_management_pipeline").dataset()
   # get files/content table as Pandas frame
   data.files/content.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Box API only supports full refresh sync, not incremental sync. It requires configuration of client credential grants in the Box application. Common errors include 401 Unauthorized, indicating issues with client ID or client secret, and 404 Not Found, which typically means incorrect Folder ID or File ID.
