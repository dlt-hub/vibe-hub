pagination_info:
- information_source; https://mediumapi.com/documentation.html:
  - 'The API uses cursor-based pagination with optional query parameters: `count`
    (optional, limits results to max 25 per request) and `after` (optional, accepts
    a user_id cursor to retrieve followers after that point). The response includes
    a `next` attribute containing the cursor value to use in the `after` parameter
    for the subsequent request.'
  - The endpoint returns the latest 25 articles and accepts an optional `from` query
    parameter (a date-time string) to retrieve articles posted before that timestamp,
    enabling cursor-based pagination by repeatedly using the oldest article's timestamp
    as the next `from` value.
  - The response includes a "next" field containing a timestamp value ("1655196790606")
    that appears to be used for cursor-based pagination to retrieve subsequent articles.
    The "count" field indicates the number of articles returned, and "total_pinned_articles"
    specifies pinned articles at the beginning of the results.
  - Use optional query parameter `next` to paginate results. Set `next` to an empty
    string for the first page or omit it for default first page. Pass the `next` value
    from the previous response to retrieve subsequent pages.
