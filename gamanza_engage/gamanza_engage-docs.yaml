auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gamanzaengage.com/docs-api/intro/index.html:
  - The Platform API Gateway requires OAuth 2 Client Credentials Grant authentication,
    which must be created via the admin dashboard. The Frontend API Gateway requires
    player identity token validation through an operator-implemented API endpoint.
    Specific header names, parameter details, and token acquisition mechanics are
    not provided in this excerpt.

  : - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required using the client credentials flow. Obtain
      an access token from the token URL at https://platform.gamanzaengage.com/oauth/token
      (or similar OAuth2 endpoint as specified in platform authorization documentation),
      then include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for all
      API requests to the Risk Rest API.

  - OAuth 2.0 using the client_credentials grant type is required for platform integrations.
    Applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf
    of a user. The Client Credentials flow should be used to obtain the access token,
    which is then sent in subsequent API requests.
  - Player authentication uses JWT identity tokens sent to the PEP Frontend API Gateway.
    Call POST `{gamanza_engage_fe_api_url}/api/auth/v1/player` with identityToken
    (player's sessionID or accessToken) and clientId (your API client ID) in the request
    body. The gateway validates the token by calling your Operators API endpoint POST
    `{operators_api_url}/api/auth/v1/player` with the identityToken parameter, which
    must return playerId and optional expiresAt (RFC 3339 format) on success (HTTP
    200).
