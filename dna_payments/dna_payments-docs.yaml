auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.dnapayments.com/docs/partner-tools/reporting/reporting-api/auth:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used for authentication. Send a POST request
    to https://test-oauth.dnapayments.com/oauth2/token with grant_type set to client_credentials,
    scope set to partners_reporting, and provide client_id and client_secret in the
    request body. The response includes an access_token (Bearer token type) with an
    expires_in value in seconds, which should be used in subsequent API requests.
  - This API uses OAuth2 with the client_credentials grant type. To authenticate,
    POST to https://test-oauth.dnapayments.com/oauth2/token with form data containing
    client_id, client_secret, grant_type set to 'client_credentials', and scope 'partners_reporting'.
    The response includes an access_token with token_type 'Bearer' that should be
    used in subsequent API requests as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
- information_source; https://developer.dnapayments.com/docs/partner-tools/reporting/reporting-api/merchants:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" where the token value is provided (example: 6945595921271780).
    This applies to all requests shown in both V1 and V2 API endpoints.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.dnapayments.com/docs/partner-tools/reporting/reporting-api/merchants:
  - The V2 API uses query parameter page (starting at 1) to paginate merchant results.
    The response contains a data array with merchant objects, but the documentation
    does not specify response fields indicating pagination state (such as total pages,
    has_more, or next_page), so the full pagination behavior is unclear.
- information_source; https://developer.dnapayments.com/docs/partner-tools/reporting/settlement-api/settlements:
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (page number, starting at 1) and
    size (number of records per page, example shows 100). The response includes totalCount
    field indicating total records available. Continue requesting with incremented
    page values until the returned record count is less than the requested size or
    all totalCount records have been retrieved.
  - The response includes a totalCount field indicating total records available. The
    number of data objects returned is limited by page and size request parameters.
    Pagination is controlled via page and size fields in the request parameters (see
    Request Parameters section for details on these fields).
