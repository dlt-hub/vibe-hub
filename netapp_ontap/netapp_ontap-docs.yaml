auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/resources/security.html:
  - OAuth 2.0 is a token-based framework used to restrict access to ONTAP storage
    resources via REST API. Introduced in ONTAP 9.14, it supports Microsoft Entra
    ID authorization server with standard OAuth 2.0 claims, group claims based on
    UUID values, and external role mapping for group and role mappings.
- information_source; https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/whats-new.html:
  - OAuth 2.0 support is available for Microsoft Entra ID authorization server with
    standard OAuth 2.0 claims. Web authentication (WebAuthn) based on public key cryptography
    is supported for phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication through System
    Manager and the ONTAP REST API. New API endpoints include group UUID to group
    name mapping at /security/groups, UUID group to role mapping at /security/group/role-mapping,
    and external role management capabilities for mapping external OAuth 2.0 identity
    provider roles to ONTAP roles.
  - Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0) is a token-based framework that can be used to
    restrict access to ONTAP storage resources through the REST API. Configuration
    can be performed with any ONTAP administrative interface including the REST API.
    Additionally, Cisco Duo provides two-factor authentication for SSH logins and
    can be configured at the ONTAP cluster or SVM level.

  : - OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication is supported as an alternative to certificate-based
      auth for ONTAP REST API (available from ONTAP 9.14.1+). OAuth 2.0 tokens replace
      passwords for user account authentication, and authorization decisions are applied
      when clients access ONTAP via the REST API.
    - ONTAP OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication is used for REST API access. Clients
      must obtain an access token through the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow and include
      it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token with each API request. The
      token is obtained by authenticating with ONTAP credentials and specifying required
      scopes to define what resources and operations the token can access.

- information_source; https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-restapi-96/getting_started_with_the_ontap_rest_api.html:
  - GET requests returning arrays use limit and offset query parameters for pagination.
    The response includes num_records for the count of returned records and a _links
    object with a next href link to retrieve the next page of records; pagination
    continues until the next link is absent.
