auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.arvancloud.ir/en/developer-tools/api/api-usage:
  - API key authentication using the Authorization header with the value MU-KEY, plus
    AWS Signature Version 2 HMAC-SHA1 signing for Object Storage requests using S3KEY
    and S3SECRET credentials passed in the Authorization header as "AWS {S3KEY}:{signature}".
  - AWS Signature Version 2 HMAC-SHA1 authentication is used. Credentials consist
    of an access key (S3KEY) and secret key (S3SECRET). The signature is computed
    by HMAC-SHA1 signing a canonical string (method, content-type, content-md5, date,
    and resource path) with the secret key, base64-encoded, then sent in the Authorization
    header as "AWS {access_key}:{signature}". The Date header must be included in
    the canonical string and request headers.
  - AWS Signature Version 2 authentication is required. Include the Access Key and
    Secret Key to generate an HMAC-SHA1 signature. Send credentials via the Authorization
    header as "AWS {AccessKey}:{signature}", along with a Date header in RFC 2822
    format. The signature is computed from a canonical string containing the HTTP
    method, content type, date, and resource path, signed with the Secret Key using
    HMAC-SHA1 and base64-encoded.
