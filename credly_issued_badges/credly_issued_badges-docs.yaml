auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/web_service_api:
  - Authentication can be done using Authorization Tokens or OAuth 2.0. The documentation
    references separate pages for each mechanism but does not provide the specific
    implementation details, header names, parameter names, or credential formats in
    this section.
  - 'Authentication is handled via HTTP Basic Authentication or OAuth 2.0. For HTTP
    Basic Authentication, send credentials in the Authorization header using the standard
    format. For OAuth 2.0, use bearer tokens in the Authorization header. All requests
    must use SSL and include Content-Type: application/json.'
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/authorization_tokens:
  - 'Authorization tokens are required to access this API. Tokens are passed in the
    Authorization header as bearer tokens and can be created via POST /organizations/<organization_id>/authorization_tokens
    using an existing token with write permissions. New tokens have a 180-day default
    expiration and support granular permissions: read_enabled, write_enabled, and
    delete_enabled. A token cannot be granted more permissions than the token used
    to create it.'
  - Authorization tokens are used for API authentication and are passed in requests
    to access the Credly API. Tokens expire after 180 days by default and can be rotated
    via POST request to generate a new token, which immediately invalidates the previous
    one. The token response includes a token field containing the authorization credential,
    along with metadata about permissions (write_enabled, read_enabled, delete_enabled),
    expiration time (expires_at), and owner information. To rotate a token, POST to
    /organizations/<organization_id>/authorization_tokens/rotate with an optional
    description parameter in the JSON body.
  - Authorization tokens are used to access the Credly platform and can be created
    via API or UI. Tokens are passed as credentials and support read, write, and delete
    permissions. Retrieve tokens via GET /organizations/<organization_id>/authorization_tokens,
    which returns token strings (e.g., "RnsDbkhD31hw7u2WnNymVEDgn3k123443H1w3") with
    associated metadata including permission flags (write_enabled, read_enabled, delete_enabled)
    and expiration times. Use the token value in subsequent API requests for authentication.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/issued_badges:
  - Pagination uses a forward cursor mechanism. The response includes a `next_page_url`
    field that contains the full URL for the next page of results. Continue requesting
    the URL in `next_page_url` until it becomes null, indicating no more data. Results
    are sorted by `created_at` and then by `id` for ties. The `sort` parameter is
    not supported on this endpoint.
  - Use the `page` query parameter to specify the page number of badges to retrieve.
    The documentation does not specify response fields indicating total pages, next
    page, or when to stop paginating, so the exact stopping condition is unclear.
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/authorization_tokens:
  - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, here is the pagination information:


    Paginated responses use metadata fields including count, current_page, total_count,
    total_pages, and per (items per page). Navigation uses previous_page_url and next_page_url
    fields; when these are null, there are no additional pages. The per parameter
    defaults to 50 items per page.'
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/oauth:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (optional, defaults to 1) and per_page (optional,
    defaults to 50). Response metadata includes current_page, total_pages, total_count,
    count, per, next_page_url, and previous_page_url to navigate pages; stop when
    next_page_url is null.
- information_source; https://api.youracclaim.com/docs/badge_templates:
  - Pagination is implemented using query parameters page and per_page (optional,
    defaults to 50). The response metadata includes count, current_page, total_count,
    total_pages, per, previous_page_url, and next_page_url. Continue paginating while
    next_page_url is not null; stop when it becomes null or current_page equals total_pages.
