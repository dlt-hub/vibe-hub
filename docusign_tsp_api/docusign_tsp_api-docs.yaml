- information_source; https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/:
  - 'Docusign uses OAuth 2.0 to secure API requests. Four grant types are supported:
    Confidential Authorization Code Grant, Public Authorization Code Grant, Implicit
    Grant, and one additional type (documentation cut off). Apps request access and
    perform actions on behalf of users by obtaining OAuth tokens.'
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required with multiple grant type options: Authorization
    Code Grant, Implicit Grant, and JWT Grant. The specific OAuth flow and token endpoint
    depend on your chosen grant type and application configuration.'
- information_source; https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth/:
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required. Obtain an access token using one of four supported
    flows: Confidential Authorization Code Grant, Public Authorization Code Grant,
    JSON Web Token Grant, or Implicit Grant. Include the access token with each API
    request. The signature scope must be requested when obtaining the token.'
- information_source; https://developers.docusign.com/docs/tsp-api/reference/sign-hash-session-information/:
  - The TSP Sign Hash Session Information endpoint requires an Authentication header
    parameter (type String) to be included in requests. The exact authentication scheme
    and credential format are referenced in the Authentication documentation but not
    detailed in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://developers.docusign.com/docs/tsp-api/tsp101/tsp-authentication/:
  - OAuth 2.0 Basic authentication is used. The Authorization header must contain
    the client ID and client secret concatenated with a semicolon, base64-encoded
    per RFC 6749 Section 2.3.1. Alternatively, pass client_id and client_secret as
    POST parameters. The response provides an access_token with token_type "Bearer"
    that must be used in all subsequent API requests.
