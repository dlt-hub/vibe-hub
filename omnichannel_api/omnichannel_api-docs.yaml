- information_source; https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10204500/SztHX5Qb:
  - Creatio API supports OAuth 2.0 for authorization of external requests. To use
    OAuth 2.0, obtain an OAuth token from the Identity Service and include it in requests
    to retrieve Creatio data via OData 4 and DataService web services. The Identity
    Service endpoint is located at https://myidentityservice.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    for retrieving OAuth configuration details.
  - The API uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and authorization. Clients
    must obtain an access token from the token_endpoint at https://myidentityservice.com/connect/token
    (using client credentials or authorization code flow), then include it in requests.
    The issuer is creatio.com, and supported scopes include openid, profile, and email.
    Token validation can be performed using the JWKS URI at https://myidentityservice.com/.well-known/openid\-configuration/jwks.
    User information is available from the userinfo_endpoint, and tokens can be revoked
    via the revocation_endpoint.
  - 'This documentation describes OAuth2 configuration and health check endpoints.
    The auth mechanisms supported include: authorization code flow with multiple response
    types (code, token, id_token combinations), token endpoint authentication via
    client_secret_basic or client_secret_post methods, ID token signing with RS256
    algorithm, and PKCE with plain or S256 code challenge methods. Clients authenticate
    at the token endpoint using either HTTP Basic authentication with client credentials
    or by sending client_secret and client_id in the POST body.'

  - API Key authentication is required. Send the ABRP user token as a query parameter
    named token or within the JSON body data array as a token field for each vehicle
    entry.
  - API Key authentication is required. Send the API key as a query parameter named
    `api_key` in requests to the Iternio Telemetry API endpoints. The exact method
    of passing the key should match the collection's auth configuration referenced
    in the documentation.
