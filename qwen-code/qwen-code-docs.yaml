notes:
- 'Free Tier: Up to 60 requests/min and 2,000 requests/day with your QwenChat account.'
- 'Advanced Model: Specially optimized for Qwen3-Coder for superior code understanding
  and assistance.'
- Vision model auto-switching is enabled by default.
- Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.
- Uses OAuth2 with automatic credential management
- Free tier includes 2,000 requests per day
- Free 2000 daily requests via QwenChat OAuth
- Qwen Code can be run in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripting and
  automation.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Seamless access to Qwen models with automatic credential refresh.
- A specific quota for different models is not specified; model fallback may occur
  to preserve shared experience quality.
- API keys are stored in memory during the session
- For persistent storage, use environment variables or .env files
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Uses TOML format for command definitions
- When you run `/git:commit`, the CLI first executes `git diff --staged`, then replaces
  `!{git diff --staged}` with the output of that command before sending the final,
  complete prompt to the model.
- File content injection with `@{...}` is processed *before* shell commands (`!{...}`)
  and argument substitution (`{{args}}`)
- Sandboxing is disabled by default, but can be enabled using --sandbox or -s flag.
- By default, it uses a pre-built qwen-code-sandbox Docker image.
- String values within your settings.json files can reference environment variables
  using either $VAR_NAME or ${VAR_NAME} syntax.
- Environment variables are used for configuration, especially for sensitive information
  like API keys.
- Selected themes are saved in Qwen Code’s configuration so your preference is remembered
  across sessions.
- If a theme is defined in your settings.json file, you must remove the 'theme' setting
  from the file before you can change the theme using the /theme command.
- The Trusted Folders feature is disabled by default.
- Qwen Code includes the ability to automatically ignore files, similar to .gitignore.
- Handles communication with model APIs, managing tools, and processing requests.
- The Memory Import Processor allows you to modularize your context files by importing
  content from other files.
- Supports both relative and absolute paths
- Automatically detects circular imports
- Qwen Code includes built-in tools that the model uses to interact with your local
  environment, access information, and perform actions.
- 'Binary file handling: Image/PDF/Audio/Video files must be explicitly targeted by
  the paths or include patterns.'
- The is_background parameter is required for all command executions.
- The tool stores todo lists in your home directory (`~/.qwen/todos/`) with session-specific
  files, so each coding session maintains its own task list.
- 'Single URL processing: web_fetch processes one URL at a time.'
- 'URL format: The tool automatically upgrades HTTP URLs to HTTPS and converts GitHub
  blob URLs to raw format for better content access.'
- 'Content processing: The tool fetches content directly and processes it using an
  AI model, converting HTML to readable text format.'
- 'Output quality: The quality of the output will depend on the clarity of the instructions
  in the prompt.'
- If the key is not configured, the tool will be disabled and skipped.
- This tool should be used for concise, important facts. It is not intended for storing
  large amounts of data or conversational history.
- The memory file is a plain text Markdown file, so you can view and edit it manually
  if needed.
- OAuth authentication requires that your local machine can open a web browser for
  authentication
- 'Browser redirect requirements: Receive redirects on http://localhost:7777/oauth/callback'
- OAuth authentication requires that your local machine can open a web browser for
  authentication.
- 'Trust settings: The trust option bypasses all confirmation dialogs. Use cautiously
  and only for servers you completely control'
- 'Access tokens: Be security-aware when configuring environment variables containing
  API keys or tokens'
- This feature will not work in headless environments without browser access
- Last updated on October 23, 2025
- Subagents are independent AI assistants that specialize in specific tasks.
- Subagents maintain their own conversation history and can work autonomously.
- Subagents only have access to their configured tools
- All tool execution follows the same security model as direct tool use
- All subagent actions are logged and visible in real-time
- Project and user-level separation provides appropriate boundaries
- Avoid including secrets or credentials in agent configurations
- Consider separate agents for production vs development environments
- The Checkpointing feature is disabled by default. To enable it, use a command-line
  flag or edit your settings.json file.
- Sandboxing isolates potentially dangerous operations from your host system, providing
  a security barrier.
- Sandboxing reduces but doesn’t eliminate all risks.
- Headless mode allows you to run Qwen Code programmatically from command line scripts
  and automation tools without any interactive UI.
- Welcome Back feature helps you seamlessly resume your work by automatically detecting
  when you return to a project with existing conversation history.
- 'Token caching is available for: API key users (Qwen API key), Vertex AI users (with
  project and location setup)'
- 'Token caching is not available for: OAuth users (Google Personal/Enterprise accounts)
  - the Code Assist API does not support cached content creation at this time'
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The plugin MUST create a discovery file in os.tmpdir()/qwen/ide/
- 'The discovery file MUST follow the naming convention: qwen-code-ide-server-${PID}-${PORT}.json'
- Releases are managed through the release.yml GitHub Actions workflow.
- Automated nightly release process to provide the latest version for testing and
  development.
- This project uses NPM Workspaces to manage the packages within this monorepo.
- 'Simplified Dependency Management: Running npm install from the root of the project
  will install all dependencies for all packages in the workspace and link them together.'
- 'Automatic Linking: Packages within the workspace can depend on each other.'
- 'Simplified Script Execution: You can run scripts in any package from the root of
  the project using the --workspace flag.'
- For security and isolation, Qwen Code can be run inside a container.
- Qwen Code can be run inside a container for security and isolation.
- Enable telemetry in your .qwen/settings.json
- You may be on a corporate network with a firewall that intercepts and inspects SSL/TLS
  traffic. This often requires a custom root CA certificate to be trusted by Node.js.
- Set the NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable to the absolute path of your corporate
  root CA certificate file.
- When using OpenAI-compatible API authentication, you are subject to the terms and
  privacy policies of your chosen API provider.
- Only allows HTTPS connections to example.com:443
- Deny all requests other than CONNECT for HTTPS
- Extensions are designed to be easily installable and shareable.
- All commands will only be reflected in active CLI sessions on restart.
- GitHub releases can be more efficient on initial install as they are shipped as
  single archives instead of requiring a git clone which downloads each file individually.
- You are an expert developer assistant. When the user asks you to fetch posts, use
  the `fetch_posts` tool. Be concise in your responses.
- 'Quota: 60 requests per minute'
- 'Quota: 2,000 requests per day'
- Token usage is not applicable
- 'Cost: Free'
- Some environment variables (like DEBUG and DEBUG_MODE) are automatically excluded
  from project .env files to prevent interference with qwen-code behavior.
- Commands are stored in user and project directories with precedence.
- You can directly embed the content of a file or a directory listing into your prompt
  using the `@{...}` syntax.
- File content injection with `@{...}` is processed *before* shell commands (`!{...}`)
  and argument substitution (`{{args}}`).
- Uses JSON settings files for persistent configuration.
- Configuration is applied in a specific order of precedence.
- Using a broadly scoped personal access token that has access to personal and private
  repositories can lead to information from the private repository being leaked into
  the public repository.
