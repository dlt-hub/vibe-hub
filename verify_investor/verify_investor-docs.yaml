auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.verifyinvestor.com:
  - API Token authentication is required for all endpoint requests. The API Token
    is private and must be used to authenticate requests to API endpoints. Additionally,
    a User Authorization Token (public) is needed to generate links for new users
    signing up or for existing users granting application access to their data. Set
    the Content-Type header to application/json for all requests. API account details
    and tokens are available at https://www.verifyinvestor.com/settings after being
    granted API access.
  - 'API token authentication via Authorization header. Include the header Authorization:
    Token YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE when making requests to webhook endpoints and other
    API operations. The token is required to authenticate requests to VerifyInvestor.com
    API. Additionally, webhook authenticity is verified by computing an SHA-256 HMAC
    of the request body using the webhook secret and comparing it to the X-Signature-SHA256
    header value.'
  - 'Authentication uses a token-based scheme sent in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE" where YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
    is replaced with your actual API token. API tokens are different for staging (https://verifyinvestor-staging.herokuapp.com)
    and production (https://www.verifyinvestor.com) environments; contact accounts@verifyinvestor.com
    for staging credentials or support@verifyinvestor.com for production access. Also
    include "Content-Type: application/json" and "Accept: application/json" headers
    with requests.'
  - 'Authentication uses a token-based scheme. Include the API token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE" for all requests to the API
    endpoints.'
  - 'Authentication uses an API token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE" with each request, replacing
    YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE with your actual API token.'
