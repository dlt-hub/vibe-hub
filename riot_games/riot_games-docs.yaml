- information_source; https://support-developer.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/22897607341075-OAuth-Client-Documentation:
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 bearer tokens. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {accessToken}". When directing users to login, include the cpid
    (current platform id) scope to ensure the OAuth access token is generated with
    that scope, which enables the cpid field to be returned from userinfo requests
    at https://auth.riotgames.com/userinfo.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Direct players to https://auth.riotgames.com/authorize
    with client_id, redirect_uri, response_type=code, and scope=openid+offline_access.
    Exchange the authorization code for an access token, then use the access token
    in the Authorization header as Bearer token when calling account endpoints (e.g.,
    GET https://americas.api.riotgames.com/riot/account/v1/accounts/me with header
    Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}).'
  - OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required. Direct users to login with the
    cpid scope to obtain an access token. Include the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {accessToken}" when making requests to the account endpoint at https://americas.api.riotgames.com/riot/account/v1/accounts/me
    (or europe/asia regional variants). The cpid scope ensures the cpid field is returned
    from https://auth.riotgames.com/userinfo, which identifies the user's current
    platform for routing subsequent requests to the appropriate regional DNS.
