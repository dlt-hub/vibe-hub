notes:
- By default, grackle will not print anything but error messages. However, a short
  summary of the running configuration can be printed by setting grackle_verbose to
  1. In a parallel code, it is recommended that output only be enabled for the root
  process.
- The electron mass density should be scaled by the ratio of the proton mass to the
  electron mass.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The cooling rates in the files below are known to have unphysically high heating
  rates at low densities.
- It is not recommended to use these files with primordial_chemistry set to 0.
- We are strongly committed to maintaining backwards compatibility with the public
  API.
- At the time of writing, the current design of Grackle’s API is not conducive to
  supporting a stable ABI.
- Pygrackle can only be run when Grackle is compiled without OpenMP.
- The community of participants in open source scientific projects is made up of members
  from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
- This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including
  mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events,
  and one-to-one interactions.
- Grackle is a community project.
- Grackle is under the Enzo public license, a BSD-like license.
- This page employs some strong language to express the developers’ intentions about
  what are officially supported ways for Grackle to be used.
- Be advised that things may break if you use Grackle in an unsupported manner.
- Uses CMake build system — requires version 3.16 or newer.
- Classic build system is deprecated since version 3.4 and scheduled for removal in
  version 3.5.
- Uses libtool for building and installation.
- Compiling Grackle in single precision is not recommended.
- Gracklepy was formerly known as Pygrackle.
- The vast majority of Grackle calculation requires Grackle’s data files.
- Grackle currently supports two APIs.
- The Local API is explicitly thread-safe as it involves no global data.
- As of version 2.2, Grackle can be run with OpenMP parallelism.
- When compiling Grackle with the classic build system, execute `make omp-on` before
  compiling.
- When using the CMake build system, set the `GRACKLE_USE_OPENMP` cmake-variable to
  `ON`.
- A potential workaround for most of the above difficulties when you have a shared
  library and static library installed is that we create a new file called grackle_static.pc
  that gets shipped alongside grackle.pc.
- This workaround is undesirable (unless there is strong user-demand) for a number
  of reasons.
