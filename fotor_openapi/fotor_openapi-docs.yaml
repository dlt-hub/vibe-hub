auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.fotor.com/getting-started/auth:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include your API key obtained from the
    Fotor Developer Platform in the Authorization header as "Bearer <your_api_key>".
    The Content-Type header must also be set to "application/json". Missing or invalid
    Authorization tokens result in 401 Unauthorized errors.
  - 'Fotor OpenAPI uses Bearer Token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" with every request.'
  - To access Fotor OpenAPI, include a valid API key in the Authorization header and
    set Content-Type to application/json. The API key must be provided in the Authorization
    header for all requests.
- information_source; https://docs.fotor.com/reference/get-task:
  - API key authentication is required. Include your API key in requests to access
    the task details endpoint. Keep the API key secure and do not disclose it to prevent
    unauthorized access.
- information_source; https://docs.fotor.com/sdk/start:
  - The Fotor AI Editor SDK uses API Key-based authentication with a server-side temporary
    token flow. Store the API Key on your server, exchange it for a temporary token
    via the Get Sdk Temporary Token endpoint, and provide that temporary token to
    frontend clients instead of exposing the API Key directly.
