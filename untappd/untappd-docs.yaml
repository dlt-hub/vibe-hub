auth_info:
- information_source; https://untappd.com/api/docs:
  - Authentication can be provided via access_token for authorized calls, or client_id
    and client_secret for unauthorized calls, passed as query parameters. When access_token
    is provided, the USERNAME parameter can be omitted to return results for the authenticated
    user.
  - Authentication is optional. You can pass either access_token for authorized calls,
    or client_id and client_secret for unauthorized calls, as query parameters. When
    using authentication with access_token, the USERNAME parameter can be omitted
    to return the authenticated user's results.
  - Authentication is required and uses an access token passed as a query parameter.
    Include access_token as a required string parameter in the request to the /v4/friend/request/TARGET_ID

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://untappd.com/api/docs:
  - Pagination uses optional limit parameter (max 50, default 25) and max_id parameter
    to specify the checkin ID to start results from. The response includes a count
    field indicating number of returned records; use the lowest checkin_id from current
    results as max_id in the next request to fetch older checkins.
  - The API returns a list of 25 user wish-listed beers by default. Pagination uses
    `offset` (int, optional) to specify the starting position and `limit` (int, optional,
    max 50, default 25) to control results per request. The response includes a `count`
    field indicating total results, and you construct the next request by incrementing
    `offset` by the `limit` value until fewer than `limit` results are returned.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with `max_id` and `min_id` parameters to
    control result range. The `limit` parameter specifies the number of results returned
    (optional, max 25, default 25). The response includes a `count` field indicating
    returned items; use the lowest `checkin_id` from results as the next `max_id`
    to fetch older checkins.
  - The User Friends endpoint uses offset-based pagination with optional offset (int)
    and limit (int, default 25, max 25) query parameters to control which results
    are returned. The response includes a count field indicating the number of items
    in the current result set.
  - Use `min_id` (optional, int) to specify the checkin ID to start results after,
    and `limit` (optional, int, max 25, default 25) to control results per request.
    The response includes `count` field indicating returned items; paginate by using
    the lowest checkin ID from current results as the next `min_id` parameter.
