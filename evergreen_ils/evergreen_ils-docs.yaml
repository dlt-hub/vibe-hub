- information_source; https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/docs/latest/integrations/restful_api.html:
  - Evergreen ILS RESTful API requires an authentication token passed as eg_auth_token
    parameter to OpenSRF methods. The token must be included in method parameters
    when calling endpoints like user retrieval functions, and serves as the authorization
    credential for accessing patron and other protected resources.
  - Obtaining an Evergreen auth token requires sending an HTTP GET request to the
    /self/auth path with credentials passed either as a standard HTTP Basic authorization
    header (with optional third component for login type) or through query parameters
    (specific parameter names are in the API specification document).
  - The API requires an authentication token passed as the `eg_auth_token` parameter.
    The token must be provided to access the endpoint, and the username is supplied
    as a path parameter.
  - 'The API supports three security methods for authentication and authorization:
    Basic Authentication and Parameter Security for the specialized authentication
    endpoint, while all other endpoints default to Bearer Authentication (though Bearer,
    Cookie, and Parameter authentication are generally usable for most endpoints).
    Rate limits are applied based on endpoint type and user context: authentication
    endpoints use 100 requests per second by default, while other endpoints use 1
    request per second per known user, 1 request per second per IP address if user
    is unknown, or 1 request per second globally if neither is available.'
  - The API uses a two-step authentication process. First, obtain an Evergreen auth
    token by sending credentials via HTTP Basic auth header (with optional login type
    component) or query parameters u, p, and t, requesting the response as plain text
    or JSON via the Accept header. Then, use the returned token in subsequent requests
    via HTTP Bearer authentication header, or alternatively pass it as a query parameter
    ses, or in cookies eg.auth.token, ses, or eg.api.token.
