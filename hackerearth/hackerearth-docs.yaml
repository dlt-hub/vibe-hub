auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/api/recruiter/v2/tests/reset-test/:
  - Client authentication uses client_id and client_secret credentials. The client_id
    is a 67-character string passed as a parameter to the API endpoint. Both client_id
    and client_secret can be obtained from the Dashboard settings under API details
    section.
- information_source; https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/sql-evaluation-v1/:
  - Authentication is done using a client-secret API key generated during registration.
    Pass the client-secret value in the request header with the key name "client-secret".
    Additionally, the "content-type" header must be set to "application/json". Both
    headers are mandatory for all requests.
  - Authentication uses a client secret passed as a custom HTTP header. Include the
    header "client-secret" with your secret value in all requests to the SQL evaluation
    API endpoints.
  - Pass the client secret in the header using the key client-secret for authentication.
    This header is required for both POST requests to submit SQL evaluations and GET
    requests to fetch evaluation status.
  - The API requires a client secret passed as the `client-secret` header in HTTP
    requests. Include the header with your secret key value to authenticate requests
    to the SQL evaluation endpoints.
