  - To use the NeoLoad Web API, all requests must be made over HTTPS and authenticated
    using an access token. If a request is not authenticated by an access token, it
    fails. The access token must be included with each request, though the specific
    header name and token acquisition method are not detailed in this excerpt.

  : - 'Authorization header "Authorization: Bearer <your Execution API access token>"
      is required for POST requests to the Execution API. The X-Tricentis header with
      value "OK" must also be included in requests as a CSRF protection measure.'
    - Requests to the Execution API require an access token in the header when using
      Tosca Server with HTTPS binding. You must first request an access token, then
      include it in the header of every subsequent request to the API.
    - 'Requests to the Execution API require two headers: a CSRF token in the X-Tricentis
      header set to ''OK'', and a Bearer token in the Authorization header containing
      your Execution API access token. The Bearer token is obtained separately and
      passed as ''Authorization: Bearer <your Execution API access token>''.'
    - 'The Execution API requires two headers for authentication and CSRF protection.
      Send a Bearer token in the Authorization header with your Execution API access
      token, and include the X-Tricentis header set to "OK" with every request.


      Header names and usage:

      - Authorization: Bearer <your Execution API access token>
