auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.candyhouse.co/:
  - API key authentication is required. Send your API key in the `Authorization` header
    (bearer token format) or as a query parameter. Missing or invalid API keys return
    a 401 Unauthorized error with message `UNAUTHORIZED`. Rate limiting is enforced
    per user account and IP address; exceeding limits returns 429 `THROTTLED` or 403
    `Forbidden` errors.
  - 'Authentication uses a bearer token scheme. Generate an API key from the CANDY
    HOUSE Dashboard (login, navigate to API Settings, verify identity, create new
    API key), then pass it in the Authorization header as "Authorization: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
    for every request.'
  - 'Authorization header with bearer token required. Send `Authorization: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
    in the request header to authenticate API calls.'
  - 'Authorization header with bearer token. Include the header "Authorization: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
    in all requests to the Sesame API endpoints.'
  - Authorization token must be included in the Header as a preset named "Sesame Token"
    for all API requests. The token is obtained from the CANDY HOUSE account and must
    be manually pasted into the preset configuration before use. The token is required
    for each subsequent API call to access only Sesames owned by the authenticated
    user account.
