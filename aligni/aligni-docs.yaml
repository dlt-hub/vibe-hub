auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.aligni.com/api/webhooks/:
  - Aligni includes two header values in each webhook request for authentication verification.
    The X-ALIGNI-SIGNATURE header contains a cryptographic signature computed over
    the timestamp and request body, used to validate the request source. The X-ALIGNI-TIMESTAMP
    header contains the request timestamp in ISO 8601 format. Clients must share the
    signature with Aligni and can reset it at any time, requiring updates to all receiving
    clients.
- information_source; https://docs.aligni.com/graphql-api/usage/:
  - 'Aligni uses personal API tokens for authentication. Pass the API token in the
    Authorization header with the format "Authorization: Token API_TOKEN". Each Aligni
    organization requires a different API token, which can be created in account settings
    under "API Tokens".'
  - Aligni's GraphQL API requires personal API tokens for authentication. Tokens should
    be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token to the endpoint https://ORGANIZATION.aligni.com/api/v3/graphql,
    where ORGANIZATION is your Aligni organization subdomain.
- information_source; https://docs.aligni.com/graphql-api/examples/:
  - Auth token passed in the Authorization header as "Token {auth_token}" where auth_token
    is a string value like "oid3vLgynoy_Yl1gZkrgkLEq3J". The token should be included
    in the Authorization header with the format "Token {value}" when making requests
    to the GraphQL endpoint.
  - Authentication uses a Token-based scheme sent via the Authorization header. The
    token is passed as "Token {auth_token}" in the Authorization header when making
    requests to the GraphQL endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.aligni.com/graphql-api/examples/:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based approach with `after` variable (optional, defaults
    to None) passed in GraphQL query variables. Response includes `pageInfo` object
    with `endCursor` and `hasNextPage` fields; continue paginating by passing `endCursor`
    as `after` value in next request until `hasNextPage` is false.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with `after` query parameter (String,
    optional) and response fields `pageInfo.endCursor` and `pageInfo.hasNext`. Pass
    `endCursor` as the `after` value in the next request; stop when `hasNext` is false.
