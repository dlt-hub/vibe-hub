pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.turnto.com/:
  - Pagination is supported using limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls the number of results returned per request, and offset specifies the
    starting position. The response includes a boolean moreQuestions property to indicate
    whether additional results are available; when moreQuestions is false, all results
    have been retrieved.
  - Pagination is supported using limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls the number of results returned per request, and the offset parameter
    specifies the starting position for results. Use the offset value to navigate
    through pages by incrementing it based on the limit value.
  - 'Pagination is supported using limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    specifies the number of results per page, and offset specifies the starting position
    for results (example: limit=10&offset=10 retrieves the second page of 10 results).'
  - Pagination is supported via limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    controls the number of results returned per request, and the offset parameter
    specifies the starting position for results. Use the offset value plus the limit
    value to construct the next request until all results are retrieved.
  - Pagination is supported via limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter
    specifies the number of results per page, and the offset parameter specifies the
    starting position (0-based) for results. Supply both parameters as query strings
    to navigate through paginated results.
