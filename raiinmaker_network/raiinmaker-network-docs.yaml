notes:
- Decentralized identity management to reduce liability and protect the identity of
  customers and employees.
- Privacy regulations can be honored with proof of compliance.
- Raiinmaker AI-Integrated Smart Contracts operate on a hybrid platform within the
  Enterprise Application Layer (EAL)
- Raiinmaker can support EVM (Ethereum) based smart contracts
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Raiinmaker
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Burning Raiin on the native Coiin Console will provide a one time boost to your
  Economic Score during the current Lunar cycle, and a permanent boost to your Validator
  Score.
- Raiinmaker is the ecosystem of verified human contribution to AI.
- Raiinmaker fosters human-AI collaboration via transparent, equitable, blockchain-secured
  mechanisms.
- The TRAIIN Platform is Raiinmaker's flagship data validation and AI training system.
- The TRAIIN Platform is designed to create ethically sourced, high-quality datasets
  for AI models.
- The Network Validation Layer (NVL) is the Raiinmaker Network’s mechanism for finalizing
  and securing transactions and user actions.
- 'Each of these pools are then distributed based on a variety of different metrics,
  such as the # of transactions they validated, amount of time they have had their
  validator up, # of Identity factors, how much Coiin they withdrew, deposited, and
  converted/burned.'
- To run your own Independent Validator, download the Raiinmaker Network Validator
  installer for your desktop or mobile OS from the Validator Nodes page.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 3rd Party validators are independent users who help to validate transactions and
  ensure decentralization.
- Each of the 3rd Party validators are given part of the Coiin pool every lunar cycle
  (~29 days).
- Raiinmaker Network EAL command line tool/shell (coiin) installation required.
- Raiinmaker Network EAL Platform makes use of Docker to deploy independently scalable
  smart contracts.
- Raiinmaker Network EAL business chains support indexing and searching transactions
  based on their transaction type.
- Uses Docker to deploy smart contracts in any programming language.
- Test locally and deploy frequently.
- Smart contracts can be invoked automatically on a scheduled time interval or based
  on a crontab configuration.
- Transaction payloads are not included in the block sent for network verification.
- Smart contracts take their command and arguments as parameters when being deployed.
- A smart contract can act as a 'self oracle' in a system wherein a business chain
  can pull its own data on any necessary schedule.
- Need help using Raiinmaker or Coiin.ai?
- Requires setup of decentralized identity management.
- Supports both EVM and non-EVM blockchains.
- Raiinmaker smart contracts are individually scalable using traditional devops best
  practices.
- Raiinmaker can support EVM (Ethereum) based smart contracts.
- Requires setup of connected app in Raiinmaker
- Ensure to comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations
- Raiinmaker supports RESTful API integration.
- Raiin burns will also affect a user’s ability to participate in governance of the
  Raiinmaker Network.
