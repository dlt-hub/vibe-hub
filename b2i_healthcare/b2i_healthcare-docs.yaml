auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.b2ihealthcare.com/snow-owl/rest-apis:
  - Valid user credentials are required and must be entered on the "Authentication"
    page of the interactive playground before sending requests to the server. The
    documentation does not specify the exact authentication scheme, header names,
    parameter names, or credential format needed.
- information_source; https://docs.b2ihealthcare.com/snow-owl/setup-and-administration/advanced-configuration/security:
  - HTTP Basic or Bearer authentication is required. For Basic auth, send a base64-encoded
    user/pass pair in the Authorization header. For Bearer auth, send a JWT token
    generated by Snow Owl in the Authorization header. Authorization is role-based;
    users must have appropriate role assignments to perform actions on resources.
    Snow Owl responds with HTTP 401 Unauthorized if authentication fails.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.b2ihealthcare.com/snow-owl/rest-apis/native:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes items
    array with offset, limit, and total fields indicating current position and total
    count. Use offset value plus limit to construct the next request; stop when offset
    plus limit reaches or exceeds total.
  - Requests returning multiple items are paginated to 50 items by default. Use the
    searchAfter query parameter to request further pages.
