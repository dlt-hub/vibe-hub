auth_info:
- information_source; https://zenko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/apis/cloudserver/common_features/https_protocols.html:
  - Zenko REST API uses an Authorization header for authentication. The Authorization
    header contains the information required for authentication and is a typical request
    header found in Zenko requests. The documentation references RFC 2616 for HTTP
    protocol compliance but does not specify the exact authorization scheme, token
    format, credential acquisition method, or how to construct the Authorization header
    value.
- information_source; https://zenko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/apis/cloudserver/common_features/request_headers.html:
  - The API uses an Authorization header for request authentication. The Authorization
    header must be included in requests and is part of the request signature. Either
    the Date header or the x-amz-date header (with x-amz-date taking precedence if
    both are present) must also be specified in the Authorization header. This appears
    to be an AWS S3-compatible signature-based authentication scheme where request
    headers are signed.
- information_source; https://zenko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/apis/blobserver/Account/SetBlobServiceProperties.html:
  - Azure Blob Storage uses SharedKey authentication, a signature-based scheme. The
    Authorization header must contain "SharedKey" followed by the account name and
    a computed HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request. The signature is derived from
    the account access key and request details including method, content type, date
    (via x-ms-date header), and canonicalized resource path. Only the storage account
    owner with the correct access key can successfully authenticate.
- information_source; https://zenko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/apis/blobserver/Account/GetBlobServiceStats.html:
  - Authorization header is required and must contain the authorization scheme, account
    name, and signature according to Azure Storage authorization rules. The Date or
    x-ms-date header is also required to specify the UTC timestamp for the request.
  - Azure Blob Storage uses SharedKey authentication. The Authorization header must
    contain the account name and a computed HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request.
    Include the x-ms-version and x-ms-date headers with each request; the signature
    is derived from the account key, HTTP method, content properties, and canonicalized
    headers and URI.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://zenko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/apis/blobserver/Account/ListContainers.html:
  - Pagination uses marker-based navigation. Request parameter marker (query string,
    optional) specifies where to resume listing; response field NextMarker indicates
    the marker value for the next request. maxresults (query string, optional) controls
    page size. Stop when NextMarker is absent from response.
  - The List Containers operation uses marker-based pagination. The optional marker
    parameter identifies where to resume listing; the response includes a NextMarker
    field that should be used as the marker value in the next request to get the next
    page. The optional maxresults parameter specifies the maximum number of containers
    to return, with a server default and cap of 5000. Stop paginating when NextMarker
    is not returned in the response.
  - Use maxresults query parameter to set maximum results per request (optional, default
    appears to be higher). Response includes NextMarker element; when present, pass
    its value as marker query parameter in the next request to continue pagination.
    Stop when NextMarker is absent.
