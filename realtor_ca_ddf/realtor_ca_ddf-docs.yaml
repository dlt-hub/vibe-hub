auth_info:
- information_source; https://ddfapi-docs.realtor.ca/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token obtained from the
    previous authentication step in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}"
    with each API request.
  - The DDF Web API uses OAuth2 client credentials grant type for authentication.
    To obtain an access token, send a POST request to https://identity.crea.ca/connect/token
    with x-www-form-urlencoded body containing client_id (username), client_secret
    (password), grant_type set to "client_credentials", and scope set to "DDFApi_".
    The response returns access_token, expires_in, token_type (Bearer), and scope
    fields. Include the access_token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token
    for all subsequent API requests.
  - "The DDF\xAE Web API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. All API requests require\
    \ a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header as \"Authorization: Bearer\
    \ {access_token}\". Tokens are obtained by sending a POST request to an Identity\
    \ Server endpoint with valid data feed credentials; server-to-server token requests\
    \ are recommended over client-to-server requests for security."
  - "The REALTOR.ca DDF\xAE Web API requires bearer token authentication. Include\
    \ an `access_token` with each API call to access endpoints and data. The `access_token`\
    \ is generated using data feed credentials by calling the authentication server."
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://ddfapi-docs.realtor.ca/:
  - Pagination uses OData query parameters $top (page size) and $skip (offset) in
    the request URL. The response includes an @odata.nextLink field containing the
    next request URL with updated $skip value. Use $count parameter to retrieve total
    record count for calculating total pages, though this increases overhead so request
    it once. Results must be sorted to avoid duplicates across pages. For paginating
    beyond 10,000 listings, use dedicated replication endpoints (OfficeReplication,
    MemberReplication, PropertyReplication) which return recently modified records
    sorted by modification timestamp.
  - Results are paginated with a default page size of 20 records, increasable to a
    maximum of 100 using the $top query parameter. If additional pages exist, the
    response includes an @odata.nextLink field containing the URL to the next page;
    use this URL to fetch subsequent pages until @odata.nextLink is absent.
