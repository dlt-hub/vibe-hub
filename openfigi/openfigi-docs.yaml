auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.openfigi.com/api/documentation:
  - The OpenFIGI API supports optional API key authentication to increase rate limits.
    Send your API key in the X-OPENFIGI-APIKEY header with requests. Unauthenticated
    requests are allowed but subject to lower rate limits compared to authenticated
    requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.openfigi.com/api/documentation:
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination. The `start` parameter (optional, in request
    body) contains a cursor value to retrieve the next set of results. The `next`
    property in the response indicates more results are available; use its value as
    the `start` parameter in the subsequent request to continue paginating.
  - The POST /v3/search endpoint uses offset-based pagination with a start parameter
    (request property, optional, indicates result number to start from) and returns
    a next field in the response when more results are available; use the next value
    to construct subsequent requests.
