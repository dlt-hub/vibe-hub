notes:
- The energy endpoints automatically calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated
  with the consumed energy based on relevant emission factors.
- This feature can be used to help businesses estimate and report their scope 1, 2
  and associated scope 3 emissions under the GHG Protocol.
- API key is required for accessing the Climatiq API.
- Climatiq provides an embedded carbon intelligence software that enables developers
  to automate GHG emission calculations based on verified scientific models.
- Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share
  your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or through client-side
  code. When possible, encrypt API keys when you store them.
- By default, audit trails are disabled for all projects. If you are using advanced
  endpoints and want to access the audit trail feature, please contact us for more
  information.
- Batch endpoints always preserves the order between requests and responses.
- Currently, all batch endpoints are limited to a maximum of 100 operations per request.
- Authorization requires a Bearer token containing your Climatiq API key.
- This feature is currently in preview.
- The management API key is scoped to a user.
- This feature is currently in preview. There might still be bugs or edge cases.
- The leg in the `route` array of the response will contain various properties related
  to the leg of the trip.
- A route cannot by default have more than three legs. If you need more than three
  legs, you can call the API endpoint multiple times.
- Different vehicle types have different requirements and options.
- EXIOBASE margins are experimental and are subject to potentially significant uncertainties.
- Tax margins can be negative, which typically occurs when subsidies are applied.
- Request headers require Authorization with a Bearer token containing your Climatiq
  API key.
- Requires API key in the Authorization header.
- Batch endpoint allows for up to 100 calculations with one API call.
- All the cloud computing endpoints expect you to provide the cloud provider in the
  url.
- The default value for duration_unit is 'hour'.
- The default value for average_vcpu_utilization is '0.5'.
- The batch endpoint allows for up to 100 calculations with one API call.
- Use custom mapping endpoints only with data version '0.0' for now.
- This endpoint does currently not support excluding radiative forcing.
- The API doesn't automatically calculate emissions for e.g. transfers to/from airports
  or train stations.
- The endpoint works for one-way travel for one passenger.
- If you attempt to estimate without suggestion using a premium source that your API
  key does not have access to, the estimate will still work, but the CO2e values will
  not be provided.
- Preview endpoints are not available without explicitly opting in.
- This feature is currently in preview. There might still be bugs or edge cases we
  haven't covered.
- If you would like to opt-in to this preview feature, please contact us.
- Climatiq is a carbon intelligence platform. It provides an AI-powered carbon calculation
  engine and the world's largest database of carbon impact data, enabling carbon visibility
  across business processes for informed decision-making and meaningful emission reductions.
- Comprehensive data covering carbon dioxide and all constituent gases.
- Data is verified through expert manual review and AI-driven outlier detection.
- Requires authentication setup for API access
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- 'New status code 503: The API issues this code for temporarily unavailable features.'
- Data versions are only relevant if you are using Climatiq’s /search or /estimate
  endpoints.
- New feature for travel emissions toolkit is a paid add-on.
- Data versioning allows users to opt-in to changes for emission factors.
- Access to ecoinvent data requires a paid license.
- New data quality flags introduced for better query filtering.
- The new search endpoint replaces the deprecated list emission factors endpoint.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Automate emission estimations for over 12.000 different activities, products, services,
  processes, and transactions through our API.
- Up to 250 API calls/month for the Community plan
- Non-commercial use only for the Community plan
- Requires setup of connected app in Climatiq
- Climatiq provides an AI-powered carbon calculation engine and the world's largest
  database of carbon impact data.
- API may have rate limits that need to be respected.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Climatiq is a carbon intelligence platform.
