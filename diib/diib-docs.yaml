notes:
- Prices for our products are subject to change without notice.
- We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service without notice at any
  time.
- Easy onboarding and they added an integration just for our use case, thanks again!
  We didn't have insights into our api load before and this helps very much.
- Once your project is created, an API key is automatically generated for you
- Usually you will create an API key for the different environments you want APItoolkit
  to track from (e.g., development, staging, production, etc.)
- We take security seriously at APItoolkit. We employ encryption and authentication
  measures to ensure the security of your data during transmission and storage.
- Set the APITOOLKIT_KEY environment variable to your .env file.
