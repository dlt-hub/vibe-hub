auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://help.boldreports.com/embedded-reporting/javascript-reporting/report-viewer/reportserver-report/
  : - Authorization uses a bearer token passed via the `serviceAuthorizationToken`
      property in the viewer configuration. The token must be prefixed with "bearer
      " and is sent to authenticate requests to the Bold Reports service endpoints.
    - The Bold Reports Viewer requires bearer token authentication passed via the
      `serviceAuthorizationToken` property in the configuration object. The token
      value should be formatted as "bearer <server token>" where the server token
      is generated through the Bold Reports Server user authentication flow. This
      token is used to authorize requests to the report service URL at `https://service.boldreports.com/api/Viewer`.
- ? information_source; https://help.boldreports.com/cloud-reporting/developer-guide/how-to/generate-access-token-for-bold-reports-server/
  : - Access tokens are generated through the Bold Reports Server UI by navigating
      to Profile > Personal Access Token tab and selecting a token expiration duration.
      The generated token is then used for API authentication, typically sent in request
      headers as a bearer token or in query parameters depending on the specific API
      endpoint.

  : - The API uses a token-based authorization approach. A serviceAuthorizationToken
      string parameter must be obtained by making a POST request to the reporting
      service's authentication endpoint (e.g., /api/get-user-key) with userid and
      password credentials, then passed to the report viewer to authorize access to
      the reportServiceUrl.
- ? information_source; https://help.boldreports.com/report-viewer-sdk/javascript-reporting/report-viewer/api-reference/members/
  : - 'The API uses a token-based authorization scheme. Clients must obtain an authorization
      token by posting userid and password to an authentication endpoint, then pass
      this token via the serviceAuthorizationToken parameter to authorize requests
      to the reporting service URL.


      Key details: POST to authentication endpoint with userid and password fields
      in the request body; the returned token is passed as the serviceAuthorizationToken
      string parameter to the report viewer configuration.'
