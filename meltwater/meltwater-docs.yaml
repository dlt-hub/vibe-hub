notes:
- 'The `period` parameter can take values: 24hours, 7days, 30days, 12months.'
- Calls to endpoints, unless discussed above, are limited to 100 calls / minute.
- There is a global platform-wide rate limit of 2000 requests per hour per IP address.
- Alternatively if you are using Meltwater SSO you can enter the API Key to use access
  the Meltwater API
- No elements found. Consider changing the search query.
- List is empty.
- API allows for exporting, streaming, and analyzing listening data.
- Once the status is ACTIVE there will be results in JSON format at the data_url
- If the status is still PENDING, the data_url will still be available, but just contain
  an empty list of documents
- The search will be inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time.
- Timezone in search results will always be in UTC.
- The period you can analyze depend on your Meltwater API package.
- The `limit` parameter defaults to 10 and has a maximum value of 100.
- You need access to the 'Data Streams' feature in your API package to use this feature.
- Each time a batch of documents match your search, the Meltwater API will deliver
  a JSON payload to your target URL.
- The API allows you to list saved filter sets, and apply these when creating and
  updating saved searches.
- The API does not support creating, updating or deleting filter sets.
- Exported posts will only have ID and author details.
- Templates designed for developers integrating Meltwater data into their solutions.
- API customers need to call the X API to rehydrate the post in order to get the post
  text.
- The maximum time range for a search is 12 months.
- The maximum time range for an analysis is 12 months.
- You need to provide your API token when you call any Meltwater API endpoint.
- You need access to the Meltwater API, plus Engage or Social Analytics features in
  the Meltwater application to use these features.
- All your connections are returned in one call, regardless of the social network.
- You need to provide account IDs to fetch metrics.
- IDs for LinkedIn accounts are in the format urn:li:organization:<id>.
- Use 'twitter' as the source name in API requests.
- Requires Meltwater API token for access.
- Calls are limited to 100 requests per minute.
- Maximum 500 documents per request
- Ingestion is controlled by the user
- Connector is not currently listed in Power BI as a data source.
- The connector works well for reports in Power BI Desktop, but not for Power BI Service.
- Power BI Service may say your data source credentials are invalid or incomplete,
  even with a valid API key.
- Currently the connector for Looker Studio does not support earned media content
  (the API export feature).
- Make sure you have an ACTIVE (recurring) or FINISHED (one-time) export available
  in the API.
- All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
- API requests without authentication will also fail.
- Social Analytics features are accessible to customers with API access and an Engage
  package.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Meltwater
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- You need access to Engage or Social Analytics features in the Meltwater application
  to use these features, and these features are only available to Beta participants.
- If you have multiple companies set up for your Meltwater account, you can specify
  a search belonging to one of your other companies using the company_id parameter.
- You can download the results in CSV and JSON format.
- Only one export will be processed at a time.
- If you do not access the data for a recurring export for over 30 days your recurring
