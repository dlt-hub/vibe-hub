client:
  auth: An API key is required and can be obtained by visiting your account settings
    to generate one, and it should be applied as a parameter in your requests; this
    key allows access to your entire account, so it should not be used in client-side
    code.
  most_recurring_base_url: https://dedimc.promo
  paginator: Pagination is required, and it can be applied using the parameters `limit`
    for page size and `start` for the starting index; a default page size of 5 is
    suggested, and the cursor path is indicated by `next_start` for the next page.
