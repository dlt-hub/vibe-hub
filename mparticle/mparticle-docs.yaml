  - All Analytics API endpoints require an API Key to identify the Analytics project.
    The API Key can be submitted either as a JSON field named apiKey in the POST request
    body, or as a path parameter {Your API KEY} in the URL. The track events endpoint
    requires POST method with Content-Type header set to application/json.
  - The API requires an API key for authentication. Send the apiKey field in the JSON
    request body (for POST requests) or as a query parameter (for GET requests) with
    value "Your-API-Key" or your actual API key. The apiKey field is mandatory for
    all event requests to the Analytics API endpoint.
  - The API uses API Key authentication. The API key can be provided either in the
    URL path as a path parameter (e.g., `https://api.indicative.com/service/identify/{Your
    API KEY}`) or in the JSON request body as the `apiKey` field. Both the Identify
    and Alias endpoints accept this authentication method with Content-Type application/json
    POST requests.
  - The API uses an API Key for authentication, which can be provided either in the
    URL path as a path parameter `{Your API KEY}` or in the JSON request body as the
    `apiKey` field. Both the Suppress and Delete endpoints at `https://api.indicative.com/service/suppress`
    and `https://api.indicative.com/service/delete` accept POST requests with Content-Type
    application/json and require the apiKey parameter.
  - The API uses an API key for authentication. Pass the apiKey parameter as a query
    string parameter in GET requests to the /service/event endpoint, or include it
    in the JSON POST body for batch requests to /service/event/batch with Content-Type
    application/json.
