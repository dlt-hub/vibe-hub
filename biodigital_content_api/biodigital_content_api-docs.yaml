  - OAuth2 bearer token authentication using client credentials flow. Obtain credentials
    by Base64 encoding your app key and secret (concatenated with a colon), then exchange
    them via HTTP POST to the /token endpoint with Authorization header set to "Basic"
    followed by the Base64 encoded credentials. The request body must include grant_type
    set to "client_credentials" and scope set to "contentapi". Headers must have Accept
    set to "application/json" and Content-Type set to "application/json;charset=UTF-8".
    The response provides a bearer access token for subsequent API requests.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with Base64-encoded basic auth. Combine YOUR_DEVELOPER_KEY
    and YOUR_DEVELOPER_SECRET as "key:secret", encode to Base64, and send in the Authorization
    header. POST to TOKEN_ENDPOINT with JSON body containing grant_type set to "client_credentials"
    and scope set to "grant_scope". The response contains an access token for subsequent
    API calls.

    scope set to "grant_scope" in the JSON request body to the TOKEN_ENDPOINT.

  : - Access tokens are required and must be sent as Authorization Bearer tokens in
      request headers. The token must have appropriate permissions for the requested
      API scope, must not be expired, and must be properly formatted. If the token
      lacks required permissions, is expired, or is malformed, an access_denied error
      (code 1030, status 400) is returned.
