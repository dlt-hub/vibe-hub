notes:
- Lucee 6.2 supports both Jakarta and legacy namespaces.
- Lucee Documentation is developed and maintained by the Lucee Association Switzerland
  and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
  Unported License.
- Lucee 5.4 (LTS till Dec 31st 2025) supports Java 8 and 11
- Lucee 6.0 supports Java 11, with Java 8 unofficially supported as long as practical
- Lucee 6.1 supports Java 11 and Java 21 (recommended)
- Lucee 6.2 (our next LTS release) supports both the Javax and Jakarta Servlets, thus
  supporting Tomcat 10 and newer
- Lucee 7.0 supports Java 11, 21 and 24 and only supports Jakarta Servlets, thus requiring
  Tomcat 10 or newer
- Lucee Server is a CFML engine.
- Lucee does not support 'lazy' attribute in cfproperty
- Implicit parsing of date values in locale format is not supported
- Lucee 6 === works like javascript, comparing type and value, however, prior to 6.2.3.34,
  it was sensitive to the underlying java types [LDEV-5806](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-5806)
- Some examples demonstrate usage of operators in code snippets.
- Lucee by default will parse dotted form fields and url parameter names into structs,
  which differs from ACF.
- Lucee Documentation is developed and maintained by the Lucee Association Switzerland.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Backwards compatibility is considered super important in Lucee.
- Deprecation also flags that the given feature might possibly be removed in a future
  major release of Lucee, therefore it acts as advice to stop using the functionality.
- Refer to the Lucee Server ChangeLog for the full list of changes.
- Breaking changes between Lucee versions
- The AI support feature is experimental and the function API may be subject to change.
- All the CFML ajax/client side tags are considered deprecated in Lucee and are only
  provided for minimal backwards compatibility.
- Uses ESAPI for encoding and decoding input to prevent XSS
- Some functions are deprecated and should not be used
- Lucee Extensions add additional functionality, such as tags or functions, JDBC support
  or admin plugins
- When writing a Lucee Extension in Java, remember to only use the java / functions
  / api from the Lucee Loader interface
- Provides an interface to LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol directory servers
  like the Netscape Directory Server.
- Ortus have forked the original Lucee ORM extension and are actively maintaining
  it.
- The Lucee ORM extension is no longer maintained, anyone still using the Lucee version
  is advised to migrate.
- Canonicalization is important for security against validation filters.
- Lucee supports printing to a local printer using via the print extension
- Redis support is provided by the Redis Extension
- By default, Lucee uses the older Oro Regex Engine, which is compatible with ACF.
- Lucee supports using the more modern, compatible engine built into java.
- The Lucee Search support via the Lucene extension is no longer maintained and is
  not recommended for new projects.
- Comprehensive guide on session handling and configuration in Lucee, including session
  types, storage options, and security considerations.
- The why and how to use a database for session data storage.
- Easy Parallelism in Lucee
- Safe Concurrency with Lucee
- Lucee uses the Axis 1 engine, ACF use the Axis 2 engine, so result may differ
- These functions are provided for backward compatibility and there are no plans from
  the Lucee team to update the engine as it's a lot of work for a legacy technology
- Lucee will look for a .cfm file that matches the name of the current action being
  run.
- An Extension Provider can easily be registered in the Lucee Administrator.
- The download file needs to be a zip file that is renamed to .rep.
- As of this writing (Infinispan 5.0.1), asymmetric caches are not supported.
- Cache creation at runtime is not supported.
- Membase is designed to manage very large sets of data in a complex distributed environment.
- Some operations like getting the list of the keys actually cached are not supported.
- Running MongoDB using Replica Sets is strongly recommended.
- CouchDB must be running to connect.
- Default port for CouchDB is 5984.
- Creating an extension in Lucee is convention based.
- A Lucee Extension file is a zip file but with a .lex file extension.
- This extension installs a tag, that when used shows you where to have a Beer nearby.
- Abstract components/functions cannot be used directly, can only extend them.
- Final modifier prevents extending a component/function.
- The attribute cachedWithin has been added to the tags cffile and cfhttp.
- 'Lucee 5 supports two types of cachedWithin: request and timespan.'
- Class updating is now an integral part of Lucee 5.
- Lucee 5 can dynamically load the 'java-agent' at runtime.
- The Lucee dialect was removed in 6.1, as it was barely used and removing it made
  Lucee faster for CFML.
- This is just a first peek of what is possible with the Lucee dialect, more will
  come soon!
- The createObject function can be used to load a class by defining an OSGi bundle
  and version.
- Function createObject has been extended to load classes via OSGi bundle.
- Functions for handling locales and web services have been added.
- Lucee 5 is completely OSGi based, OSGi is the defacto standard in most Java enterprise
  environments, to manage bundles (jar libraries) used by the environment.
- OSGi allows for the running of different versions of the same library at the same
  time.
- Lucee can update every library it is using at any time without issue and without
  the need to restart the JVM.
- Unquoted values for tag attributes are handled as strings by default, however with
  Lucee 5 there is now a setting in the Administrator where you can select to handle
  these values as variables instead.
- Lucee 5.2 requires Java 1.8, only Lucee 5.3 supports Java 9.
- Lucee JARs are handled by Lucee and not by the servlet engine.
- The default place where BlazeDS looks up its configuration is in the /app-root/WEB-INF/flex
  directory, where BlazeDS loads the services-config.xml.
- To call a Lucee cfc from Flex you need to add specific configurations in services-config.xml
  and remoting-config.xml.
- You need the LuceeAdapter on your classpath, which means that you need to copy the
  lucee.jar in your libs directory.
- The CLI is currently available for Windows, Linux and OS X
- The current incarnation of the CLI contains the libs needed to run Lucee
- Installing and updating will change, as the discussion/experimentation evolves
- Default http port is 8088, and configurable with the --port argument
- Default stop-port (socket to listen on for shutdown request) is 8779, and configurable
  with the --stop-port argument
- Default URL to open after starting is <http://$host:$port>, and configurable with
  the --open-url argument
- Preventing the Flex integration in Lucee to create unnecessary WEB-INF directories
- It should be possible to use Lucee without Flex and therefore it would be good if
  one can get rid of this directory.
- Capistrano connects by ssh to the servers and update the code from the source code
  system (git, svn...)
- Each time we deploy, capistrano creates a new directory and move a link named 'current'
  to this new checkout.
- The production server must have access to the git server.
- 'The WEB-INF directory could be problematic: create a directory in /var/www/myproject/shared/WEB-INF
  with write permission to tomcat user.'
- One thing to mention is, that if you turn off scope cascading in the Lucee administrator
  you might obtain different results.
- Resources can be used in any file related tag or function.
- Lucee takes care of the background file handling.
- If Lucee does not start, check whether the service Lucee 2.0 runs
- IIS and Resin need to mirror their configuration
- Plesk causes issues with IIS settings, particularly with 32-bit applications.
- Ensure that Enable 32 Bit Applications is set to False in Application Pool Defaults
  to run 64-bit applications.
- For mixed 32/64 bit environments, individual AppPools can be set to allow 32-bit
  applications.
- The Lucee install does a lot of the work for you but we do have to do a few things.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields.
- Lucee documentation available online
- Tomcat's built in web server needs to be configured to render assets, but this is
  simple to do once you know how.
- Symlinks work well to allow for efficient, side by side testing of ACF and Lucee
  to ensure compatibility if you are thinking of migrating an app to Lucee.
- Lucee uses Apache Lucene for full text indexing
- All instances will serve the same website.
- Configure Tomcat to load the new lucee lib directory.
- This file will be the 'template' for the 3 instance that we will configure later.
- 'Each tomcat instance will listen on different ports: 8081, 8082, and 8083.'
- Lucee admin can be accessed at http://www.mysite.com/lucee/admin/server.cfm.
- Requires password for all actions.
- Some locales not support some of the date time formats which was usually supported
  by other locales.
- 'The locale file needs the java masks (ex: mm for Minute)'
- Uses Lucee Express 5.4 LTS version as a starting point
- 'Example directory on Windows: D:\luceedebug_example\'
- 'Example directory on Linux/MacOs: /opt/luceedebug_example/'
- Tomcat runs the Lucee CFML Engine on the default port 8888
- The Lucee Server Side Debug (JAVA AGENT) runs on localhost:9999
- The main focus of Kabang is to improve the Lucee Administrator and debugging output.
- We removed some core functionality to the extensions.
- In version 5.3 we use the libraries coming from JRE itself so they are already there.
- Java 8 is the minimal requirement to run Lucee kabang (Lucee 5.3)
- Up to 50% faster - Major performance improvements over Lucee 5.4
- Java 8 dropped - Java 11+ required, Java 21 recommended
- PreciseMath off by default - For better performance
- Experimental in 6.2, production-ready in 7.0
- Java 8 dropped - Java 11+ required
- PreciseMath default changed - Now off by default
- Cookie expires now GMT - Was UTC previously
- 'Single Mode Only: Multi-mode is gone - this is THE biggest change for users'
- Faster Startup and Deployment is up to 3x faster than 6.2
- 'Fresh Install Required: Cannot upgrade via admin - requires Tomcat 10.1+ and new
  extensions'
- 'Security First: Better defaults, removed insecure legacy features'
- Fresh install required for Lucee 7
- Tomcat 10.1+ is required
- Lucee Installer is the recommended solution for production installations.
- Lucee can run on various platforms including Windows, Linux, and RaspberryPI.
- This guide is a work in progress. Please be patient, more to come ;-)
- The standard installation directory for Lucee is /opt/lucee/.
- Consider using a phrase as a password for better security.
- While there isn't currently an official Lucee installer for MacOS, there are still
  several other ways to run Lucee on a Mac.
- Mod_cfml is a web server module which automatically configures your webserver to
  work with Tomcat and Lucee, automatically creating Lucee web server contexts from
  your webserver's existing configuration.
- It supports Apache, NGINX and IIS
- Securing /WEB-INF/ by moving it outside of the web root
- By default, Lucee places its web-context configuration and data files in a folder
  named WEB-INF within the web root of each website.
- The WEB-INF folder structure gets created automatically when Lucee gets called to
  serve up a .cfm/.cfml file.
- Updating via the Administrator may not work if you are behind a firewall
- A fresh install is recommended, as it bundles a recent version of Tomcat and the
  last Railo release was several years ago.
- Lucee will rewrite some of the configuration files in your existing installation.
  It will also do a backup of the original contents as a zip file.
- When it first starts, Lucee rewrites the server context and all individual web contexts.
  All the changes made are logged in detail to the application.log log file.
- Partially or fully Java based extensions that rely on certain Railo interfaces may
  not work and could possibly prevent Lucee from starting.
- The original Railo extension produced by TeamCfAdvance is not compatible with Lucee
  and should be removed.
- 'If you have installed the Video extension, you may see the following error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
  railo/runtime/video/VideoExecuter.'
- Lucee is highly compatible with ACF, and most of your cfml/cfscript code that runs
  on ACF will run on Lucee without any modifications.
- There are, however, some known issues of compatibility that you should be aware
  of, and that might affect your application if your code utilizes the affected features.
- Lucee Admin can be disabled by setting the env var LUCEE_ADMIN_ENABLED=false which
  is recommended for production/internet facing servers
- Setting the env var LUCEE_LOGGING_FORCE_APPENDER=console globally overrides all
  logging configuration, to log out the console, using the existing configured log
  levels.
- This should be disabled for production servers by the following .CFconfig.json directives,
  or supply your own templates.
- Use a sitewide error handler, so you do not disclose sensitive information about
  your system.
- Use SSL if you have users logging into your site, even if it's a self-signed cert.
  Secure your cookies.
- Run Lucee under a dedicated user with limited access
- Remove the Lucee admin files if not needed
- Validate user input, sanitize user output
- Set IPs allowed to see debugging output in the Lucee Administrator.
- On Windows it is recommended to run the Lucee/Tomcat service as a restricted user
  with only the required permissions rather than under SYSTEM account.
- Production servers should be configured to use the error-public.cfm templates, for
  both Error and Missing templates, which only display a generic error message.
- The admin will always display the number of items that are currently stored in the
  cache.
- Don’t be surprised that some elements reappear in the template cache. In order to
  flush the cache some templates had to be called and they land in this cache.
- Make sure the WEB-INF directory is locked down.
- Disable detailed error messages in Lucee.
- Ensure all administrators for all contexts have passwords assigned and use captcha.
- Reduce request timeouts as low as possible.
- Ensure Lucee's 'Script-Protect' feature is enabled.
- Avoid using system-heavy client variables.
- Set session timeouts to as low as possible.
- Keep datasource permissions simple.
- Use a separate DB user for each DSN.
- Consider using a web application firewall (like FuseGuard).
- Port 8888 in a default Lucee Installer configuration is the Tomcat web server port.
- It is recommended that you only initiate Tomcat shutdown commands from the local
  console.
- It is recommended that your begin by installing a fresh copy of your Linux OS on
  to your server.
- It is also recommended that you perform a 'minimal' install of your OS.
- During most Linux installation processes, the installer will prompt you if you want
  to configure any initial firewall rules.
- It is recommended that you both enable the firewall, and only allow the most basic
  firewall exceptions, such as SSH access (port 22), HTTP access (port 80), and HTTPS
  access (443).
- It is recommended that you begin by installing a fresh copy of your Linux OS on
  to your server.
- It is recommended that you perform a 'minimal' install of your OS.
- Once the initial minimal firewall is configured by the installation process, you
  should only add rules as absolutely necessary and if you can, add incoming IP Address
  restrictions on them.
- It is important to install all available patches as soon as possible on your new
  system.
- The Lucee Image Extension requires fontconfig to be installed, as fonts aren't always
  installed by default on headless servers.
- Lucee uses the JVM's default timezone, which comes from the operating system.
- You can override this default via the Lucee Admin under, Settings, Regional.
- The regional configuration in the .xml files are stored under the regional tag,
  these are the files which the Lucee Admin updates.
- When deploying by Docker, the timezone defaults to Etc/UTC.
- To set the timezone of the container use a Docker environment variable with the
  name TZ.
- Lucee 5.4 is in LTS mode, any new submissions should target the 6.2 branch
- Java 21 is fully supported since 6.1
- Recently (July 2024) we experienced a problem with Docker pull limits being hit,
  causing our CI (Github Actions) to fail
- On Windows, excluding your Lucee working directory from both Windows Defender and
  Windows Search Indexer will speed up the build process a bit.
- If you are using VS Code and the cflint plugin, make sure you exclude the temp/**
  and loader/** folders, otherwise cflint may go bananas during the build process.
- This documentation is for an old version of Lucee.
- This documentation is for an old version of Lucee. If you want to build the current
  version of Lucee, please see Building Lucee 5 & 6 from source.
- Lucee allows you to use CFML code within your Java applications.
- Lucee's policy is to update the libraries shipped with Lucee only in a major version
  release.
- If you upgrade a library you risk breaking the code that uses that library as not
  all libraries are 100% backward compatible, so do it judiciously and only if you
  must.
- By default, Lucee's deploy.log is set to ERROR, to debug or see more detailed logging,
  change the log level for deplog.log, under Settings, Logging in the Lucee Server
  Administrator to TRACE.
- 6.0.0.300 is just an example SNAPSHOT / version number, best you pick the latest
  snapshot to develop against
- Get involved in the Lucee Project
- Engage with other Lucee community members via the Mailing List
- The InstallBuilder Software that is used for creating the Lucee Installers have
  several built-in strings in all supported languages that it uses for common messages.
- There is a three strike policy in place for people abusing the goodwill of the community.

- Lucee 7 introduces significant improvements to dynamic proxy creation.
- Docker containers ensure that Lucee and its dependencies are packaged together,
  eliminating compatibility issues and reducing setup time.
- The LUCEE_BUILD environment variable is used to prewarm Lucee, setting up the environment
  the first time it starts.
- Setting the LUCEE_BUILD environment variable to true prewarms the Lucee server.
- Multiple users have reported performance problems, due to configuring directories
  under lucee-server as docker volumes.
- Encryption/Decryption requires generation of RSA keys.
- Available since Lucee 7.0
- This feature was partially available as an experimental feature in Lucee 6.2, but
  should not be used in production systems with that version.
- The complete, stable implementation is available starting with Lucee 7.0.
- Creates and defines a component object; encloses functionality that you build in
  CFML and enclose within <cffunction> tags.
- All SQL types are supported with and without the CF_SQL_ prefix.
- You can use either the CF_SQL_ prefix or just the type name (e.g., VARCHAR instead
  of CF_SQL_VARCHAR)
- The CF_SQL_ prefix style is more explicit but longer
- Always use SQL types with dynamic values to prevent SQL injection
- The null attribute can be used with any SQL type to pass NULL values to the database
- Single Mode consolidates all configurations into a single context.
- Multi Mode allows for separate configurations for each web context.
- Server.cfc executes when the Lucee Server starts up.
- Web.cfc executes for each web context.
- The Lucee team highly recommends going straight to the latest 6.2 release via a
  fresh install, working thru the breaking changes documents for each release.
- Some of the older extensions have been unbundled from the default Lucee distribution.
- Session cookies default to being secure
- Lucee 6 introduces several breaking changes that may affect existing applications.
- The recommended approach for migrating to Lucee 6 involves enabling compatibility
  mode.
- 'Set the environment variable to maintain double-based calculations globally: LUCEE_PRECISE_MATH=false'
- 'Set the environment variable to enable legacy formatting behavior: LUCEE_DATETIMEFORMAT_MODE=classic'
- When a variable has no scope defined, Lucee will also search available resultsets.
- If enabled, Lucee will validate existing datasource connections reused from the
  datasource pool before using them.
- Prior to Lucee 6, an empty value would be auto cast to null, since Lucee 6 only
  strings are handled this way [LDEV-4410]
- In Lucee 6, this is no longer the default behavior and throws an exception, which
  matches ACF.
- Use Application.cfc for application-specific tags
- 'Set inspectTemplate appropriately: auto or once during development, but never in
  production for better performance'
- Organize tags by purpose
- Lucee is still an untyped language.
- Types are only a check put on top of the language.
- Imports only affect the current template, not the entire request.
- Component mappings point to the root of package paths, not to individual components.
- Mappings defined in the Server Administrator are visible to all web contexts.
- Config import / merging needed to be improved to handle array configs correctly.
- This document explains how to use retry functionality with some simple examples.
- This tag cannot have a body.
- Required with publish ='Yes' A valid filename for the published file.
- 'The function will check for the actual values for its placeholders in 3 places
  (in this order): Function arguments, System properties, and Environment variables.'
- Startup hooks can be configured in multiple ways depending on your use case and
  deployment strategy.
- Websocket integration into Lucee.
- Ensure monitoring is enabled in .CFConfig.json
- Keep monitor logic lightweight to avoid performance degradation
- 'Important: You have to navigate to a .cfm template with your browser first to invoke
  the Application.cfc.'
- 'Important: You have to navigate to a .cfm template with your browser first to invoke
  the Application.cfc above.'
- mod_cfml is not supporting automatic configuration for pure REST web applications.
- Lucee sends REST data with a return format of JSON by default.
- Never accept request timeouts as a regular behavior of your application; always
  try to resolve any request timeout that occurs.
- Despite the name, this is a server level configuration
- Lucee provides a built-in mechanism to capture thread stack traces during startup.
- Thread dump functionality is controlled through environment variables or system
  properties.
- Lucee provides a built-in mechanism to capture thread stack traces during startup,
  which is invaluable for debugging startup performance issues, identifying bottlenecks,
  and understanding what processes are running during Lucee's initialization phase.
- Thread filtering by name is case-insensitive
- Shows elapsed time from the first captured snapshot
- Use descriptive file names with timestamps to avoid overwriting previous captures
- Ensure sufficient disk space, as high-frequency captures can generate large files
- Consider log rotation for production environments
- Thread dumping has minimal performance impact but avoid extremely high frequencies
  (interval=0) in production
- The feature automatically stops after the specified maximum duration to prevent
  indefinite resource usage
- Thread dumps may contain sensitive information from stack traces
- Restrict access to dump files appropriately
- Consider the implications of capturing thread data in shared hosting environments
- Lucee supports two different tag syntaxes within scripts.
- Certain tags cannot be directly translated into migration syntax due to conflicts
  with existing keywords.
- Regular threads and task threads have different characteristics.
- 'Introduced: 6.2.3.15'
- Query result logging helps identify potential OutOfMemory (OOM) issues.
- Logging is triggered when queries return large datasets.
- The performance of QoQ has been dramatically improved for single tables since 5.3.8!
- Lucee QoQ only supports `SELECT` statements; `UPDATE` and `INSERT` aren't yet supported.
- SystemOutput can output both text and complex objects.
- By default, it doesn't output new lines, the second boolean argument, addNewLine
  does what it says.
- No examples for this function.
- Writes a message to a log file.
- For better performance, always use the log attribute with the name of a log which
  is either defined in the admin, or via Application.cfc / <cfapplication> this.logs
- Lucee startup has two stages
- Sometimes the Felix cache gets corrupted, perhaps when updating or messing around
  with extensions.
- You need to create a mapping for the CFC and CFM files in the Administrator.
- Lucee can automatically check for changes in your configuration files from the complete
  server or a single web context.
- Lucee will now check for any changes in the Lucee configuration files every minute,
  and if there is a change, reload it and enable those changes.
- Lucee provides comprehensive support for JSR-223 (Java Scripting API), enabling
  CFML to be used as a scripting language in any environment that supports the Java
  platform.
- Simple build script processing with Ant
- Processing data from mounted volumes or environment variables
- If you aren't running Lucee with a JDK, Lucee falls back on the Janino compiler
  to compile your java code, so any limitations of Janino apply.
- Starting with Lucee 6.2, Maven support has been added to this.javasettings.
- Error templates should be set to error-public, which only shows a generic error
  message, without revealing information about your code or server configuration.
- The Lucee Administrator should ideally be disabled, using the LUCEE_ADMIN_ENABLED=false
- Debugging / Monitoring output templates should never be enabled on Production
- Ensure access to .git folders (or similar) are blocked via the webserver configuration.
- Always use the Latest Stable Release and Java 21+ / Tomcat 11 or equivalent, older
  versions are slower.
- For fast and secure modern cfml applications, Scope Cascading should be disabled,
  as well as search result sets.
- For the best performance in production, Inspect Templates should be set to never.
- Lucee not only allows you to convert an XML file to an object tree (DOM) but also
  supports an event-driven model (SAX).
- Uses XML event-driven model for parsing.
- Memory issues can occur with large XML documents.
- The default region applied when no specific region is passed in a function or VFS
  path.
- Allows Administrators and Developers power to tweak server settings from startup
  without having to configure in the Server Administrators web interface.
- Environment Variables configured globally in OS or user specific.
- Lucee settings are usually configured manually within the Server Administrator for
  server-context or in Web Administrator for web-context.
- Specific server-context settings can be configured with Environment Variables or
  System Properties (since Lucee 5.3).
- When creating batch/shell script files for Tomcat, please make sure their permissions
  are correctly set for the user running Tomcat to read and execute them.
- When using Environment Variables or System Properties you need to consider important
  security implications.
- Storing sensitive information e.g. hashed passwords, access-tokens, user names,
  database names, etc on OS or files has to be considered very carefully.
- Make sure not to publish these files with sensitive data as part of open source
  code in public repositories.
- Environment variables can be set globally in the OS or user-specific.
- For Tomcat, use setenv.bat (Windows) or setenv.sh (Linux) for setting environment
  variables.
- System properties need to be configured in dot notation.
- Set System Properties with CATALINA_OPTS
- Lucee 6.1 changed how you handle Monitoring/Debugging.
- Lucee 6 has completely overhauled this functionality.
- By default, Lucee checks each file for changes at every request.
- Using Inspect Templates 'NEVER' improves performance for production environments.
- Lucee provides powerful and flexible date and time formatting capabilities that
  support multiple locales, timezones, and custom format patterns.
- Always Specify Timezone for User-Facing Dates
- Work with Dates as Objects, Format with Timezone
- Use Appropriate Format Functions
- 'Date formatting mask options include: dd-mmm-yy, short, medium, long, full.'
- Controls how datetimeFormat() interprets pattern masks such as WW and FF.
- Use classic to maintain compatibility with legacy codebases that depend on padded
  output from formatting masks
- Each Application.cfc can define independent application context.
- Lucee searches for the nearest Application.cfc from the current location to the
  webroot.
- This Application.cfc template should serve as a starting point for your applications
  settings running with Lucee CFML engine.
- The serialized data contains the conversation history (complete or partial), including
  any sensitive information shared with the AI.
- Consider encryption if storing the serialized data in external systems.
- This does not affect any other request, you are only changing the application settings
  for the current request.
- Structs are dramatically faster (16-17x) than both bean factories and components
- Bean factories are slightly faster than components and have less memory overhead
- Function closures are less expensive than class creation overhead
- You can configure a different locale globally in the Lucee admin under 'Settings/Regional'.
- You can then configure a different locale for the current request in the Application.cfc
  file.
- Apache POI provides several advantages including format support for .xls and .xlsx.
- Better performance with large spreadsheets.
- Event Gateways can be written in CFML, making it easier for CFML developers.
- Lucee 6.1 improves its support for exception causes, providing better debugging
  and error handling capabilities.
- 'Apache Commons CSV provides several advantages: robust parsing, header support,
  multiple formats, error handling, performance.'
- Lucee runs within a Servlet Engine (such as Tomcat), allowing you to manage multiple
  websites (or web contexts) within a single engine.
- Starting with Lucee 6, you can choose between single or multi mode.
- While we highly recommend updating to Lucee 6 or above, this document outlines how
  to configure Lucee 5 effectively.
- Lucee 5 is not able to resolve external resources like extensions like Lucee 6 is
  able to do.
- Set configurations in the server configuration rather than at runtime in Application.cfc
  whenever possible.
- Store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and database credentials
  in environment variables or system properties using placeholders.
- Lucee automatically handles the retrieval and inclusion of required libraries and
  their dependencies.
- Classloaders are reused efficiently, minimizing resource consumption.
- Java 21 is recommended as it's a LTS release.
- Java 23 is supported
- Java 24-ea works, but there are some issues with date handling
- Java 11 is supported
- Java 8 is no longer supported
- Dynamically switching preciseMath on and off as required is recommended, rather
  than using it all the time.
- Lucee 6.0 introduced Single Mode, Lucee 7.0 only supports single mode (multi-mode,
  i.e. web admins/contexts are removed)
- As of Lucee 6.1, the Lucee Language dialect has been fully removed.
- In Lucee 6.1, the function now returns ($11.34) for negative values, which aligns
  with ACF's behavior.
- These breaking changes in Lucee 6.1 may impact existing applications that rely on
  the old behaviors.
- Review your code to ensure it is compatible with these updates, particularly if
  you are using the Lucee Language dialect, the cfcontent tag with protected files,
  the fileExists() function with HTTP paths, or the dollarFormat() function.
- Lucee 7.0 only supports Single Mode, which was introduced with Lucee 6.0.
- Controls whether tags like cflock and cfquery populate their default result variables
  to local scope when inside a function.
- Enabled by default in Lucee 7
- Prevents cfml files containing java bytecode from being executed.
- Changed to match ACF behaviour since CF9.
- This function does not take any arguments.
- Since version 6.0, all numbers Lucee uses in the runtime are by default BigDecimal
  based and no longer double as before.
- However, for performance reasons, with Lucee 6.2, we reverted the default to the
  old behavior as it's much faster.
- This tag is also supported within <cfscript>
- 'Requires Extension: Compress Tags for Jakarta EE (Lucee 7+)'
- This tag must have a body.
- 'Format to extract can be one of: bzip, gzip, tar, tbz (tar bzip), tgz (tar gzip),
  zip'
- Verifies whether a zip file is valid.
- Lucene 3 Extension introduces enhancements to search capabilities
- Supports vector-based and hybrid search
- Provides content chunking for relevant results
- Lucee's AI capabilities can be enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using
  the Lucene 3 Extension.
- The Lucene extension enables you to create searchable collections of content.
- Uses enhanced content chunking capabilities for better context extraction
- Supports semantic search capabilities for finding relevant content
