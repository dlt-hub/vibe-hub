notes:
- Ensure to query the latest Mission version before making updates.
- Service Break Actions are independent of rides (no ride id can be provided).
- viaPoints functionality is provided for testing purposes only. Do not use this functionality
  in regular mobility operations.
- Routes obtained through the API are purely informative.
- Getting a specific route does not guarantee the same route will be taken by a successive
  mission assignment.
- Mission Update is acknowledged when successful. It returns the new Vehicle Mission
  with a new Mission ID.
- Uses OAuth2 with client credentials — requires setup of client ID and secret.
- Uses OAuth2 with client credentials.
- Streams require handling of reconnection logic.
- v1beta5 uses a completely separate Service/data source from v1beta4.
- Be careful when migrating to ensure that you do not depend on v1beta4 data.
