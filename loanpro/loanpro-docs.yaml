auth_info:
- information_source; https://loanpro.readme.io/docs/api-token-management:
  - API tokens are used for authentication and must be included in requests. Tokens
    are associated with Agent Users and inherit their Role-Based Access settings,
    which control access to specific endpoints and HTTP methods. Tokens have a Status
    field that must be "Active" to authenticate successfully; inactive tokens return
    401 Authentication Error responses. The token itself is the authentication credential
    used in API requests, and multiple tokens can be created per user though this
    is not recommended. Tokens can be labeled, rotated, and managed through the Settings
    > Company > API > Overview interface in the LoanPro environment.
- information_source; https://loanpro.readme.io/docs/enumerated-values-index:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer {token} header is required. Additionally, the Autopal-Instance-Id:
    {Tenant ID} header must be included with requests. Both headers are standard for
    LMS API calls to access enumerated value collections.'
- information_source; https://loanpro.readme.io/docs/generate-a-swipe-processer-swp-token:
  - 'To generate a swipe processor token, send a GET request to the `/api/v2/swipe-processor/new-secret`
    endpoint with two required headers: `Authorization` containing your token and
    `Secret` containing your secret. The response returns a `secret` field containing
    the new swipe processor token, which must be stored and is later used to create
    HMAC-SHA-512 hashes for authorizing card transactions. You can have up to two
    valid tokens at a time; attempting to create a third will error.'
- information_source; https://loanpro.readme.io/docs/create-an-issuer-card-program-and-line-of-credit-program:
  - Authorization header with token value and Secret header with secret value are
    required. Send both as HTTP headers in POST requests to the Secure Payments API.
    The token and secret should be generated API keys from your account setup.
  - 'Authorization is required via two headers: the Authorization header must contain
    a token value (referenced as {token}), and the Secret header must contain a secret
    value (referenced as {secret}). These credentials are passed in the request headers
    for API authentication.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://loanpro.readme.io/docs/filtering-and-paginating-responses:
  - The API uses OData pagination with $top parameter specifying the number of results
    to return and $start parameter specifying where results should begin (for example
    $start=20&$top=30). Pagination parameters are only supported at the root level,
    not for nested associated entities.
  - Use $top query parameter to set page size (maximum results returned). Use $skip
    query parameter to skip a specified number of results, or $skiptoken to skip past
    a specific entity ID (both non-inclusive). Combine with $filter parameter in OData
    requests.
