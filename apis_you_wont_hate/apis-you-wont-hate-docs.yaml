notes:
- Pagination is an important concept in REST APIs.
- Choosing the right pagination strategy depends on your specific use case and dataset
  size.
- Postman documentation is limited and may be inaccurate.
- API’s don’t exist in isolation, clients talk to them and APIs talk to other APIs.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Version 4 committed to launching in 2024.
- API authentication is a strategic design philosophy.
- Strong API authentication must strike a balance between assurance, agility, and
  accountability.
- mTLS is required for high-trust environments such as banking, critical infrastructure,
  or healthcare.
- Authentication is essential but not infallible; continuous detection is necessary.
- Choosing the right authentication method is crucial for API security.
