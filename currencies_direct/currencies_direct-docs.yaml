auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.currenciesdirect.com/api/build/:
  - A valid OAuth2 access token is required to access all API calls. Tokens are obtained
    by making a POST request to https://sandbox.currenciesdirect.com/auth/oauth/v2/token
    with Content-Type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded and Accept header
    set to application/json. The response returns a JSON object containing the access
    token needed for subsequent API requests.
  - All API calls require an Access Token obtained via OAuth2 client credentials flow.
    Send the token in the Authorization header of each request to protected resources.
    To acquire a token, POST to https://api.currenciesdirect.com/auth/oauth/v2/token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded and parameters grant_type
    set to client_credentials, client_id, and client_secret.
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}" for API requests.'
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {access-token}" for all requests. The access token must be obtained
    through an OAuth2 flow (token acquisition method not detailed in this excerpt).
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer {access-token}'. The header name is 'Authorization' and the
    value format is 'Bearer' followed by a space and the access token string.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.currenciesdirect.com/api/build/:
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters page (page number) and limit (maximum records
    per page). Response includes meta_data fields: next_page (URL to next page), previous_page
    (URL to previous page), total_pages (total page count), and total_records (total
    record count).'
  - Response includes next_page and previous_page fields containing URIs to navigate
    pages, along with total_pages and total_records fields indicating pagination state.
    Use the URI values from next_page or previous_page fields to request subsequent
    or previous pages.
  - The API uses query parameter pagination with page and limit parameters. The request
    example shows page=1&limit=100, where page is the page number and limit is the
    number of results per page. The documentation does not specify response fields
    indicating pagination state or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata fields: next_page and previous_page
    contain URIs to navigate pages, while total_pages and total_records indicate the
    total number of pages and records available. Use the next_page URI to fetch the
    subsequent page of results.'
  - The response includes pagination metadata with next_page and previous_page as
    URIs to navigate pages, total_pages indicating the total number of pages, and
    total_records showing the total number of records available. Use the next_page
    URI to fetch subsequent pages until no next_page is returned.
