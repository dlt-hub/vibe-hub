auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.snapschedule.com/docs/ss365/api-v2/index.html:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used for authentication. Obtain an access token
    by sending a POST request to the token endpoint with grant_type set to "client_credentials",
    client_id, and client_secret as form-encoded parameters. The token endpoint is
    located at {apiEndpoint}/api/v2/oauth2/token. Use the returned access token in
    subsequent API requests.
  - Snap Schedule API uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow for authentication. To obtain
    an access token, make a POST request to https://app.snapschedule365.com/api/v2/oauth2/token
    with grant_type set to "client_credentials", client_id, and client_secret in the
    request body. Include the returned access token in the Authorization header of
    subsequent API requests.
- information_source; https://www.snapschedule.com/docs/ss365/api/:
  - All request headers must include an access token (if logged in). The access token
    should be included in the request headers. A 401 Unauthorized HTTP status code
    indicates the access token was invalid or missing. Specific header name and token
    format details are not provided in this documentation excerpt.
- information_source; https://www.snapschedule.com/docs/ss365/api/timeoffrequests.html:
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the request
    header (the example code comments indicate adding the access token to the request
    header, though the exact header name is not explicitly stated in this excerpt,
    standard practice for bearer tokens is the Authorization header with "Bearer"
    scheme).
- information_source; https://www.snapschedule.com/docs/ss365/api/timeoffschedules.html:
  - Access tokens must be included in the request header when calling the API. The
    example code demonstrates adding the access token to the HTTP request header for
    authentication.
