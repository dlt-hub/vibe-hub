auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/javascript-adapter:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}" when making requests to protected RESTful services.
    The token is obtained after user authentication via Keycloak and should be refreshed
    before use by calling the updateToken() method, as access tokens have short expiration
    times by default.
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/client-registration:
  - 'The Keycloak Client Registration endpoints require bearer token authentication.
    Send the token in the Authorization header as "Authorization: bearer <token>",
    where the token is either an initial access token or a bearer token obtained through
    OpenID Connect. The token must be included with POST requests to endpoints like
    /realms/<realm>/clients-registrations/openid-connect, /realms/<realm>/clients-registrations/saml2-entity-descriptor,
    or /realms/<realm>/clients-registrations/default.'
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/client-registration-cli:
  - 'Keycloak Client Registration CLI supports two authentication methods: role-based
    access via user credentials (requiring realm-management roles like manage-clients,
    view-clients, or create-client assigned in the Admin Console), or token-based
    access using Initial Access Tokens or Registration Access Tokens issued by administrators.
    Users without assigned roles must provide an Initial Access Token to authenticate;
    attempting operations without proper credentials or tokens results in a 403 Forbidden
    error.'
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/token-exchange:
  - Keycloak token exchange uses OAuth 2.0 token exchange flow. The requester client
    authenticates to the Keycloak token endpoint using HTTP Basic authentication with
    client credentials, sending a POST request to /realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token
    with an Authorization header containing Basic base64-encoded client_id:client_secret.
    The request body includes subject_token (the original access token to exchange)
    and other token exchange parameters. Clients must be in the same realm to perform
    token exchange.
  - Keycloak token exchange uses OAuth2 client credentials with a custom grant type.
    Send a POST request to the token endpoint with client_id, client_secret, grant_type
    set to "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange", subject_token (existing
    token to exchange), requested_token_type, and audience (target client identifier)
    as form-encoded body parameters. The authenticated client must have a Client Policy
    permission configured in the Admin Console to authorize the token exchange, otherwise
    a 403 Forbidden response is returned.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.4.4/authorization_services/:
  - Pagination for the "Getting permission tickets" endpoint uses query parameters
    first (offset) and max (limit). Stop paginating when the number of returned results
    is less than the max value.
  - When querying permissions, use query parameters first and max to limit results
    for pagination.
- information_source; https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.4.4/upgrading/:
  - All Admin REST API endpoints that support pagination now have a default max results
    of 100. To return more than 100 entries, explicitly specify the max parameter
    with ?max=<RESULTS>.
