auth_info:
- information_source; https://foglamp-bridge.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/rest_api_guide/02_RESTauthentication.html:
  - 'Authentication is performed using a bearer token passed in the authorization
    header. Include the header "authorization: <token>" in all requests. Administrative
    operations require users with administrator privileges.'
  - 'Authorization is required using a bearer token passed in the authorization header.
    The token must be included as "authorization: <token>" in the request headers
    for endpoints that require admin permissions or user access.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the `authorization`
    header (format: `authorization: <token>`). Only admin users can perform certain
    operations like creating users or terminating other users'' sessions.'
  - The API uses token-based authentication obtained via login. Send username and
    password as JSON to POST /flir/login to receive a token, then include the token
    in the Authorization header for subsequent requests. Certificate-based authentication
    is also supported by uploading a certificate to /flir/login. Tokens can be invalidated
    via PUT /flir/logout or PUT /flir/{user_id}/logout.
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication sent via the Authorization header. Clients
    must include the header "authorization: <token>" in requests to authenticate.
    Users can update their own information and change passwords, with admin users
    having additional permissions to modify other user records.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://foglamp-bridge.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.5.0/rest_api_guide/04_RESTuser.html:
  - 'Pagination is controlled via query parameters: limit (optional, default 20) sets
    the number of readings returned, skip (optional) offsets the result set, and seconds
    or minutes (optional, mutually exclusive with limit/skip) specify time-based windows.
    The response contains the requested readings but no explicit next/previous fields
    or continuation tokens are mentioned.'
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (default 20, number of readings),
    skip (offset for readings), or alternatively seconds, minutes, or hours (time-based
    limits that cannot be combined with limit/skip). The previous parameter works
    with time-based limits to retrieve historical data by specifying how long ago
    the returned data should end. Response is an array of JSON objects sorted in reverse
    chronological order.'
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (default 20, number of readings),
    skip (offset for readings), or alternatively seconds/minutes/hours (time-based
    limits, mutually exclusive with limit/skip). The previous parameter works with
    time-based parameters to offset the data range backwards in time. Response is
    an array of JSON reading objects in reverse chronological order with no explicit
    pagination fields.'
  - The API uses offset-based pagination for asset readings. Request parameters include
    limit (optional, defaults to 20) to set the number of readings returned, and skip
    (optional) to specify the number of assets to skip, used together to navigate
    through results.
  - Use query parameters limit (default 20, optional) to set maximum readings returned
    and skip (optional) to offset results for pagination. The skip parameter works
    with limit to retrieve specific ranges of historical readings.
