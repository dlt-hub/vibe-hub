auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.crossborder.corpay.com/apidocscrossborder:
  - Our RESTful API uses OAuth2 with a two-part flow. First, create an HS256-signed
    JWT token with "Issuer" (Partner or Client name) in the claim set and "issued-at"
    and "expiration" fields set 20 minutes apart, then send it in the request body's
    "assertion" field to exchange it for a "CMG-AccessToken". The response provides
    an "access_code" that is used for subsequent authenticated requests. A 401 status
    code indicates the authorization token has expired and needs to be refreshed.
  - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Submit a JWT with "aud" (audience)
    claim set to "cambidgefx", "iat" (issued-at) and "exp" (expiration) claims set
    approximately 20 minutes apart, and sign it with a current auth key. The response
    provides an "access_code" which must be submitted in the "CMG-AccessToken" header
    for subsequent client-level requests; the partner-level request does not require
    this header. The JWT expiration must not exceed approximately 24 hours after issue
    time.
  - Use the Corpay-Signature header included in each webhook POST request to verify
    the authenticity of the payload and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The signature
    is a digital signature that authenticates that the webhook notification came from
    Corpay.

  - 'Authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Token) bearer tokens. Generate a JWT with claims:
    iss (issuer), iat (issued-at, current Unix timestamp), exp (expiration, typically
    current time + 20 minutes), aud (audience, must be "cambridgefx"), and sub (subject,
    can be empty). Sign the token with your auth key. Submit the resulting access_code
    in the CMG-AccessToken header for subsequent client-level requests. Partner-level
    requests do not require CMG-AccessToken header.'
  - Corpay Cross-Border uses OAuth2 with a two-part token flow. First, create an HS256-signed
    JWT token with "Issuer" (Partner or Client name) and "Signature" in the claim
    set, setting "issued-at" and "expiration" 20 minutes apart, then send it in the
    request body "assertion" field to exchange for a "CMG-AccessToken". Use the returned
    access token for subsequent API requests; a 401 status indicates the token has
    expired and needs refresh.
