notes:
- APIs enable partners to customize the FlipGive Rewards user experience
- Cashback offer APIs enable partners to design their own UI / shopping experience
- The embedded storefront does not use SSO but instead passes a user/team token with
  every request via a hashed value which is encoded with a secret key.
- An SSO integration (OAuth 2.0) will need to be built in order for the users to re-use
  their authentication credentials in these white-label applications.
- FlipGive provides a means for fundraisers to raise money through donations, selling
  merchant offers as well as referral shopping trips to online ecommerce websites.
