pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.thenewsapi.com/documentation:
  - Pagination uses page-based navigation with query parameters. Request parameter
    page (optional, defaults to 1) specifies the page number. Response includes meta.page
    (current page), meta.returned (results in current response), meta.limit (results
    per page), and meta.found (total results available). Continue paginating by incrementing
    the page parameter until returned results are fewer than limit or meta.found is
    reached.
  - Pagination uses query parameter limit (default 10) to control page size. Response
    includes meta object with found (total results), returned (results in current
    response), limit, and page (current page number). Construct next request by incrementing
    the page parameter.
  - Pagination uses query parameter page (optional, defaults to 1) to request specific
    pages. Response meta object contains found (total results), returned (results
    in current response), limit (results per page, default 50), and page (current
    page number) to track pagination state.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with optional query parameters limit (number
    of results per page) and page (page number). Response includes meta.found (total
    articles), meta.returned (articles in current response), meta.limit (applied limit),
    and meta.page (current page number).
  - Use the page query parameter (optional) to paginate through results. Response
    includes meta.found for total articles, meta.returned for articles in current
    response, meta.limit for the page size, and meta.page for the current page number.
