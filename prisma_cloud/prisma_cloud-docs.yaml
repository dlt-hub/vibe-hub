  - POST to https://api.prismacloud.io/login with JSON body containing username (Access
    Key ID) and password (Secret Key) to receive a JWT token. Include the JWT in the
    x-redlock-auth header for all subsequent REST API requests. The JWT expires after
    10 minutes and must be refreshed to maintain API access.
  - Prisma Cloud API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. The JWT must be sent
    in the 'x-redlock-auth' header for all API requests. When a JWT expires and returns
    HTTP 401, you must refresh it by making a GET request to 'https://api.prismacloud.io/auth_token/extend'
    with the current JWT in the 'x-redlock-auth' header, then use the new token from
    the response's "token" field in subsequent requests.

  : - AWS AppSync GraphQL API supports API key authentication. The API key is a hard-coded
      value generated by the AWS AppSync service when creating an unauthenticated
      GraphQL endpoint. The authentication type is specified in the authenticationType
      field, which can be set to "API_KEY" either as the primary method or in the
      additionalAuthenticationProviders array.
