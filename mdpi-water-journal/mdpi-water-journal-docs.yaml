notes:
- The platform provides one-stop access to flood-related information.
- Data transmissions are generally required to be completed within 10 min.
- Integrates SOA, AI, and IoT into a multi-layered system
- Real-time monitoring and control capabilities
- Requires authentication and authorization for access.
- Primarily used by high-ranking government officials during flood disaster events.
