notes:
- Uses jQuery for API calls
- When a CSS selector string is passed to .not(), text and comment nodes will always
  be removed from the resulting jQuery object during the filtering process.
- The jQuery library has a full suite of Ajax capabilities.
- Some methods are deprecated, please refer to the documentation for alternatives.
- The .find() method allows searching through the descendants of matched elements.
- As of jQuery 3.2, .contents() returns contents of <template> elements as well.
- The .closest() method begins its search with the element itself before progressing
  up the DOM tree.
- The supplied index is zero-based, and refers to the position of the element within
  the jQuery object, not within the DOM tree.
- Uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.
- The .has() method reduces the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant
  that matches the selector or DOM element.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The .map() method is particularly useful for getting or setting the value of a collection
  of elements.
- The method optionally accepts a selector expression for its second argument.
- Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements.
- Uses .prevAll() method to get all preceding siblings of each element.
- Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered
  by a selector.
- Returns a subset specified by a range of indices.
- By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially
  execute code.
- jQuery doesn't officially support SVG.
- By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially
  execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes
  that execute code (for example, <img onload=''>). Do not use these methods to insert
  strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or
  form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
  Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.
- jQuery doesn't officially support SVG. Using jQuery methods on SVG documents, unless
  explicitly documented for that method, might cause unexpected behaviors.
- By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially
  execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes
  that execute code (for example, <img onload="">). Do not use these methods to insert
  strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or
  form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
  Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.
- As of jQuery 1.9, all the handlers for the jQuery global Ajax events must be attached
  to document.
- If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the
  ajaxComplete event will not fire.
- Due to browser security restrictions, most 'Ajax' requests are subject to the same
  origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain,
  subdomain, port, or protocol.
- Script and JSONP requests are not subject to the same origin policy restrictions.
- Its use is not recommended.
- The settings specified here will affect all calls to $.ajax or Ajax-based derivatives
  such as $.get().
- Uses jQuery for AJAX requests.
- The $.param() method serializes deep objects recursively.
- If a request with jQuery.get() returns an error code, it will fail silently unless
  the script has also called the global ajaxError event.
- Prior to jQuery 1.8, the arguments could be a function or an array of functions.
- Callbacks are executed in the order they were added.
- As of jQuery 3.0, $.parseJSON is deprecated. To parse JSON strings use the native
  JSON.parse method instead.
- As of jQuery 1.9, all the handlers for the jQuery global Ajax events, including
  those added with .on( "ajaxSend", ... ), must be attached to document.
- If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the
  ajaxSend event will not fire.
- If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the
  ajaxStart event will not fire.
- If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the
  ajaxStop event will not fire.
- Globally disable all animations.
- Animations can be turned back on by setting the property to false.
- If you use a custom jQuery build without the effects module, the :animated selector
  will throw an error.
- :animated is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using
  :animated cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- The .attr() method is used to get or set the value of attributes for the first element
  in the set of matched elements.
- The .prop() method gets the property value for only the first element in the matched
  set.
- Attempting to change the type property of an input element created via HTML or already
  in an HTML document will result in an error being thrown by Internet Explorer 6,
  7, or 8.
- This method should not be used to remove built-in (native) properties such as 'checked',
  'disabled', 'selected', or others. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
- In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using .prop() to set a DOM element property
  to anything other than a simple primitive value (number, string, or boolean) can
  cause memory leaks if the property is not removed before the DOM element is removed
  from the document.
- Note that this method currently does not provide cross-platform support for setting
  data on XML documents, as Internet Explorer does not allow data to be attached via
  expando properties.
- Removing an inline `onclick` event handler using `.removeAttr()` doesn't achieve
  the desired effect in Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 11.
- Because `[name!="value"]` is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification,
  queries using `[name!="value"]` cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided
  by the native DOM `querySelectorAll()` method. For better performance in modern
  browsers, use `$( "your-pure-css-selector" ).not( "[name='value']" )` instead.
- .bind() method has been deprecated in jQuery 3.0
- Attaches event handlers to selected elements.
- .delegate() has been deprecated and superseded by the .on() method since jQuery
  1.7
- This API has been removed in jQuery 1.9; please use `on()` instead.
- Use of the `.live()` method is no longer recommended since later versions of jQuery
  offer better methods that do not have its drawbacks.
- The .off() method removes event handlers that were attached with .on().
- The .one() method is identical to .on(), except that the handler for a given element
  and event type is unbound after its first invocation.
- As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree; an event handler can
  stop the bubbling by returning false from the handler or calling the .stopPropagation()
  method on the event object passed into the event.
- This API is deprecated. Use `.on( "mouseenter", handlerIn ).on( "mouseleave", handlerOut
  )` instead.
- :button is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using
  :button cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM
  querySelectorAll() method.
- This method does not accept any arguments.
- The change event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements.
- Changing the value of an input element using JavaScript won't fire the event.
- Because :checkbox is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :checkbox cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method. For better performance in modern browsers, use [type="checkbox"]
  instead.
- Using .clone() has the side-effect of producing elements with duplicate id attributes,
  which are supposed to be unique.
- The .css() method is a convenient way to get a computed style property from the
  first matched element.
- Retrieval of shorthand CSS properties is not guaranteed.
- This API has been removed in jQuery 4.0; please pass a string value with the desired
  units instead.
- deferred.pipe() method is deprecated. Use deferred.then() instead.
- .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects.
- .delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function.
- To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers
  from the child elements before removing the elements themselves.
- As of jQuery 1.7, use of .die() (and its complementary method, .live()) is not recommended.
  Instead, use .off() to remove event handlers bound with .on()
- :eq() is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, use $("your-pure-css-selector").eq(index)
  for better performance.
- The event handler must be attached before the browser fires the error event.
- As of jQuery 3.4, the :even pseudo-class is deprecated. Remove it from your selectors
  and filter the results later using .even() (available in jQuery 3.5.0 or newer).
- Because :even is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :even cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- Because :odd is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :odd cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.3; please use the native Function.prototype.bind
  method instead.
- Introduced in DOM level 3
- Since the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of
  the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events.
- Similarly, events handled by .delegate() will propagate to the elements to which
  they are delegated; event handlers bound on any elements below it in the DOM tree
  will already have been executed by the time the delegated event handler is called.
- Returns a boolean value (true or false) that indicates whether or not the META key
  was pressed at the time the event fired.
- The mouse position relative to the top edge of the document.
- Due to a bug open since 2004, this value is not populated correctly in Firefox and
  it is not possible to know the time the event was created in that browser.
- Uses default duration of 400 milliseconds for animation.
- Easing function defaults to 'swing'.
- All jQuery effects, including .fadeTo(), can be turned off globally by setting jQuery.fx.off
  = true, which effectively sets the duration to 0.
- The returned Promise is linked to a Deferred object stored on the .data() for an
  element.
- Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not
  faster ones.
- To avoid unnecessary DOM manipulation, .fadeOut() will not hide an element that
  is already considered hidden.
- Because :hidden is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :hidden cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- Using this selector heavily can have performance implications, as it may force the
  browser to re-render the page before it can determine visibility.
- Because `:visible` is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification,
  queries using `:visible` cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided
  by the native DOM `querySelectorAll()` method.
- All jQuery effects, including .fadeToggle(), can be turned off globally by setting
  jQuery.fx.off = true, which effectively sets the duration to 0.
- :file is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using
  :file cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM
  querySelectorAll() method.
- Animations may be stopped globally by setting the property $.fx.off to true.
- :first is deprecated in jQuery 3.4. Remove it from selectors.
- The focus event is sent to an element when it gains focus.
- Elements with focus are usually highlighted in some way by the browser.
- The 'focusin' event supports detecting the focus event on parent elements.
- :gt() is deprecated in jQuery 3.4. Remove it from your selectors.
- Because :has() is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :has() cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- Because :header is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries
  using :header cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native
  DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- The value reported by .height() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element
  or its parent is hidden.
- The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .height(), may be fractional
  in some cases.
- This method may cause performance issues, especially when used on many elements.
- This method is not available on XML documents.
- Any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially execute
  code.
- The .text() method should not be used on form inputs or scripts.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- :image is equivalent to [type="image"]
- Queries using :image cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by
  the native DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .innerHeight(), may be
  fractional in some cases.
- The value reported by .innerHeight() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element
  or its parent is hidden.
- The number returned by dimensions-related APIs may be fractional.
- Value may be inaccurate when the element or its parent is hidden.
- The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .width(), may be fractional
  in some cases.
- The value reported by .width() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element
  or its parent is hidden.
- Queries using :input cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by
  the native DOM querySelectorAll() method.
- By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially
  execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes
  that execute code.
- The $.browser property is deprecated in jQuery 1.3, and its functionality may be
  moved to a team-supported plugin in a future release of jQuery.
- Because $.browser uses navigator.userAgent to determine the platform, it is vulnerable
  to spoofing by the user or misrepresentation by the browser itself.
- Supports methods including callbacks.add(), callbacks.remove(), callbacks.fire()
  and callbacks.disable()
- The first argument must be a DOM element, not a jQuery object or plain JavaScript
  object.
- This method currently does not provide cross-platform support for setting data on
  XML documents, as Internet Explorer does not allow data to be attached via expando
  properties.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.7; please use the jQuery.Deferred.getErrorHook
  method instead.
- This is a low-level method, you should probably use .dequeue() instead.
- Functionality should be accessed via the Public and Extension APIs.
- This property is deprecated as of version 3.0, and has no effect in browsers that
  support the requestAnimationFrame method.
- Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same
  origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain,
  subdomain, port, or protocol.
- Copyright 2025 OpenJS Foundation and jQuery contributors. All rights reserved.
- By default, $.getScript() sets the cache setting to false.
- Setting the options explicitly in the call or define a simple plugin is preferred.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.2. Instead of relying on this global switch,
  it's better to put explicitly wait for required code.
- The .ready() method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document
  Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate.
- The $.inArray() method is similar to JavaScript's native .indexOf() method.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.2; please use the native Array.isArray
  method instead.
- Host objects may evaluate inconsistently across browsers.
- As of jQuery 3.3, jQuery.isFunction() has been deprecated.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.3.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.3; if you need this function, reimplement
  it by yourself
- The $.merge() function is destructive.
- This API has been deprecated in jQuery 3.5; please use the native String.prototype.trim
  method instead.
- Pages fetched with POST are never cached.
- The $.speed() method provides a way to define properties, such as duration, easing,
  and queue, to use in a custom animation.
- This API has been removed in jQuery 1.9.
- As of jQuery 3.0, this method is deprecated and just an alias of jQuery.uniqueSort().
- The `keydown` event is sent to an element when the user presses a key on the keyboard.
- The `keypress` event isn't covered by any official specification, the actual behavior
  encountered when using it may differ across browsers, browser versions, and platforms.
