auth_info:
- information_source; https://coinlayer.com/documentation:
  - API access requires an access_key parameter passed as a query parameter in the
    request URL. The access_key is your API credential and must be included in all
    requests to authenticate with the coinlayer API.
  - API calls require an access_key parameter passed as a GET query parameter. The
    access_key should be your unique API key obtained from the coinlayer service.
    Include it in requests as access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY in the query string.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your access key as a query parameter
    named access_key in all requests to the coinlayer API.
  - API requests require an API key passed as a query parameter named access_key.
    The key must be appended to the request URL as a query string parameter (e.g.,
    ?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY). Error code 101 (invalid_access_key) is returned
    if no API key is specified.
  - Authentication uses an API access key passed as a query parameter. Append the
    `access_key` parameter to the base URL https://api.coinlayer.com/ and set it to
    your unique API access key value obtained from your coinlayer account dashboard.
