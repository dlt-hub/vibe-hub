auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.thinkific.dev/hc/en-us/articles/4422657182743-REST-API-Response-Format:
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" with all requests to the REST
    API endpoints.'
- information_source; https://support.thinkific.dev/hc/en-us/articles/4422657425431-Authorization-using-API-Key:
  - Authorization for the Thinkific API uses an API Key associated with a Thinkific
    Site's Subdomain for simple single-site access. The API Key must be sent with
    requests to authenticate; for multi-site or GraphQL API access, OAuth authorization
    is required instead.
  - 'The Thinkific API uses two required headers for authentication: X-Auth-API-Key
    (your API key) and X-Auth-Subdomain (your subdomain). Both must be included in
    request headers. Invalid or missing credentials return a 401 error with message
    "Authentication Error". API access requires a Grow/Pro + Growth Plan or above.'
- information_source; https://support.thinkific.dev/hc/en-us/articles/4422685833751-REST-Permissions-and-Scopes:
  - 'I can see this input contains encoded URLs and references to documentation pages,
    but the actual content of those pages (including any authentication or authorization
    details) is not provided in the text you''ve shared.


    To extract auth information, I need the actual documentation content that describes:

    - How to authenticate (API key, OAuth, bearer token, etc.)

    - Where credentials go (headers, query params, body, etc.)

    - Exact parameter/header names

    - Any token acquisition or refresh flows


    The URLs reference "Authorization using API Key" which suggests auth info exists,
    but I cannot read the linked pages themselves.


    Please provide the actual documentation text or content, and I will extract the
    auth information for you.'
  - Thinkific uses OAuth2 with scope-based access control. Apps must be configured
    with specific OAuth scopes that restrict endpoint access; requests to endpoints
    outside the app's granted scopes will be rejected with a 403 forbidden error and
    message "App does not have permission to perform this action. Please check the
    access token permissions". Scopes are set during app configuration and determine
    what customer data an app can read or write.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.thinkific.dev/hc/en-us/articles/4422657182743-REST-API-Response-Format:
  - Collections are paginated with a default limit of 25 items, overridable to maximum
    250 via the limit query parameter. Use the page query parameter to specify which
    page to retrieve. Responses include a meta key containing pagination data for
    navigation.
