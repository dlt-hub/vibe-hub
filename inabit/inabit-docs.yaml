- inabit works exclusively with anonymized tokens, such as Universally Unique Identifiers
  (UUIDs), to represent client data.
- Businesses using inabit retain full control of their sensitive client data.
- All interactions with inabit’s platform must use anonymized tokens when sending
  client-related data via GraphQL API.
- 'These fields must contain anonymized tokens: externalWalletId, externalTransactionId,
  externalContactId.'
- Approval Required for withdrawals using the API signer.
- Requires setup of API Admin user for authentication
- Withdrawals require approval
- Remember to authenticate to call our GraphQL API using an access token (bearer)
  with your API Admin credentials.
- Remember to authenticate to call our graphQL API using an access token (bearer)
  with your API Admin credentials.
- Withdrawals will require an approval.
- Approvals are given automatically according to the logic decided by the clearer.
- Ensure to complete the Approvals Docker Configuration and execute the API signer
  Setup as a one-time prerequisite.
- Users can grant viewing permissions to their accounts for accounting firms.

- All wallet types are protected by advanced security measures, including encryption,
  two-factor authentication (2FA), and optional multi-sig.
- Flexible solutions for individuals, developers, and enterprises.
- Accelerating Bitcoin transactions will require an additional approval as well as
  a charge higher fee than a regular Bitcoin transaction.

- inabit chose to partner with Vaultinum.
- Never perform this procedure unless a disaster event has occurred.
- The backup email is set by upgrading an organization's security level via the owner's
  settings.
- Supports multiple assets including ERC-20 and similar standards.
- Supports multiple blockchain standards such as ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20.
- This IP address must be whitelisted otherwise, the connectivity to inabit will fail.

  enable access for inabit services to operate on your behalf.
- 'Make sure you''ve enabled the following API restrictions when generating the keys:
  General, Spot Trading, Transfer'
- Direct transfers to third parties from Kraken are disabled by default.
- Direct transfers to third parties from Kraken are disabled by default. In order
  to transfer funds from your kraken exchange wallet directly to a countryparty, you
  must manually save each destination address in Kraken's UI first.
- The endpoint remains constant no matter what operation you perform.
- Mutations are used to change data on the server.
- API calls require a valid Access Token for authorizing requests.
- Access tokens are valid for 15 hours and will expire afterwards.
- Ensure to handle OAuth2 token expiration properly.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 authentication
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in inabit
- You must have an active account at inabit.com.
- You have received a login token that is related to your 'apiSigner' user.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- During the first run, the pairing process is initiated.
- You will need to get the pairing code from the docker logs.
- Login token is valid for 30 days and is automatically refreshed.
- Ensure the WHITELIST_CSV_PATH environment variable corresponds to the path used
  inside the container.
- 'In that account, there must be 2 existing users, with the following roles: A. apiAdmin
  user. B. apiSigner user.'
- Requires a login token provided by representatives for the apiSigner user.
- Use Docker to run the approver app.
- The external validation endpoint is expected to expose a 'post' http endpoint for
  validation purpose.
- connectivity to the endpoint must be enabled.
- Requires a login token for access.
- Ensure that your server can access api.inabit.com.
- Supports multiple assets and tokens within supported standards like ERC-20.
- The list below is relevant only for inabit native wallets.
- Connectivity to the endpoint must be enabled
- Bitcoin Transactions Acceleration
- Increased support of different countries & currencies for off-ramp.
- Additional security updates in the mobile approvals app.
- Supports multiple assets including ERC-20 and equivalent standards
- Not all blockchains function identically, so we support different features depending
  on the technical constraints of each blockchain.
- Ensure to correctly map the volumes for persistency.
- Connectivity to the endpoint must be enabled.
- The login token is valid for 30 days and is refreshed automatically.
