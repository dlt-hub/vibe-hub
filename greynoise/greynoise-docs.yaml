notes:
- Log in to use your API keys
- Access your API key on your account page
- Users can request access to a 14-day trial of the full version of GreyNoise by filling
  out the Request Enterprise Trial form on the account page.
- GreyNoise alerts can notify an admin if any IP within a specified CIDR block begins
  scanning the internet.
- Requires an active Subscription or Enterprise Trial to Access
- The endpoint will return 1,000 results per page by default.
- The `size` parameter can be used to increase the limit up to 10,000 results per
  page.
- The data that this endpoint queries refreshes once per hour.
- Time-Based Queries are based on UTC Timestamps.
- The GreyNoise feed of indicators provides the last 24 hours of internet scanner
  indicators observed by the GreyNoise sensor network based on their classification.
- RIOT data helps provide context to users around IP addresses tied to common business
  services.
- GreyNoise has no information about this IP.
- 'If an IP is tagged as both Internet Scanner (NOISE): True AND Business Service
  (RIOT): True all of the details presented on this IP address must be considered.'
- Single Sign-On feature is available to all GreyNoise customers with a paid subscription
- Customers should reach out to their dedicated Customer Success Manager to initiate
  SSO setup
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Searches are no longer being measured for most users
- Most paid plans no longer include usage limitations
- Alerts can be configured via the GreyNoise Visualizer.
- Alert delivery can be via email or webhook.
- Feeds are available to Advanced and Elite platform customers with appropriate data
  modules.
- The Timeline only encompasses the past 90 days.
- Data buckets are by the hour.
- Requires a GreyNoise Enterprise API key.
- The server runs locally; requests are proxied from the client to GreyNoise through
  your machine.
- Users are responsible for securing their own API keys
- 'No Data Retention: The MCP server doesn''t persist any data locally'
- Each tag card contains Tag Name, Tag Category, Tag Intent (Benign, Unknown, or Malicious),
  Associated CVEs.
- Most Active tags are the tags that GreyNoise has observed the highest number of
  distinct source IPs for 24h period.
- At the initial launch of this feature, the Block List URLs did not require authentication
  to use. As this feature is now out of BETA, an authorization mechanism will be put
  in place to use this feature.
- The API provides insight into the active exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- Updates happen once per hour.
- GreyNoise wants to make it as easy as possible to integrate into your favorite security
  tools.
- Enter your GreyNoise API key into the Value input
- The Threat types value will contain the indicator classification
- The Tags will include all GreyNoise tags associated with the indicator
- The indicator will be 'valid' for 24h after ingest
- The API key should be obtained from the GreyNoise Visualizer.
- Ensure your subscription includes a Feed license before enabling.
- greynoise_scan_deployment_once and greynoise_scan_deployment savedsearches are used
  for scanning the data indexed in Splunk. So, in case when these saved searches are
  skipped, the data indexed during that interval will not be scanned for Internet
  Scanner and Business Service Intelligence status.
- For those users with Community (Free) API access only, the only action available
  will be the Lookup GreyNoise IP Community Information. All other actions will fail
  with an access denied error.
- The Feed requires an active GreyNoise subscription with Feed access.
- Community API Type with Invalid Key will not be validated.
- Indicator must be of type 'ip-src' or 'ip-dst'
- CVE Lookup Requires Enterprise (Paid) API Access
- The script relies on your GreyNoise API key to be set as an environment variable
  with the key GN_API_KEY
- Must have permission to add Extensions in Recorded Future and access to the GreyNoise
  Enterprise API.
- Beware of GNQL Query Limits
- It is recommended that this be a Daily Feed.
- Ensure the script is set to execute at a regular cadence (at least once per day,
  no more than once per hour).
- A GreyNoise API key with a paid subscription is required.
- Ensure that the appropriate .env file is created with the necessary API credentials
  and information
- The script is set to execute at a regular cadence (at least once per day, no more
  than once per hour)
- Requires an API key for authentication
- Rate limits apply to API usage
- Users must not share their API Key.
- 'Last Updated: 2025-10-08'
- Requires setup of connected app in GreyNoise
- Data is based on purchasing the Investigate Intelligence Module.
- The module provides data about IP addresses and their associated metadata.
- Basic CVE details, including CVSS score, associated products & vendors, and NIST
  CVE recognition status.
- 'Data Dictionary: Intelligence Module - Business Services - Entitlements'
- Entitlements outline the field types associated with the IP endpoint responses.
- The RIOT category identifies the type of service provided.
- Field types associated with the Community IP Lookup Endpoint
- All v2 API endpoints have been deprecated and will be End of Life as of 1-Jan-2026.
- Use the `quick` parameter to return a subset of the response fields, for a faster
  response time.
- The data that this endpoint queries refreshes once per hour
- The metadata endpoint is designed for use cases where you need to retrieve IP intelligence
  data without the raw scan data, making it more efficient for metadata-focused queries.
- This endpoint requires a business email address and appropriate entitlements.
- Supports filtering by name, slug, and CVE.
- Provides a simple endpoint to check GreyNoise status and GreyNoise API access
- Use the quick parameter to return a subset of the response fields, for a faster
  response time.
- This endpoint requires an additional subscription license to use.
- The Community API provides community users with a free tool to query IPs in the
  GreyNoise dataset.
