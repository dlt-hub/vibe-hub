auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/braze.com/1.0.0/openapi.json:
  - 'App Group REST API keys must be passed through the HTTP Authorization header.
    As of April 2020, keys sent in the request body or URL parameters are deprecated
    but continue to work until sunset. The exact header name and format for passing
    the api_key through Authorization should be specified in your Braze API documentation
    (typically "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" or similar).'
  - Braze REST API uses an API key for authentication. The API key should be passed
    as the `api_key` environment variable in Postman, and according to the documentation,
    as of April 2020, API keys are no longer passed in the request body or URL parameters
    but instead through a different method (the documentation appears cut off, but
    implies header-based authentication). Set up your Postman environment with `instance_url`
    and `api_key` variables corresponding to your Braze instance and REST API Key.
  - REST API Key authentication is required and must be provided in the request. A
    401 Unauthorized error is returned if the REST API Key is unknown or missing,
    indicating the key must be included with each request, likely in a standard authorization
    header or as a query parameter.
  - REST API Key authentication is required and must be provided in the request. A
    401 Unauthorized response is returned if the REST API Key is unknown or missing.
    The exact header name and how to pass the key are not specified in this documentation
    excerpt.
