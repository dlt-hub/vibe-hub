  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer Your_API_Key_Here" when making requests to the
    API endpoints.'
- information_source; https://nubela.co/blog/get-a-linkedin-profiles-contact-information/:
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the API key as ''Authorization:
    Bearer {{ API_KEY }}'' in the request headers to authenticate with the Proxycurl
    API.'
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header as 'Bearer {{ API_KEY }}' where {{ API_KEY }} is replaced with your actual
    API key value.
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Send your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}". The API key should be provided
    as an environment variable or configuration value named YOUR_API_KEY.'
- information_source; https://nubela.co/blog/how-to-build-a-linkedin-data-scraper/:
  - Bearer Token authentication is required and should be passed in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token. The token is stored as a variable (e.g., {{Bearer Token}})
    in Postman and must be set in the Authorization tab; if requests return 401, verify
    the token variable is properly saved and inherited by the request.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs.html:
  - Pagination uses next_page_no and next_page_api_url fields in the response to navigate
    forward; previous_page_no and previous_page_api_url for backward navigation. Stop
    paginating when next_page_api_url is null. Use the provided URL directly for the
    next request.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page_size (default and example value
    10) and page (default 1). Response includes company_count field indicating total
    results. Continue paginating by incrementing the page parameter until all results
    are retrieved based on company_count and page_size values.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page_size (default and example value
    10) to control results per request. The response includes a next field containing
    the URL for the next page; continue fetching until next is null or absent to complete
    pagination.
  - The response includes a next_page field containing the API URI for the next page
    of results, or null when there are no more pages. Use the next_page URI to fetch
    subsequent pages of company customer data.
  - Use query parameter page_size to control results per page (optional, default and
    max values not specified). Use query parameter country to filter by country. The
    response structure and pagination navigation fields are not documented in the
    provided text.
