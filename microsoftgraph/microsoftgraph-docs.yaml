notes:
- In order to send from another user, set the 'from' property on the message sent
  to the email address of the user to send from.
- Delta query supports both full synchronization and incremental synchronization.
- Tokens are state tokens that encode parameters from the initial delta query GET
  request.
- To initialize your graphClient, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/create-client?from=snippets&tabs=python
- Delta query supports both full and incremental synchronization.
- State tokens are opaque to the client.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token
- By default, name pronunciation is disabled.
- Changing settings can take up to seven hours to reflect for users.
- Use the least privileged delegated permission, Calendars.Read.Shared for getting
  calendars.
- Use the least privileged delegated permission, Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared for creating
  events.
- Use the least privileged delegated permission, Mail.Read.Shared for reading messages.
- When turning pronouns on or off, it can take up to seven hours for users to see
  changes.
- If pronouns are turned off, any previously set pronouns might stay visible for up
  to seven hours.
- Integration with Outlook calendar assumes an administrator has set up Outlook for
  online meetings. Verify the support before using the API.
- By default, Entra ID is the prioritized source of profile data in an organization.
- The properties and API for calendar sharing and delegating are currently available
  in the v1.0 endpoint.
- Use the least privileged delegated or application permission, Calendars.ReadWrite
  as appropriate, for this operation.
- The properties and API for calendar sharing and delegating as described in this
  topic are currently available in the v1.0 endpoint.
- The properties isShared and isSharedWithMe are exposed in only the beta endpoint.
- The sharing permissions (Calendars.Read.Shared or Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared) allow
  you to read or write events in a shared or delegated calendar.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Operations on the profileCardProperty resource that use delegated permissions require
  the signed-in user to have a Tenant Administrator role.
- Custom properties aren't searchable and can't be used to search for people across
  Microsoft apps and services.
- The calendar API allows setting up online meetings in Outlook calendars.
- Once you enable a meeting online, Microsoft Graph sets the meeting information in
  onlineMeeting.

- Only properties included in $select are tracked for changes.
- Subsequent requests can't be modified.
- This request might have replication delays for users that were recently created,
  updated, or deleted. Retry the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` after some
  time to retrieve the latest changes.
- Changes to user profile photo settings can take up to 24 hours to propagate.

- The time period to look up must be less than 62 days.
- The body of an Outlook message can be either HTML or text, with HTML as the default
  message body type returned in a GET response.
- Immutable identifiers, like all identifiers in Microsoft Graph, are case-sensitive.
- 'To always use immutable IDs, include the header ''Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"''
  with every API request.'
- Access to data through Microsoft Graph APIs might require both Microsoft Graph permissions
  and RBAC permissions.
- Permissions granted through Microsoft Entra built-in roles don't limit the app to
  calling Microsoft Graph APIs only.
- The `members@delta` property is included in group objects by default.
- Always follow `@odata.nextLink` and locally merge each group's state.
- Always follow @odata.nextLink and locally merge each group's state.
- The delta query allows for tracking changes to groups.
- This request might have replication delays for groups that were recently created,
  updated, or deleted. Retry the @odata.nextLink or @odata.deltaLink after some time
  to retrieve the latest changes.
- Don't assume a specific sequence of the responses.
- The delta query allows querying for changes without fetching the entire set of resources.
- Delta query is a per-folder operation.
- Specifying changeType can limit the response to only created, updated, or deleted
  messages.
- Be aware of a known issue if you're attaching large files to a message or event
  in a shared or delegated mailbox.
- The findMeetingTimes action is currently available to Microsoft 365 work or school
  mailboxes, but not personal, outlook.com mailboxes.

  software.
- Proxy authentication isn't supported. If your environment has a proxy that requires
  authentication, we recommend that you allow the connector agent to bypass the proxy.
