pagination_info:
- information_source; https://mediastack.com/documentation:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with limit and offset query parameters. The
    response includes a pagination object with limit (maximum results per request),
    offset (starting position), count (results in current response), and total (total
    available results). Use offset to navigate pages by incrementing it; stop when
    count is less than limit or offset exceeds total.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters limit and offset in
    requests. The response includes pagination>limit (requested page size), pagination>offset
    (current offset), pagination>count (results returned), and pagination>total (total
    available results). To paginate, increment the offset parameter by the limit value
    and resubmit the request until pagination>count is less than pagination>limit
    or offset exceeds pagination>total.
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: limit and offset for request parameters,
    and count (results returned) and total (total available results) in the response.
    Use offset to paginate through results by incrementing it in subsequent requests
    until count is less than limit or offset reaches total.'
