- 'If Userlane fails to meet the response time commitments above, the customer’s exclusive
  remedy and Userlane’s sole obligation will be: (a) for Userlane to make efforts
  to respond promptly after the customer notifies Userlane that it failed to meet
  the relevant response time commitment; and (b) if Userlane fails to meet the relevant
  response time commitments three (3) times during a calendar quarter, for Customer
  to terminate the applicable Order Form and receive a refund, on a pro-rata basis,
  of any Fees paid for the Production Tenant(s) that are unused as of the termination
  effective date.'
