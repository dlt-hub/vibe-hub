auth_info:
- information_source; https://languagelayer.com/documentation:
  - API authentication uses an access_key query parameter. Include access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    in the request URL for GET requests, or as a query parameter in POST requests.
    No other auth headers or mechanisms are mentioned.
  - After signing up, users receive a personal API access key that must be attached
    as a query parameter named access_key to authenticate requests. For example, append
    ?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY to any endpoint URL such as http://api.languagelayer.com/detect.
  - Authentication uses an access_key query parameter. Include access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    as a query parameter in all API requests to the /detect endpoint.
  - The API requires an access_key parameter supplied with each request. Error codes
    indicate that a missing access_key (101) or invalid access_key (101) will be returned
    if credentials are not provided or are incorrect. The access_key should be passed
    as a query parameter in the request URL.
  - The API requires an access_key query parameter for authentication. Pass your access
    key as the access_key parameter in the request URL, for example http://api.languagelayer.com/detect?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY&query=text_to_detect.
    This key must be included in all API requests to the detect, languages, and batch
    endpoints.
