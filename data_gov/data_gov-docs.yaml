auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.data.gov/docs/developer-manual/:
  - API key authentication is required and must be passed to the API. See the API
    key usage documentation for details on how to pass your API key. The API key can
    be missing, invalid, disabled, unauthorized, or unverified, each resulting in
    a 403 HTTP status code. HTTPS is required for all requests.
- information_source; https://api.data.gov/docs/agency-manual/:
  - API Umbrella REST API requires an API key and the X-Admin-Auth-Token header containing
    admin credentials. Requests must be made to https://api.data.gov/api-umbrella/v1/*
    with both the api_key parameter and X-Admin-Auth-Token header supplied for authentication.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass the API key as a query parameter named
    `api_key` in the request URL. The initial API key must be created via the api.data.gov
    admin panel with the `api-umbrella-key-creator` role assigned to enable key creation
    permissions. This key is then used to call the user creation endpoint at `https://api.data.gov/api-umbrella/v1/users.json?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_WITH_KEY_CREATOR_ROLE`
    with POST requests containing user data in JSON format.
  - API keys can be passed either as a GET query string parameter named `api_key`
    or via HTTP headers. The API key will be stripped from analytics logs regardless
    of which method is used, so it will not appear in admin analytics screens even
    if passed in the URL query string.
  - 'The API supports two authentication mechanisms for the X-Api-Key: query parameter
    authentication (ApiKeyQueryAuth) or HTTP header authentication (ApiKeyHeaderAuth).
    Send the API key either as a query parameter or in the X-Api-Key HTTP header.
    For header-based auth in Swagger UI, CORS preflight requests must have API key
    checks disabled and the API must respond with appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    and Access-Control-Allow-Headers response headers.'
