In this guide, we'll set up a complete Katana MRP data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def katana_mrp_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.katanamrp.com/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "manufacturing_order_operation_rows",
            "product_operation_rerank",
            "manufacturing_order_recipe_rows"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='katana_mrp_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='katana_mrp_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(katana_mrp_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from katana_mrp‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Manufacturing Operations: Endpoints related to manufacturing orders, operations, and BOM (Bill of Materials) management.
- Purchase and Sales Operations: Handles operations related to purchase orders, sales orders, and returns.
- Inventory Management: Focuses on batch stocks, price lists, and variant locations.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Katana MRP workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@katana_mrp-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Katana MRP support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:katana_mrp duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Make sure to add the specification file **@katana_mrp-docs.yaml** as context to the chat before prompting
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Katana MRP API, as specified in @katana_mrp-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "manufacturing_order_operation_rows" and "product_operation_rerank" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in katana_mrp_pipeline.py and name the pipeline katana_mrp_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python katana_mrp_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is done using a Bearer token, which must be included in the headers of each API request.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://katanamrp.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python katana_mrp_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline katana_mrp load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset katana_mrp_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/katana_mrp.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline katana_mrp_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("katana_mrp_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "manufacturing_order_operation_rows" table as Pandas frame
   data."manufacturing_order_operation_rows".df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

The API has a rate limit of 60 requests per minute, requires immediate response to webhook notifications, and does not allow updates to closed manufacturing orders. Additionally, there is a cap of 250 records per request, and deprecated endpoints should be avoided.
