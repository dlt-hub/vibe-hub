notes:
- This can be set per-request.
- This is configurable through Flask config.
- JSON support is added to the response, like the request. This is useful when testing
  to get the test client response data as JSON.
- This is especially useful if you want to post-process responses in the main dispatcher
  and use functionality provided by your subclass.
- Keep in mind that this will modify response objects in place if possible!
- This attribute can be assigned to set the header. A list can be assigned to set
  multiple header values. Use `del` to unset the header.
- 'Changed in version 2.3: `WWWAuthenticate` is no longer a `dict`. The `token` attribute
  was added for auth challenges that use a token instead of parameters.'
- 'Changed in version 0.3: category parameter added.'
- 'Changed in version 0.9: category_filter parameter added.'
- This server is for development purposes only. It does not provide the stability,
  security, or performance of production WSGI servers.
- Database initialized with `flask --app flaskr init-db` command.
- Uses WSGI server for running applications
- Blueprints provide separation at the Flask level, share application config.
- Async is not inherently faster than sync code.
- Flask’s async support is less performant than async-first frameworks.
- cookie expires after 10 minutes
- Tests are typically located in the tests folder.
- Use pytest framework to set up and run tests.
- Uses pytest framework for testing.
- Applications fail, servers fail. Sooner or later you will see an exception in production.
- By default if your application runs in production mode, and an exception is raised
  Flask will display a very simple page for you and log the exception.
- The debugger allows executing arbitrary Python code from the browser. It is protected
  by a pin, but still represents a major security risk. Do not run the development
  server or debugger in a production environment.
- 'Autoescaping is no longer enabled for all templates. The following extensions for
  templates trigger autoescaping: .html, .htm, .xml, .xhtml.'
- The server is only accessible from your own computer by default.
- To make the server publicly available, add --host=0.0.0.0 to the command line.
- The authentication blueprint will have views to register new users and to log in
  and log out.
- Ensure the server is running before accessing the registration endpoint.
- Validation occurs on the server even if client-side validation is present.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- The context is unique to each thread (or other worker type).
- teardown functions are called after the context with block exits
- Some of the objects provided by Flask are proxies to other objects.
- Most of the time you don’t have to care about that, but there are some exceptions
  where it is good to know that this object is actually a proxy.
- Setup must be completed before serving the application.
- It is usually not a good idea to return file data in a JSON response.
- JSON cannot represent binary data directly, so it must be base64 encoded.
- Applications need some kind of configuration.
- Configuration values are available when the application starts up.
- The instance folder is designed to not be under version control and be deployment
  specific.
- 'If the instance_path parameter is not provided the following default locations
  are used: Uninstalled module, Uninstalled package, Installed module or package.'
- Do not enable debug mode when deploying in production.
- The prefix is FLASK_ by default.
- Environment variable keys are always uppercase on Windows.
