notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Identifies Sensitive Data: Automatically flags personally identifiable information
  (PII) and other sensitive data.'
- 'Ensures GDPR, CCPA, and PCI Compliance: Highlights any violations, enabling teams
  to remediate issues proactively and avoid regulatory penalties.'
- 'Provides Detailed Audit Logs: Maintains records of API activities to support compliance
  audits and ensure transparency.'
- Sensitive information, including API keys, access tokens, and refresh tokens, was
  leaked from 30,000 public workspaces.
- Postman’s focus on collaboration led to sensitive data being shared indiscriminately,
  increasing unauthorized access risks.
- Workspaces were often set to 'public' instead of 'private,' exposing data to search
  engines and external users.
- Postman, by default, saved sensitive data in a plain text format without any encryption.
- Security demands more than checklists and hope.
- Requires proper setup of OAuth2 for access.
- Rate limits may apply to API calls.
- Keep your focus on building and delivering amazing API and AI Innovations while
  we automatically generate your API docs.
- API authentication is critical to your application's overall security posture.
- Use a well-established authentication framework.
- Implement two-factor authentication.
- Use HTTPS.
- 'Use HTTPS: HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt and store data that''s transmitted over
  the internet.'
- 'Implement rate limiting and throttling: Rate limits are quotas that restrict the
  number of requests a client can make to an API within a certain period of time.'
- 'Validate and sanitize all input parameters, headers, and payloads: Input validation
  is the process of confirming that any data that''s sent to the API follows the expected
  format and constraints.'
- 'Monitor your APIs for suspicious activity: Security monitoring involves continuously
  monitoring API telemetry data to detect security threats and breaches as soon as
  they occur.'
- 'Implement role-based access control: Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to
  control access to an API''s resources according to the roles of authenticated users.'
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Unauthorized users could hijack user sessions to directly access systems.
- Attackers can use exposed API keys to deploy malicious code or exfiltrate sensitive
  data.
- '400 Bad Request: Check request parameters.'
- '401 Unauthorized: Verify token and permissions.'
- '429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded.'
- 'Brute-force attacks: In a brute force attack, the bad actor programmatically guesses
  a password, encryption key, or other authentication credential.'
- 'Denial-of-service attacks: In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, the attacker floods
  the API with a high volume of requests.'
- 'Injection attacks: This type of attack occurs when APIs fail to sanitize input
  parameters and payloads.'
- 'Man-in-the-middle attacks: In this scenario, an attacker is able to alter or inject
  new data into the communication stream.'
