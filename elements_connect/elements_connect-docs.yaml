auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc.elements-apps.com/elements-connect-cloud/rest-api:
  - 'Elements Connect REST API supports OAuth 2.0 with two grant types: Authorization
    Code flow for user-level authentication (used with services like Salesforce, Google
    APIs, Microsoft Graph, GitHub, Dropbox) and Client Credentials flow for application-level
    access without refresh token support. The Authorization Code flow redirects users
    to an authorization server for login and consent, then exchanges an authorization
    code for an access token. Client Credentials flow requires the client to request
    a new access token when the previous one expires since refresh tokens are not
    supported.'
  - 'Elements Connect supports multiple authentication modes: No auth, Basic auth,
    API Key, OAuth 2 Client credentials, and OAuth 2 Authorization Code. For Basic
    auth, provide username and password which are base64-encoded and sent as Authorization
    header in format "Basic <base64(username:password)>". For API Key, specify the
    key name and value to be sent either as a request header or query parameter, and
    Elements Connect will add it to every call.'
  - This documentation describes OAuth2 authorization code grant flow. The app receives
    an authorization code from the server after user approval, exchanges it for an
    access token (and optionally a refresh token) at the authorization server, then
    includes the access token in requests to access protected resources. Refresh tokens
    are automatically renewed by Elements Connect when supported by the service, or
    manually refreshed by a Jira admin if automatic renewal is not available.
- information_source; https://doc.elements-apps.com/elements-connect/oauth2-client-credentials:
  - OAuth2 Client Credentials flow is used for server-to-server machine authentication.
    The application must authenticate to the /token endpoint using client_id and client_secret
    to obtain an access token, which is then used for subsequent API requests.
  - OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type is used to authenticate with Okta's REST
    API. The flow requires registering Elements Connect as an application, obtaining
    a Client ID and Client secret, then configuring the datasource with OAuth2 Client
    Credentials authentication type. No refresh tokens are supported; new access tokens
    are requested when the previous one expires. Required configuration fields include
    Client ID, Client secret, and granted scopes for access level control.
