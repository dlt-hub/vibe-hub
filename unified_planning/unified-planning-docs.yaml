notes:
- Currently supported compilation kinds include GROUNDING, CONDITIONAL_EFFECTS_REMOVING,
  DISJUNCTIVE_CONDITIONS_REMOVING, NEGATIVE_CONDITIONS_REMOVING, QUANTIFIERS_REMOVING,
  TRAJECTORY_CONSTRAINTS_REMOVING, USERTYPE_FLUENTS_REMOVING, BOUNDED_TYPES_REMOVING,
  STATE_INVARIANTS_REMOVING.
- The library allows the specification of classical, numerical, and temporal planning
  problems.
- A single instance of Factory is needed for each environment and can be retrieved
  by the factory property of an Environment object.
- User can set a custom preference list and add external engines to the library by
  creating a configuration file called either up.ini or .up.ini.
- Inherits from unified_planning.engines.Engine and mixins.OneshotPlannerMixin
- Supports numeric planning with various conditions and effects
- Uses Unified-Planning library for creating and solving planning problems.
- Tamer offers the capability to generate a plan for classical, numerical and temporal
  problems.
- For those kind of problems tamer also offers the possibility of validating a submitted
  plan.
- This API uses Java and Python libraries for planning problems.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The value of the metrics can be plotted
- 'To disable printing of planning engine credits, add this line to your code: `up.shortcuts.get_environment().credits_stream
  = None`'
- Currently, the only solver supporting scheduling problems is Aries.
- This will not run in docker or on Colab since up-spiderplan requires docker.
- MAPDDLWriter allows dumping a unified_planning MultiAgentProblem to ma-pddl format.
- Expressiveness in problem modeling comes at a cost and can slow down the planning
  process.
- The operation mode employed for this use case is One Shot Planning.
- The Aries Planning Engine is used to devise optimal plans for the various experiments.
- 'Know the available planning engines: Building a valid problem in UP does not guarantee
  that the problem can be solved by one or more of the available planning engines.'
- 'Simple is better: Reducing the amount of problem actions might improve the planning
  performance.'
- 'Custom heuristics: For some problems it can be helpful to use custom heuristics
  in order to speed up the planning time.'
- 'Creates an expression of the form: left < right.'
- 'Creates an expression of the form: left > right.'
- 'Creates an expression of the form: left == right.'
- This is an agent class that represents a generic agent.
errors:
- 'No plan found: Check problem definition or planner configuration.'
- 'Log Error: result'
- 'status: SOLVED_OPTIMALLY: Indicates optimal solution found.'
