notes:
- S3 credentials consist of an access key, secret key, and endpoint.
- Bucket Logging is available upon request.
- S3 compatible API requires access key and secret key for authentication.
- Users must have an active Storj account and a bucket for Starfish in their Storj
  account.
- Storj is private by design and secure by default—delivering unparalleled data protection
  and privacy when compared to traditional centralized cloud object storage alternatives.
- Developers can use the Satellite Admin Console web interface or the `share` command
  with one either our CLI or developer library/SDK to abstract all the complexity
  of granular access management via client-side delegated authorization.
errors:
- 'InvalidAccessKeyId: The specified access key does not exist.'
- 'SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature does not match the expected signature.'
