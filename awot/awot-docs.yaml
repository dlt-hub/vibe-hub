notes:
- Router is an isolated instance of middleware and routes.
- You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware
  and routing functions.
- Responds with 'Hello World!' for requests to the root URL
- For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found
- Set your wifi credentials to the WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD definitions.
