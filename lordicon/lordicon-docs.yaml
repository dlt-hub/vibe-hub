auth_info:
- information_source; https://lordicon.com/docs/api/documentation:
  - Authentication for the Lordicon API uses an authentication token that is provided
    when you create a project in your account. The token is used for secure communication
    with the Lordicon server and must be included in requests to authenticate your
    project. The specific header name, parameter name, or request format for submitting
    this token is not detailed in the provided documentation.
  - Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YourAuthenticationToken" for requests to endpoints like POST
    /v1/download/track and GET /v1/download/stats.
  - 'Authorization: Bearer token is required. Send the authentication token in the
    Authorization header of the request as "Bearer YourAuthenticationToken".'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send your authentication token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer YourAuthenticationToken" for all API requests
    to api.lordicon.com.

    token received upon application creation. Include the token as Authorization:
    Bearer YourAuthenticationToken in the request header. Rate limits are enforced
    and indicated via X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset
    response headers; exceeding limits returns HTTP 429.'
