auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/index.html:
  - Basic authentication is supported via the Authorization header using the format
    Basic Base64("username:password"). Additionally, if two-factor authentication
    is enabled, a Token header with a numeric value (e.g., 123456) must be included
    in requests.
  - HTTP Basic Authorization is required. Requests must include an Authorization header
    with a Base64 encoded hash of "username:password". For two-factor authentication,
    supply an additional Token request header with the authentication token.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/index.html:
  - Pagination uses Link headers with "next", "previous", "first", and "last" relations
    to navigate pages. All required parameters for moving to the next page are included
    in the link href. Requests outside page boundaries return 404. The API does not
    provide stateful cursors; records may change between page requests.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer >= 0, default 0, zero-based index)
    and size (integer >= 1, default 10, records per page). The response structure
    is not shown, but page and size control which page of results to retrieve.
- information_source; https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/api-v3.json:
  - Pagination uses link-based navigation with "next", "previous", "first", and "last"
    links provided in the response. All parameters required to move to the next page
    are included in the href of the "next" link, allowing natural movement through
    pages. Requests outside page boundaries return 404 NOT FOUND. The API does not
    provide stateful cursors and does not guarantee read consistency across pages.
  - Pagination uses page (query parameter, zero-based index, optional, default 0,
    minimum 0) and size (query parameter, optional, default 10, minimum 1) to request
    pages. The response schema is PagedModelAsset, which contains the paginated results
    and navigation information.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (zero-based index, optional, default 0,
    minimum 0) and size (records per page, optional, default 10, minimum 1). Response
    returns PagedModelAsset schema containing paginated results; stop when reaching
    the last page based on the response structure.
