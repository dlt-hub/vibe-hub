notes:
- Propolis is a plant derived product that bees produce from resins and beeswax.
- Chemical composition varies by geographic location and local flora.
- Propolis consists of plant resins and beeswax.
- Chemical analysis indicates the plant(s) that bees have visited.
- NMR represents a very powerful tool for the study of propolis.
- The best results are normally obtained using the 1H NMR which is the simplest and
  fastest technique.
- Direct observation of resin forager behavior in the field can be extremely difficult
  or impossible
- Resins from most species remain uncharacterized and characterization itself is a
  very labor intensive process
- Spectrophotometric methods are very useful for fast and easy quantitative determination
  of phenolic compounds in propolis.
- Selecting permissions does not provide access to the full text of the article
- Data available on request from the authors.
- The BDC-WE is still a prototype and the openEO Backend developed still does not
  support all functions of the openEO standard.
- Developers can customize the template project to meet the specific needs of an application.
- The openEO API is used as a way of exposing processing services to clients.
- Developed as a QGIS plugin and a Python program
- Allows for plug-and-play addition of new data sources
- The framework retrieves requested data by generating, debugging, and executing programs
  based on natural language queries.
- The data is structured using nodes, ways, and relations.
- Downloading data can be challenging due to complex data structure.
- No API keys or accounts are required for satellite imagery access.
- The agent uses geocoding service provided by nominatim.org to retrieve boundaries.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Data may be subject to change based on new reports
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses EnergyPlus and Modelica for control evaluation.
- Testing environments with hardware-in-the-loop are limited in scalability.
- Framework aims to benchmark control algorithms for building performance evaluation.
- Emulator models for different building types should be available.
- Lexcube for Jupyter significantly reduces data processing and visualization times
  compared to existing tools, facilitating real-time data exploration.
- Integration into the Jupyter notebook environment
- Uses native Jupyter widget elements such as buttons and sliders
- The language selected may not be comprehensive of every culture and geographic region/locale.
- Many TGD people have experienced stigma, discrimination, and mistreatment in health
  care settings.
- Health care systems should provide medically necessary gender-affirming health care
  for transgender and gender diverse people.
- Recommendations should meet the needs of local transgender and gender diverse communities.
- We recommend health care professionals and other users of the Standards of Care,
  Version 8 (SOC-8) apply the recommendations in ways that meet the needs of local
  transgender and gender diverse communities, by providing culturally sensitive care
  that recognizes the realities of the countries they are practicing in.
- Focus on studies that appeared in press in 2009 or later
- Use clear definitions of TGD status
- Calculate proportions based on well-defined population denominator
- Greater understanding and research are needed on the intersection of health education
  systems, licensure, and transgender health across the world.
- Cultural competency related to TGD communities continues to be lacking.
- Evidence base indicates a general improvement in the lives of transgender adolescents
  receiving gender-affirming medical treatment.
- Rates of reported regret during the study monitoring periods are low.
- Adolescents are typically dependent on their caregivers/parents for guidance in
  numerous ways.
- No set of guidelines can account for every set of individual circumstances on a
  global scale.
- A letter of assessment from a member of the multidisciplinary team is needed for
  recommending gender-affirming treatment.
- Engaging in discussions with families about future unknowns related to surgical
  and sexual health outcomes.
- A period of hormone treatment may need to be longer for sufficient surgical results.
- HCPs of all disciplines should avoid stereotyping based on preconceived ideas that
  may be incorrect or biased.
- Continuing professional development regarding gender diverse children and families
