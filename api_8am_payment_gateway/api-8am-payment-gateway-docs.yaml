notes:
- All parameter values included in a request must be in plain text format. This API
  doesn't accept encoded values.
- Merchants can provide an optional surcharge_amount element to a charge request.
- Credits must be enabled by 8am on a per-account basis.
- A Merchant may retrieve an existing recurring charge by sending a GET request to
  /v1/recurring/charges/{id}.
- The API supports pagination over the result set.
- Occurrences are returned in descending order of their creation.
- The maximum page size for results is 100.
- CORS is allowed for calls to the /v1/tokens endpoint, but it will cause errors when
  used in association with any other API endpoint.
- Events don't contain any sensitive payment details, but may contain personally identifiable
  information.
- The API supports pagination over the result set by allowing the client to specify
  the number of results per logical 'page' and the page to view.
- The page number starts at 1.
- The default page size is 20.
- The Payment Portal REST API only accepts encrypted communications using HTTPS.
- Requests are standard REST calls made to the Payment Portal API URL.
- OAuth is required for all integrations.
- Configure a webhook to confirm provisioning.
- Use test mode until you’re ready to process live merchant applications.
- The redirect URI must be handled by your web server.
- Disconnecting a merchant revokes authorization to use a partner OAuth application
  from the specified 8am merchant account.
- You need your public key, secret keys, and account ID to create a charge.
- This type of integration requires a partner OAuth application.
- The access_token is for a specific 8am merchant.
- The maximum value for amount is 10^14 - 1.
- If test mode is true, transactions won’t actually be submitted.
- Hosted Fields protect your payment page by tokenizing payment information.
- The merchant’s public key is required to tokenize payment details on behalf of the
  merchant.
- Before a merchant can take eCheck payments in your application, they must be eCheck-enabled.
- Using test-mode secret key allows for immediate API usage without submitting actual
  charges.
- This integration works with Card Vault and requires a partner OAuth application.
- An InfoRequest must have a Contact associated with it.
- For the saved payment method to be displayed in Card Vault, the Contact must have
  a tag called 'default'.
- Updates may appear in Hosted Fields at any time. Bookmark this page and check back
  often to learn about the latest updates.
- To create a test invoice, provide bank_account_id, contact_id, and set test_mode
  to true.
- Pre-populating fields like amount and reference is recommended.
- You must have an 8am payment integration.
- Your users must have both your mobile app and the target app installed.
- OAuth 2.0 authorization is required to perform transactions on behalf of customers.
- Always use 8am’s hosted field JavaScript library to tokenize payment details without
  having that data pass through your servers.
- The events you receive aren’t batched or sequenced.
- Anyone can send data to the URL configured for your webhook.
- Data can be lost if your system doesn’t respond with a 200 OK message before the
  maximum number of retries.
- Merchant and payment gateway API requests are authenticated using HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Always base64-encode the public or secret key plus a trailing colon.
- If you’d like to report a security vulnerability, discuss confidential customer
  information, or migrate customer data to 8am, you can use our PGP key to encrypt
  your communications.
- Requires setup of connected app for OAuth2
- API may return nulls for certain fields in nested structures
- All requests must be made over HTTPS.
- Test-mode and live-mode keys must not be mixed.
- Creating a payment form with hosted fields is required to tokenize payment details.
- Successful authorizations are captured automatically daily.
- If a bank account has more than one of the same type, the first one is returned.
- 'Charges created with auto_capture: true are captured automatically.'
- The Credit API is disabled by default and must be enabled by 8am on a per-account
  basis.
- A recurring charge cannot be scheduled to start on the same day it is created.
- A Merchant may retrieve an existing recurring charge by sending a GET request.
- When updating sensitive data, always PATCH with a new payment token.
- The API supports pagination with a maximum of 100 results per page.
- Events don't contain any sensitive payment details, but they may contain personally
  identifiable information like customer names and addresses.
- By default the Events are returned in reverse chronological order.
- Start date-based retrieval is intended to simplify synchronization of Gateway state
  with external systems.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requests made over unsecured HTTP communications are not accepted.
- Creates an Invoice using the properties included in the request.
- If you are creating an invoice for test purposes, set test_mode to true.
- Use hosted fields to create your payment form for security reasons.
