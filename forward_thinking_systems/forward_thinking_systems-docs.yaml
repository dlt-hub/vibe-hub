auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.ftsgps.com/support/rest-api-quick-start-guide/:
  - Customers must request API access from Forward Thinking Systems Support and provide
    their static IP address(es), desired API(s), and facilities/groups for access.
    Authentication uses Bearer tokens generated via the REST API that expire after
    one hour and must be regenerated to continue making API calls.
  - POST to /authentication/token endpoint with your credentials to generate an access
    token, then use that token to authorize subsequent API calls (typically via Authorization
    header). The API is protected by a Web Application Firewall with rate limiting
    on all endpoints; 429 errors indicate rate limit violations.
