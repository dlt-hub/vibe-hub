auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/:
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with API credentials. Send requests with
    the Authorization header using the format `-u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"`,
    which encodes the username and token as base64 in the Authorization header. Program
    Member permissions are required for accessing private program resources; insufficient
    permissions result in a 403 Forbidden response.
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with credentials passed as a username
    and token pair in the Authorization header. Send requests with the `-u` flag using
    format `<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>`, which encodes to the Authorization
    header as `Basic base64(username:token)`.
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with credentials passed as username and
    token. Send your API username and token as the auth parameter in requests, formatted
    as username:token (e.g., in Python using requests.auth tuple or curl -u flag).
    The credentials are YOUR_API_USERNAME and YOUR_API_TOKEN.
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with credentials passed via the -u flag.
    Send your API username and token as "YOUR_API_USERNAME:YOUR_API_TOKEN" in the
    Authorization header (or use curl's -u parameter). The endpoint also requires
    "Program Management" permission; insufficient permissions return a 403 Forbidden
    response.
  - API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with username and token credentials. Send
    the username and token as base64-encoded credentials in the Authorization header
    using the format username:token, or use the -u flag in curl with the format "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>".
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based pagination with page[number] and page[size] query
    parameters. The response includes links.first and links.next URLs for navigation,
    with a maximum of 100 results per page. Construct subsequent requests using the
    next link URL until no next link is present.
  - Pagination uses page[number] (query parameter, optional) to specify which page
    to retrieve and page[size] (query parameter, optional) to specify the number of
    objects per page. The response includes paginated asset tag objects.
  - Pagination uses page[number] query parameter (e.g., page[number]=1, page[number]=2).
    Response includes links.self, links.next, and links.last with full URLs for navigating
    pages; construct subsequent requests using the next link URL until no next link
    is present.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page[number] (optional, page to retrieve) and
    page[size] (optional, number of objects per page). Response structure for pagination
    fields/navigation is not documented in this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page[number] (optional, page to retrieve) and
    page[size] (optional, number of objects per page). The response contains paginated
    credentials objects; however, specific response fields indicating navigation (such
    as next, has_more, or total) are not detailed in this documentation excerpt.
