auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.surveysensum.com/:
  - Access token contains permissions that determine which services and operations
    you can access. Permissions are managed in the Surveysensum portal and map to
    specific API operations such as viewing or managing surveys, contact lists, contacts,
    email templates, and shares. The access token is validated on each request; a
    401 Unauthorized response indicates a bad or missing token, and a 403 Forbidden
    response indicates insufficient permissions for the requested operation.
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header ''Authorization: Bearer "token"'' in all API requests, where "token"
    is your authentication token.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header ''Authorization: Bearer "token"'' with your actual token value for
    all API requests to the SurveySensum API.'
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token. Include the header ''Authorization: Bearer
    {token}'' in requests to the SurveyMetaData endpoint. The token value must be
    provided by the API service.'
  - 'Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header `Authorization: Bearer {token}` where {token} is your authentication
    token.'

    for pagination. pageIndex specifies the zero-based page number and pageSize specifies
    the number of results per page (example shows pageSize=10). The response structure
