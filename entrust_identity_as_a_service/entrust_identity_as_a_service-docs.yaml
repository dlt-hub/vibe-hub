  : - An Admin API application must be created with an Application ID and Shared Secret.
      These credentials are submitted in the request body to authenticate and obtain
      an authToken, which must then be included in all subsequent Admin API requests.
      The authToken has an expiration time and is returned in the authentication response.
    - 'An Authorization header is required, containing a token value obtained from
      an authentication request. The token can be sent with the "Bearer" prefix (e.g.,
      "Authorization: Bearer <token>") or without it (e.g., "Authorization: <token>").
      Both formats are accepted.'
    - 'Authorization header is required and must contain a token value obtained from
      authentication. The token can be sent as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" or
      "Authorization: <token>". The token is passed in the Authorization header of
      the request.'
    - 'To authenticate with the Admin API, submit a POST request to the authentication
      endpoint with a JSON body containing applicationId and sharedSecret. The response
      returns an authToken that must be included in all subsequent Admin API requests.


      **Authentication endpoint:** https://<domainname>.<region>.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/adminapi/authenticate


      **Request body (JSON):** applicationId and sharedSecret fields


      **Response:** authToken field in JSON response


      **Usage:** Include the authToken value in subsequent Admin API calls (exact
      header/parameter name for token inclusion is not specified in this excerpt).'
    - You must execute an Authentication (Admin API) call before any other Admin API
      calls. This call generates a token value that must be included in every other
      request to be successful.
