  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Use the Authorization header with the
    value "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of "Client ID:Client secret".
    For example, with Client ID "Aladdin" and Client secret "open sesame", the header
    would be "Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==". Most HTTP libraries
    provide built-in support for basic authentication.'
  - HTTP basic access authentication is required. Provide an Authorization header
    with the value "Basic " followed by base64-encoded credentials in the format "Client
    ID:Client secret". The Client ID and Client secret are provided by InfoJobs and
    must be base64 encoded together as a single string separated by a colon.
- information_source; https://developer.infojobs.net/documentation/operation-list/index.xhtml:
  - In order to use InfoJobs API operations you must provide developer credentials
    issued when you registered your app. Some operations also require user authorization
    through OAuth2 specification. Refer to the app authentication and user OAuth2
    documentation pages for specific header names, parameter names, and token acquisition
    details.
- information_source; https://developer.infojobs.net/documentation/user-oauth2/index.xhtml:
  - 'Authentication uses a combined Basic auth and Bearer token scheme sent in a single
    Authorization header. The header format is "Authorization: Basic [base64-encoded-credentials],Bearer
    [access-token]" where the Basic portion contains client credentials (base64 encoded)
    and the Bearer portion contains a plain-text access token. Each API operation
    specifies required scopes and user roles in its documentation.'
  - 'InfoJobs uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Redirect users to https://www.infojobs.net/api/oauth/user-authorize/index.xhtml
    with query parameters: scope (comma-separated list of required scopes), client_id
    (your application ID), redirect_uri (your callback URL), response_type=code, and
    optional state (for CSRF protection). Users authenticate with their InfoJobs credentials
    and grant permission for specified scopes.'
