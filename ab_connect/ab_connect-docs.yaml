auth_info:
- information_source; https://abconnect.docs.apiary.io/:
  - 'AB Connect API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Credentials include
    a partner ID and partner key provided by AB. The signature is computed as base64-encoded
    HMAC-SHA256 of a message containing Unix timestamp (expires) and optional user
    ID, separated by newline. Send authentication via query parameters: partner.id
    (partner ID), auth.signature (computed signature), and optionally user.id (partner-defined
    string for access control).'
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based requests. Credentials are passed
    as query parameters: partner.id (partner identifier), auth.signature (HMAC-SHA256
    hash of message in base64), auth.expires (expiration timestamp), and optionally
    user.id (user identifier). The signature is computed by HMAC-SHA256 hashing a
    message string using a partner key, then base64-encoding the result. All parameters
    are URL-encoded and appended to the request URL as query string parameters.'
  - 'Authentication uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based scheme. Credentials include partner
    ID and partner key provided by AB. The signature is computed from a message containing
    auth expiration timestamp (seconds since epoch), optional user ID, and HTTP method
    (e.g., "GET"), then base64-encoded and URL-encoded. Send as query parameters:
    partner.id, partner.auth_expires, partner.user_id (optional), and partner.signature.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://abconnect.docs.apiary.io/:
  - AB Connect uses limit and offset pagination. The limit parameter (query string,
    optional, defaults to 10, capped at 100 maximum) controls page size. The offset
    parameter (query string) specifies the starting position. Response includes links
    object with next, previous, first, and last URLs for navigation; stop paginating
    when next link is absent.
  - AB Connect v4.1 uses offset-based pagination with `limit` and `offset` query parameters.
    The `limit` parameter sets page size (default 10, capped at 100 maximum), and
    `offset` parameter specifies the starting position in the result set. Facet data
    does not support paging. When requesting facets with over 10,000 values, only
    the first 10,000 are returned.
  - Pagination uses an offset-based scheme with a query parameter offset. The response
    includes links object with next and last fields containing full URLs for subsequent
    pages. Stop paginating when the next link is absent.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, default/example 25) and offset (query
    parameter, default 0) to control page size and starting position. Response includes
    links object with next/self URLs and meta object containing offset, limit, and
    count fields; construct next request using the next URL or increment offset by
    limit until offset reaches or exceeds total count.
  - Pagination uses offset-based navigation with query parameters. Request parameter
    limit (optional, controls page size) and offset (optional, default 0) control
    pagination. Response includes links object with first, prev, self, next, and last
    URLs that automatically reflect the current limit and offset values. Navigate
    pages by following the provided link URLs.
