auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.gravityflow.io/outgoing-webhook-step-type/:
  - "Gravity Flow's outgoing webhook step supports three authentication types: None\
    \ for unauthenticated requests, Basic which encodes a provided username and password\
    \ into the authorization header, and Connected App which uses OAuth1 credentials\
    \ configured separately under Workflow \u2192 Settings \u2192 Connected Apps.\
    \ Additional HTTP headers can be manually specified as needed, with the system\
    \ automatically providing the authorization header for Basic auth and Content-Type\
    \ header for JSON POST requests."
