notes:
- Customers are responsible for setting and maintaining vendor access controls.
- SOAP Authentication is Changing to OAuth 2.0
- SymXchange uses XML and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) files with SOAP
  (Simple Object Access Protocol) specifications to implement web services over client-
  and third-party-system networks.
- Create exceptional banking experiences using Jack Henry's Digital Toolkit.
- Security enhancements announced for jXchange SOAP APIs.
- The Federal Reserve has announced a change to the implementation date for the transition
  to ISO. The adoption date of the new ISO standard is now set for July 14, 2025.
- Transitioning to OAuth 2.0 requires migration from the old SOAP WS-Security Model.
- Beginning on May 1st, 2025, JH is enhancing jXchange SOAP API security by transitioning
  to OAuth 2.0 instead of username and password pair.
