  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters in query string or request body. Request
    parameters: page (optional, defaults to 1). Response includes meta object with
    total count, current page number, next_page, previous_page, first_page, and last_page
    boolean flags to determine pagination state and construct subsequent requests.'
  - 'Pagination uses page-based navigation with query parameters. Request parameter
    page (optional, defaults to 1) specifies the page number. Response includes meta
    fields: total (total records), page (current page), next_page (next page number
    or null), previous_page (previous page number or null), first_page (boolean),
    and last_page (boolean). Stop paginating when last_page is true or next_page is
    null.'
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: first_page (boolean indicating if current
    page is first), last_page (boolean indicating if current page is last), and next_page
    (cursor value for retrieving next page). Use the next_page value in subsequent
    requests to paginate through results; stop when last_page is true.'
  - Use query parameters page (optional, which result page) and per_page (optional,
    number of results per page) to paginate. The documentation shows these parameters
    for both GET /lists and GET /lists/{id}/contacts endpoints, but does not specify
    default values, maximum limits, or response fields indicating pagination state.
