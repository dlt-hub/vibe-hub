auth_info:
- information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/chains/opbnb:
  - API requests require an API key passed as a query parameter named `key`. The API
    key can be provided either as a URL query parameter (e.g., `?key=API_KEY`) in
    REST calls or directly to the SDK client constructor (e.g., `new GoldRushClient("API_KEY")`).
- information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/chains/overview:
  - The API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named `key` in the URL.
    For example, include `?key=API_KEY` in your request to authenticate with the Covalent
    API.
- information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/goldrush-foundational-api/authentication:
  - GoldRush API uses Basic Authentication with the API key as the username. Register
    for an API key at goldrush.dev/platform/auth/register/, then supply it as the
    Basic Auth username (no password required) in direct HTTP requests, or initialize
    the GoldRushClient SDK with the API key string passed to the constructor as "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE".
  - 'GoldRush Foundational API requires authentication via an API key obtained from
    the GoldRush Platform. The API key must be supplied with each request to access
    protected endpoints.


    To obtain an API key, register at https://goldrush.dev/platform/auth/register/.
    The key is then supplied either through SDK usage or direct API calls by including
    it in requests. Specific details on how to supply the key (header name, parameter
    name, or other method) are referenced in the "Supplying the API Key" section,
    but those exact technical details are not provided in this excerpt.'
  - 'The API supports three authentication methods: Basic Authentication using your
    API key with a trailing colon (e.g., `-u YOUR_API_KEY_HERE:`), Bearer token authentication
    via the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` header, or query parameter authentication
    using the `key` parameter in the URL. Basic Authentication is recommended for
    direct API calls over the other methods.'
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/api-reference/foundational-api/transactions/get-earliest-transactions-for-address-v3
  : - The response includes pagination links in a "links" object with "prev" and "next"
      string fields containing URLs for navigating to previous and next pages of transactions.
      Use the "next" URL to fetch subsequent pages until it returns null or empty.
- ? information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/api-reference/foundational-api/transactions/get-paginated-transactions-for-address-v3
  : - Use path parameter `page` to request specific pages. Response includes `current_page`
      field and `links` object with `prev` and `next` URL strings for navigation.
      Stop when `next` is null.
    - Use the path parameter page to request specific pages of transactions. The endpoint
      follows a paginated URL structure where you increment the page number in the
      path to retrieve subsequent pages of results.
- ? information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/api-reference/foundational-api/transactions/get-time-bucket-transactions-for-address-v3
  : - The API uses time bucket-based pagination with prev and next links in the response.
      Use the next link value to fetch the subsequent time bucket's transactions,
      and prev to go backwards. Stop when next is null or complete is true.
- ? information_source; https://goldrush.dev/docs/api-reference/foundational-api/transactions/get-all-transactions-in-a-block-by-page
  : - Pagination uses a path parameter page in the URL endpoint. The response includes
      links.prev and links.next fields containing URLs for navigating to previous
      and next pages respectively.
