  - 'The Stack Exchange API uses OAuth 2.0 for user authentication with two flows:
    authorization grant (server-side) and implicit (browser-based). For the authorization
    grant flow, redirect users to https://stackoverflow.com/oauth with query parameters
    client_id, scope, redirect_uri, and optional state. After user approval, they
    are redirected to your redirect_uri with code and optional state parameters. Then
    POST to https://stackoverflow.com/oauth/access_token with application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    body containing client_id, client_secret, code, and redirect_uri to receive an
    access_token response (optionally as JSON by POSTing to https://stackoverflow.com/oauth/access_token/json
    instead). The access_token is returned in the form access_token=...&expires=1234,
    where expires is only set if scope does not include no_expiry.'
