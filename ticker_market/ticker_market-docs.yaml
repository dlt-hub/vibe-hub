auth_info:
- information_source; https://tickermarket.com/assets/html/api/apiEndPoint.html:
  - A temporary JWT Token is created during login and must be passed in the Authorization
    header for subsequent API calls.
  - The API uses JWT token-based authentication. A temporary JWT token is obtained
    from the Login endpoint at `/API/V1/Users/Login`, and this token must be passed
    in the Authorization header when calling subsequent endpoints like `/API/V1/Data/BseEquity`.
    The Authorization header should contain the JWT token as the API access key.
- information_source; https://tickermarket.com/assets/html/api/introduction.html:
  - This REST API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Users must first authenticate
    via a POST API call to obtain a valid JSON Web Token, which is then required to
    access all subsequent API endpoints. Only requests with a valid token are permitted.
- information_source; https://tickermarket.com/assets/html/api/production/dataServices_mcx.html:
  - 'The API uses two authentication methods: First, username and password credentials
    are sent in a JSON request body to a /Users/Login endpoint to obtain a token.
    Second, subsequent API requests use the Bearer token scheme, where the token is
    sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>". The token
    appears to be a JWT (JSON Web Token) based on its structure.'
