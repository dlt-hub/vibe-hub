auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.olx.bg/api/doc:
  - Access token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header (typically as "Bearer {access_token}") to authenticate requests to the
    OLX Partner API.
  - "Access token based authentication is required for most paid features endpoints.\
    \ The access_token must be provided as an authorization credential (exact mechanism\
    \ for passing it\u2014header, query parameter, or request body\u2014is not explicitly\
    \ specified in this documentation chunk). One endpoint (Purchase paid feature)\
    \ indicates no authorization is required."
  - 'Access tokens are passed in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens (format:
    "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"). Access tokens expire and must be refreshed
    using a refresh token, which is valid for one month (2592000 seconds). Both tokens
    may be updated during refresh and must be stored securely in your database per
    user. Each API request requires the corresponding user''s current access token
    in the Authorization header.'
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Send `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`
    header along with `Version: 2.0` header in the request. The ACCESS_TOKEN represents
    the currently authenticated user who will own the created advert.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is used for API requests. After OAuth2 authentication,
    store the access_token and refresh_token securely. Send the access_token in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" with each API request.
    When the access_token expires (indicated by expires_in), refresh it by posting
    to /api/open/oauth/token with grant_type "refresh_token", client_id, client_secret,
    and the user''s refresh_token. The refresh_token is valid for one month (2592000
    seconds).'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.olx.bg/api/doc:
  - Pagination uses offset (integer, optional) and limit (integer, optional) query
    parameters. The response contains a data array with advert objects, but no explicit
    next/prev fields or pagination metadata are documented.
- information_source; https://developer.olx.bg/swagger/v2/partner_api.yaml:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (optional), and limit specifies the maximum number of results to return
    (optional). No response fields indicating next page or total count are documented.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (integer, starts from 1) and limit
    (integer for results per page) on the /users/me/billing and /users/me/prepaid-invoices
    endpoints. Response structure for pagination state or navigation fields is not
    documented.
  - The /users/me/postpaid-invoices endpoint uses query parameter pagination with
    page (integer, optional, starts from 1) and limit (integer, optional, number of
    results per page). The response structure does not explicitly document pagination
    metadata fields or navigation instructions.
  - The GET /users/me/packets endpoint uses offset-limit pagination. Request parameters
    are limit (query, optional, default 50) for number of results and offset (query,
    optional) for starting element. The response returns an array of BoughtPacket
    objects with no pagination metadata fields, so construct subsequent requests by
    incrementing the offset parameter.
