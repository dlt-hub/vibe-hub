auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ripple.com/payments-direct-2/api-docs/best-practices/authentication/:
  - Ripple Payments API uses Bearer Token Authorization for all operations except
    authentication. Include a valid access token in the Authorization header with
    the format "Bearer {access_token}". Access tokens are valid for 1 hour as specified
    by the expires_in field in the authentication response. Do not cache tokens client-side
    to avoid double caching issues; if cached, clear within the expiration time specified
    by the exp claim in the JWT.
  - Use OAuth2 client credentials grant to obtain access tokens. Send a POST request
    to https://api.ripple.com/v2/oauth/token with Content-Type application/json containing
    grant_type set to "client_credentials", your client_id, client_secret, and audience
    field formatted as "urn:ripplexcurrent-{ENVIRONMENT_STRING}:{YOUR_TENANT_ID}"
    where ENVIRONMENT_STRING is either "test" or "prod". The returned access token
    is then used with subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://docs.ripple.com/payments-direct/api-docs/auth-proxy/reference/:
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with client credentials. Send POST request to /oauth/token
    with client_id, client_secret, audience, and grant_type parameters. Response includes
    access_token (bearer token), token_type, scope, and expires_in. Use the access_token
    as a bearer token in subsequent requests.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow with JWT bearer tokens. Obtain an access token
    by sending client_id, client_secret, audience (urn:ripplexcurrent-prod:{YOUR_TENANT_ID}),
    and grant_type (client_credentials) to the token endpoint. Use the returned access_token
    as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for API requests. Token type is
    Bearer and includes scopes like identities:create, identities:read, identities:write,
    quote_collections:write, payments:accept, payments:read, routing_table:lookup.
    Tokens expire in 3600 seconds.
  - The Authentication API uses OAuth2-style credential exchange. To obtain an access
    token, send a POST request with client_id and client_secret in the JSON request
    body; the API returns an access_token field that must be included in subsequent
    API calls. Client credentials are generated via the Ripple Payments UI under Settings
    > Administration > API Credentials.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ripple.com/payments-direct/api-docs/best-practices/pagination/:
  - Pagination uses a query parameter `page` (default value 0) to request specific
    pages. The response includes `first` and `last` boolean fields to indicate pagination
    boundaries, `number` for the current page, and `numberOfElements` for items in
    the current page. A `size` query parameter controls page size. Stop paginating
    when `last` is true.
  - 'Response includes pagination fields: first (boolean), last (boolean), number
    (page index starting at 0), numberOfElements (items in current page), size (page
    size), totalElements (total items across all pages), and totalPages (total pages).
    Implement pagination by incrementing the page parameter by 1 with each request
    until last=true.'
  - Ripple Payments API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page and
    size. The page parameter (default 0) indicates the starting point, and size parameter
    (default 5) controls batch size. The response includes a last field; when last=false,
    more results exist and you should increment page to fetch the next batch. Stop
    paginating when last=true.
