auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.evidentid.com/api-documentation-developers/:
  - The userIdentityToken returned from VerifyAPI must be used to authenticate requests
    to SubmitAPI as a bearer token in the Authorization header. This is a multi-use
    token specific to the end user and their verification request.
  - VerifyAPI uses HTTP Basic Auth for authentication. You need to provide your username
    and API key as credentials. The production endpoint is https://verify.api.evidentid.com/api/v1
    and the sandbox endpoint is https://verify.api.demo.evidentid.com/api/v1. API
    keys are environment-specific (one for production, one for sandbox) and should
    be kept secret and only used from your server.
  - You will need your username and an API key to authenticate with VerifyAPI using
    HTTP Basic Auth. Credentials should be sent from your server only, never exposed
    client-side. You have separate API keys for production (https://verify.api.evidentid.com/api/v1)
    and sandbox (https://verify.api.demo.evidentid.com/api/v1) environments. Contact
    support@evidentid.com if you did not receive your credentials.
