auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.payplug.com/api/apiref.html:
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." where the token is a secret key.
    Additionally, the PayPlug-Version header must be included with a date value like
    "2019-08-06" and Content-Type header set to "application/json".'
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_9898098098guGYUG9" (or your actual live
    secret key) with each request to the API.'
  - Authentication uses bearer tokens provided via the HTTP Authorization header.
    Include your secret key (available from the PayPlug Portal My account section)
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer sk_live_..." or "Bearer sk_test_..." for
    live and test modes respectively. All requests must use HTTPS and include the
    PayPlug-Version header.
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token format. Send the API secret key as Authorization:
    Bearer sk_test_9898098098guGYUG9 in requests to the Payplug API. Additionally,
    include the PayPlug-Version header set to 2019-08-06.'
  - Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer sk_test_..." format. The PayPlug-Version header (e.g. "2019-08-06")
    should also be included with requests.
