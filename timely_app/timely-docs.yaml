notes:
- 'Authorization: Bearer token required for requests.'
- The 'secret_token' is used to calculate a SHA256 hash to verify requests.
- Webhooks use OAuth2 access tokens for authentication.
- The URL for webhook requests must use HTTPS
- Use SHA256 to verify X-Signature against SECRET_TOKEN for security
- Requires HTTPS for webhook URL
- Ensure to calculate a SHA256 hash for the received payload
