auth_info:
- information_source; https://ovo.id/partner-integration/payment-api/tech-doc:
  - Authentication uses RSA asymmetric signatures with SHA256 and HMAC SHA-512 symmetric
    signatures. For asymmetric auth, include the client ID in the X-Partner-ID header,
    add the generated signature to the X-Signature header, and add the timestamp to
    the X-Timestamp header. The signature is generated by SHA256 hashing a message
    (either "clientID|timestamp" for token requests or "method:fullPath:finalBody:timestamp"
    for account binding) and then signing with RSA private key. For symmetric auth,
    use SHA-512 HMAC with the Client Secret as the key. Required environment variables
    are clientID and _private_key.
  - 'Bearer token authentication with additional mandatory security headers. Send
    Bearer token (format: Bearer gp9HjjEj813Y9) in Authorization header. Include X-CLIENT-KEY
    (client_id), X-TIMESTAMP (current time), X-SIGNATURE (SHA256withRSA signed with
    private key from environment variable {clientID}_private_key), X-DEVICE-ID, and
    X-EXTERNAL-ID headers. X-PARTNER-ID is conditional. Private key must be configured
    as environment variable named {clientID}_private_key, and generated signature
    and timestamp are output as environment variables gen_signature and gen_timestamp
    respectively for header injection.'
  - Client ID is sent via x-partner-id request header. Access token is sent via Authorization
    header with Bearer {access_token} format. Secret key is configured via environment
    variable named {clientID}_secret_key. Signature is generated by HMAC-SHA256 hashing
    the request method, full path, timestamp, and SHA256-hashed request body, then
    sent in X-Signature header. Timestamp is sent in X-Timestamp header in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSZ
    format.
- information_source; https://www.ovo.id/partner-integration/push-to-pay/tech-doc:
  - API requests require HMAC-SHA256 authentication via custom headers. Send app-id
    (merchant identifier), random (Unix timestamp), and hmac (SHA256 hash of concatenated
    app-id + random + request body, using a provided secret key) in request headers.
    Content-Type must be application/json.
  - 'Push to Pay API uses HMAC-based request signing for authentication. Each request
    requires an HMAC signature calculated from the request body and a shared secret
    key, sent as a custom header along with a partner/merchant identifier.


    To authenticate, you must include the partner identifier (merchant ID) and an
    HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request payload in the request headers. The HMAC
    is computed using your secret key provided by OVO during credential setup. Exact
    header names and signature algorithm details should be confirmed in the full API
    specification, as this excerpt does not provide the complete header names or signature
    format.'
