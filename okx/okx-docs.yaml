  - '# Auth Information Extracted


    The OKX SpreadTrading API uses three-part credential authentication. Pass apikey,
    secretkey, and passphrase to the SpreadTradingAPI constructor. These credentials
    are used internally by the SDK to sign requests and authenticate with the API.
    The flag parameter (0 for production, 1 for demo) determines the trading environment
    but is not part of authentication itself.'
  - API Key authentication is used for sub-account management. Sub-account API Keys
    require specific permissions (read_only or trade) and can be restricted to linked
    IP addresses (up to 20). The apiKey is passed in request bodies, and master account
    API Keys must be linked to IP addresses to perform operations like deleting sub-account
    API Keys.
  - 'API Key authentication with three credentials passed to the SubAccountAPI client:
    apikey, secretkey, and passphrase. The apikey must be linked to IP addresses for
    master accounts. Include flag parameter to specify production (0) or demo (1)
    trading environment.'
  - 'API authentication uses API Key-based signing. Send a login operation with apiKey,
    passphrase, timestamp (Unix seconds), and sign (HMAC SHA256 signature of concatenated
    timestamp+method+requestPath, encrypted with SecretKey and Base64-encoded). The
    signature algorithm: concatenate timestamp, method, requestPath as a string, then
    HMAC SHA256 encrypt using SecretKey and Base64 encode the result.'
  - 'API initialization requires three credential parameters passed to the SavingsAPI
    constructor: apikey (API key), secretkey (secret key), and passphrase. These credentials
    must be obtained from your OKX account and are used to authenticate requests to
    the API.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-okx.mustprofit.cn/docs-v5/en/:
  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before parameters. The after parameter
    returns records earlier than the specified ordId, before returns records newer
    than the specified ordId. The limit parameter controls results per request with
    a maximum of 100 and default of 100.
  - Every page has 20 records. Use the `annType` parameter to filter announcement
    types in the request.
  - Pagination is supported with query parameters limit (optional, default 100, max
    100) and after (optional cursor for retrieving records after a specific bill).
    The response is sorted with most recent first, and you continue paginating by
    using the after value from the previous response until no more records are returned.
  - Pagination is supported with the response sorted most recent first. Use query
    parameters `after` (bill ID to paginate after) and `limit` (number of results,
    default and max typically 100) to control pagination; the response includes a
    `data` array and pagination metadata to determine if more results exist.
  - Pagination uses a limit parameter in the query string to control results per request,
    with a maximum of 100 and default of 100. The begin and end parameters allow filtering
    by timestamp to retrieve records within a specific range, enabling manual pagination
    through historical data.
