  - API Key authentication is required. Pass your API Key as a query parameter named
    `apikey` in the request URL (e.g., `?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`). The API Key must be
    included with every request to endpoints like weather, weekly-projections, and
    weekly-rankings.
  - API authentication uses a query parameter named apikey. Include your API key as
    the apikey query parameter in the request URL, for example apikey=TEST where TEST
    is replaced with your actual API key.
  - API authentication uses an apikey query parameter. Include your API Key as the
    apikey query parameter in all requests to the endpoints (e.g., ?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY).
    The example value shown is TEST, which should be replaced with your actual API
    Key.
  - API key authentication is required for all endpoints. Pass your API key as the
    apikey query parameter in the request URL (e.g., ?apikey=YOUR_KEY). The API key
    value should be appended to each endpoint request.
