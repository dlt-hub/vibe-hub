notes:
- Requires setup of Firebase project for push notifications.
- Use 'com.pulsatehq.sdk:pulsatesdk:3.0.0' as the SDK dependency.
- Pulsate helps you deepen the relationship with customers.
- After integrating CocoaPods with your project, please remember to always use the
  *.xcworkspace file, not *.xcodeproj to open your project.
- Be careful when updating the PULPulsate pod. It'll overwrite all the UI and language
  customizations you might have in your PULPulsateBasic.bundle.
- Pulsate automatically starts and ends sessions after the first session.
- If you do not need to logout the user, don't do it.
- In order to test APNS on development builds you need to have your Pulsate app set
  to Development, not Production.
- Before asking users for permissions we recommend you show them a Priming screen
  or message that explains why this permission is needed and what it will be used
  for. Priming screens can help increase opt in rates. Google might also ask you to
  add a priming screen or popup during the App review process.
- 'Feed Orientation: Highly recommended to use in Portrait mode exclusively.'
- Pulsate collects all data anonymously unless you explicitly decide to pass personal
  data such as an email address or the first and last name of a customer.
- You can pass an unlimited amount of custom attributes.
- When sending a date, the format should be yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, timezone is UTC.
- Deeplinks must be unique
- To create a Deeplink that opens the Phone App and enters a phone number just create
  a Deeplink with an url formatted like this 'tel:+123456789'.
- Custom Theming is no longer available on the App side in SDK 4.7.0.
- Pulsate SDK 4.2.0 allows storing configuration files locally.
- Pulsate SDK 4.7.0 now uses a Web Feed, Language Localization for the Feed is no
  longer available on the App / SDK side.
- The Pulsate SDK takes care of synchronizing the badge number on app's icon in iPhone
  home screen.
- You can access the badge number by using the applicationIconBadgeNumber property.
- Unsubscribed users will still be tracked when they enter or exit a geofence or beacon
  and we will still capture segment data for them. However, they will not receive
  any campaigns or messages from Pulsate.
- By default all users are opted in.
- Unauthorized users will not be able to enter the inbox via a notification.
- Pulsate takes ownership of the AppDelegate by default
- If the deployment target is below iOS 10, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate cannot
  be used as a global variable
- Requires setup of connected app in Pulsate
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- In App notifications are only shown to logged in users
- Please make sure to add "NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription" to all Apps that use
  Pulsate.
- If "NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription" is missing and Pulsate or the Developer tries
  to create a CBCentralManager the App will crash for the user.
- New method 'UserHasLoggedIn' enables in apps and shows last bounced in app.
- New method 'UserHasLoggedOut' disables in apps and sets user as unauthorized.
- PulsateSDK 4.6.0 supports Android API 28 - 34
- PulsateSDK 4.6.1 supports Android API 28 - 35
- The newest version of the SDK can be found here - https://pulsate.readme.io/v2.8.2/reference/android-sdk-release-notes
- Starting a Pulsate Session requires an Activity
- Logout prevents users from receiving Pulsate Campaigns
- Pulsate sessions will be active in the background and trigger geofences / beacons
  / pushes / manage sessions and you will only show In Apps to logged in users.
- Before Android Tiramisu (API 33) push notification permission was granted by default,
  with the release of Android Tiramisu (API 33) that is no longer the case.
- Different Android versions require different permissions and must be asked for in
  the proper way.
- 'By default App Icon badges are ON. To change this value in your Application onCreate
  method call: PulsateConfig.NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SHOW_BADGES = false'
- This method has a 30sec debounce so you can not directly access unread count more
  often than once every 30secs.
- Default Pulsate uses a 'Red Dot' image for notifications.
- 'Recommended icon size: MDPI - 24 x 24, HDPI - 36 x 36, XHDPI - 48 x 48, XXHDPI
  - 72 x 72, XXXHDPI - 96 x 96.'
- Pulsate collects all data anonymously unless you explicitly decide to pass personal
  data.
- It is vital that you have your customers'/users' permission to send any personal
  data.
- Always remember to send user data only after a user session has already started.
- Default - ENABLED.
- Unauthorized users will not be able to enter the inbox in any way.
- Developers can directly access the Pulsate Feed API to get the Pulsate Feed Models.
- Using Proguard requires adding 'minifyEnabled true' in your build config.
- As of version 2.13.6 the PulsateSDK imports with Proguard settings.
- These proguard rules will be used in apps that use obfuscation automatically.
- Set minSdkVersion to 21 (Android 5.0)
- During Test Mode the SDK will show a notification that the SDK is in Test Mode
- Default settings may apply for various features.
- Make sure to initialize the SDK properly.
