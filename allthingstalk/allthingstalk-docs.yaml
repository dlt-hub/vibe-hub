auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.allthingstalk.com/developers/api/authentication/:
  - Ground Tokens are API tokens created per ground device and passed directly in
    requests for simple client authorization. OAuth2 is partially supported for user
    clients (web, mobile, postman) using the password grant type with username, password,
    and client_id, requiring MFA authentication via POST to https://api.allthingstalk.io/login
    with form-encoded parameters grant_type, username, password, and client_id, returning
    an access token for subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://docs.allthingstalk.com/developers/api/get-started/:
  - 'Authentication uses bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" in all requests to the API endpoints.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <TOKEN>" for HTTP requests, or use it as the MQTT username with an
    empty password for MQTT connections.
  - 'Device token-based bearer authentication. Add the token to the Authorization
    header as `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`. The token is scoped to the specific
    device and will be blocked if used to access user or ground resources outside
    its authorized scope.'
- information_source; https://docs.allthingstalk.com/developers/api/get-started/first-device/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer maker:<DeviceToken>". For MQTT connections, use the token as the username
    with an empty password.
