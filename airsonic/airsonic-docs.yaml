auth_info:
- information_source; https://airsonic.github.io/docs/api/:
  - Subsonic API authentication uses token and salt-based authentication instead of
    plain text passwords. Generate a token and salt for use with the API; refer to
    the Subsonic API documentation at http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp for complete
    authentication details and implementation.
  - 'Subsonic API uses token-based authentication with MD5 hashing. Generate a random
    salt (minimum 10 characters), then create a token by computing md5(password +
    salt). Pass username, token, and salt as query parameters: u=<username>, t=<token>,
    s=<salt>, along with required v (version) and c (client name) parameters in requests
    to the API endpoint.'
