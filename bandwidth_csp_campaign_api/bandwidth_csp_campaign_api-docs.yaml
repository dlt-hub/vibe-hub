pagination_info:
- information_source; https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/messaging/campaign-management/csp/campaign-api:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (required, starts at 0) and size (required,
    specifies number of results per page). The response includes a paginated list
    of campaigns; continue fetching with incrementing page values until all results
    are retrieved.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0) and size (number of results
    per page). The request example shows page=0&size=2, indicating offset-based pagination
    where you increment the page parameter to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0) and size to control results
    per page. The response is wrapped in a CampaignsResponse element containing a
    Campaigns collection, but no explicit next/previous fields or continuation tokens
    are shown for navigating pages.
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters page and size. The response includes a TotalCount
    field indicating the total number of campaigns. The Location header in error responses
    shows an example: page=0&size=2, suggesting page-based pagination with zero-based
    indexing and configurable page size.'
- information_source; https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/messaging:
  - Continuation-Token header parameter enables pagination for listing media files.
    Use the Continuation-Token value from a previous response as the Continuation-Token
    header in the next request to retrieve additional media. When no Continuation-Token
    is returned, all media has been retrieved.
