notes:
- Categories must always be delimited by a slash.
- The Products API takes an array of product metadata and has no hard limit on the
  number of items that you can specify and is only limited by the maximum size of
  the payload of 2 MB.
- Every Nosto account has a unique identifier known as accountID, which is required
  in the implementation.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Nosto
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Both behavioral and transactional data needs to be sent manually.
- If you happen to call the interface via HTTP using a valid API key, that API key
  will be invalidated immediately.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in nosto
- The extension automatically adds product recommendation elements to the store when
  installed.
- Every time a product is updated in the store, the information is sent to Nosto over
  an API.
- Nosto has a time window of 30 minutes for cancelled orders be taken into account.
- Nosto Plugin can be used with Shopware versions starting from 6.5.4.0
- Nosto allows you to deliver every customer a personalized shopping experience through
  recommendations based on their unique user behavior.
- You need to have Nosto account configured and Nosto must be enabled in your storefront
  in order to use the debug toolbar.
- Nosto requires setup of connected app in Salesforce
- JavaScript API works only in on-site context.
- Using the API does not require authentication but requires that Nosto embed script
  is included.
- The script and the snippet should be added as high up in the <head> portion of the
  page.
- This needs to exist on every page.
- The product ID of the product tagging, cart tagging and order tagging must match.
  Failure to do so will lead to a mismatch in both attribution and statistics across
  the Nosto product.
- Customer information should be tagged if the customer is logged in.
- Marketing permission is false by default unless explicitly set to true.
- The product tagging must be server-side rendered as the Nosto crawler does not execute
  Javascript.
- Page type must always be lowercase.
- When the search term exists as a part of the URL's query parameters, Nosto can be
  configured to read the search term and you can skip the search term tagging.
- When the search term exists as a part of the URL, Nosto is unable to read it from
  the URL and you will need to tag as a part of the page source.
- All requests to these endpoints are asynchronous and may take up to 24 hours for
  the redaction process to complete.
- All requests to this endpoint are asynchronous and simply enqueue the email address
  for takeout.
- It may take up to 24 hours for the takeout process to complete.
- The Discontinue API takes an array of product metadata and has no hard limit on
  the number of items that you can specify and is only limited by the maximum size
  of the payload of 2 MB.
- The Recrawl API takes an array of product ids and URLs and has no hard limit on
  the number of items that you can specify.
- You can recrawl as often as you need but bear in mind that every recrawl adds an
  extra page load to your server.
