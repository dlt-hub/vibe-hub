notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- External documentation available for different OAuth2 flows.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This release forces a blocking re-index. Make sure to plan enough time for this
  update as your users will not be able to access the database while the re-index
  is running.
- This release enables the janitor which purges deleted objects (if configured) and
  also unlinks files from deleted objects to save disk space (if configured).

  new data records are created for values for which no data record exists yet.
- The Server URL of the remote instance is mandatory.
- Connector user login name is mandatory.
- Connector user password is mandatory.
- Client ID of a remote fylr is mandatory if the remote instance is a fylr.
- Client Secret of a remote fylr is mandatory if the remote instance is configured
  with a secret.
- Only images are currently supported and that the deletion of files in Wordpress
  is currently not supported.
- Values for linked data records are also searched for in the system.
- Uses letsencrypt for HTTPS certificates
- Requires a running container engine like docker
- 'fylr is build on top of open source technologies: PostgreSQL, OpenSearch (fylr
  can use Elasticsearch instead), Media processing tools: libvips, ExifTool, FFmpeg,
  etc.'
- Under Linux it is usually deployed in our containers, via docker or kubernetes.
- The shorter the path of your fylr installation directory, the less likely your installation
  will fail processing files due to exceeding the length limit.
- If you make your installation path too long, LibreOffice will not work.
- 'If unsure about wasting your quota with letsencrypt, start with useStagingCA: true.
  A staging certificate will not be enough, though.'
- 'Do not use the frontend without a valid certificate (useStagingCA: false).'
- This URL needs to be fully qualified.
- If you change this URL for an existing database, a re-index is needed to update
  all object caches.
- 4 parallel jobs instruct the indexer to add changed and new data to the index.
- 10 workers check whether further conversions can be started, for standard preview
  versions.
- '18 workers check whether further processing can be started: Like reading metadata
  from new assets and everything else.'
- 2 simultaneous processing of video/office preview images are allowed.
- 6 simultaneous processing of image previews are allowed.
- 10 simultaneous metadata readouts are allowed.
- User experience in Frontend is slowed down by one type of asset processing
- User experience in Frontend is slowed down by asset processing in general
- Asset processing is too slow
- Reduce the number allowed jobs of that type. E. g. only allow one video conversion
  at a time
- Reduce the number of allowed concurrent jobs
- Increase the number of allowed concurrent jobs
- load plugins at startup. the loader crawls the given directories and loads given
  files for plugin config files, ending in '.yml'. '*' and '?' are allowed as placeholders,
  unmatched directories or files are silently skipped.
- Configuration is done in fylr.yml and the web-frontend of fylr.
- Initial values in fylr.yml are copied to the database on first use.
- Recommended only for internal use.
- No authentication required for accessing DNS domains.
- fylr always has only one main DNS domain, configured in fylr.yml's externalURL,
  and fylr will redirect to this URL and use it for its image URLs.
- The domain in externalURL has to be part of your fylr license. Except when testing
  as the fylr root user or on localhost.
- If fylr shall react to additional domains besides the one main domain, make sure
  that these are also present in the certificate that fylr uses.
- If you let fylr retrieve the certificate automatically, you need to configure them
  as additionalDomains in fylr.yml.
- When you change fylr's main domain, configured as externalURL, so after changing
  fylr.yml and restart, you need to do a re-index.
- During that re-index, even if it is running in the background, preview images will
  not be visible.
- Licenses are bound to domains so make sure you have a license for the new main domain
  configured as externalURL.
- Make sure that you either have a certificate for the new domain or to let fylr automatically
  retrieve a certificate for the new domain.
- This SQL does include data model, objects, users, groups, user rights and base configuration.
- But not assets and not log messages.
- When you change fylr's main domain, configured as externalURL, a re-index is required.
- During the re-index, preview images will not be visible until the re-index is complete.
- Licenses are bound to domains, ensure you have a license for the new main domain.
- Ensure a certificate for the new domain is available or let fylr retrieve one automatically.
- The migration tools should not be used for any data backups!
- The process is not intended for PostgreSQL upgrades.
- Not all events will be migrated from easydb5 to fylr, because they have no purpose
  in fylr.
- Make sure that the postgresql DB and elasticsearch indices are empty from previous
  attempts on the new server so that there is no collision of data.
- 'You may need to force a re-index in Elasticsearch: surf to /inspect/system/ on
  the new server, so e.g. https://new-server.example.com/inspect/system/ and click
  a Reindex button.'
- The source instance should not be changed or even disconnected during test migrations!
- In a backup no actual files are included, but instead the URLs to files are part
  of the records and are referenced and used during restoring.
- Make sure there is enough disk space on the target system to store all files!
- This overview only shows the latest versions of records, and no deleted records.
- This overview shows all versions of records, as well as deleted records.
- Make sure to select 'Latest' in the 'Versions' dropdown, to only get the latest
  and non-deleted versions, only these values are valid numbers to check the migration.
- If the numbers match, then all data from the source was migrated into the target
  instance.
- In general, this should not be possible, there can not be more records in the backup
  than in the source.
- Make sure that the overview page in fylr only shows the latest, non-deleted records.
- Make sure that all records with files have been in the backup, and that all payloads
  have been restored.
- This endpoint is used to insert payloads for restoration.
- Some API calls may require additional permissions.
- In a backup no actual files are included, but instead the URLs to files are part
  of the records and are referenced and used during restoring. Until the final migration
  is finished and all files and their versions have been copied to the target instance,
  these URLs need to be reachable, otherwise no files can be copied and will be missing!
- Make sure to select 'Latest' in the 'Versions' dropdown, to only get the latest
  and non-deleted versions.
- Only these values are valid numbers to check the migration.
- The restore process is always performed with --purge
- fylr can use various authentication services for user logins and rights management.
- fylr can be connected to multiple LDAP servers.
- fylr can be configured to be a Service Provider against a SAML IDP.
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory can be connected via SAML to fylr.
- Assuming you use a docker-compose.yml file and your hotfolder will be located at
  /srv/fylr/_hotfolder
- Set webDAVHotfolderPath in your fylr.yml
- Blurred previews can be displayed from the SQL database without needing any access
  to the actual asset images or asset previews.
- Whenever there is a problem accessing preview images, fylr falls back to just showing
  the blurred previews from the tiny 'blur hash' saved in SQL database.
- In fylr, assets and previews are strongly linked to the URL.
- If you change fylr's URL, only blurred previews are available.
- fylr can use the following authentication services (a.k.a. SSO - Single Sign On)
  to authenticate user logins.
- Recreate your fylr container to apply changes
- We recommend to set the limits in fylr and postgres to the same number.
- If you increase the limit in PostgreSQL, the error might go away or appear less
  frequent.
- 'Frontend Error Dialog popups show something like: `too_many_nested_clauses Query
  contains too many nested clauses; maxClauseCount is set to 1024`'
- This may appear e.g. directly after logging into the fylr webfrontend.
- This user cannot see records or pools that they should be allowed to see, according
  to rights management.
- For the indexer (ElasticSearch or OpenSearch), allow more clauses per search.
- This can lead to performance degradations and memory issues.
- 'E.g. add to docker-compose.yml the one line about clauses: (default is 1024)'
- Processing of an asset file used more time than the configured timeout.
- Reduce load on the hardware so that processing per asset is faster.
- If you change fylr's URL, only blurred previews are available. This can be remedied
  with a re-index, which updates the URL associated with assets and their previews.
- fylr messages, fylr output, docker logs
- fylr cannot currently actually purge objects from database.
- All objects are stored in historic versions, also deleted objects are kept in the
  database with a flag deleted.
- Make sure to have a backup before using this procedure.
- This is a very dangerous tool and can easily lead to data loss.
- The SQL here is provided as is, with no warranty and responsibility.
- If you use a limit far below what your hardware can handle, you may slow fylr down.
- If you increase this limit, the error might go away or appear less frequent.
- But PostgreSQL may consume more memory.
- Please refer to [installation](/for-system-administrators/installation), [configuration](/for-system-administrators/configuration)
  and [backups](/for-system-administrators/backup) for more information and make sure
  to get a [license](/license-management).
- 'Increase the timeout in fylr.yml. Default: 2400 seconds'
- Reduce load on the hardware to make processing faster
- When using the Hotfolder, uploaded files will be deleted from the WebDAV folder
  after import.
- With the File System Connect, files will stay in the WebDAV folder after being imported.
- docker-compose is considered deprecated and should be replaced with docker compose
- Users need system rights 'Access Search' with 'Create Collections' or 'Access Quick
  Access Only (No Search)'
- Users need permission to create new records, upload files and read permissions to
  at least one pool
- fylr cannot currently actually purge objects from database. All objects are stored
  in historic versions, also deleted objects are kept in the database with a flag
  deleted. These objects can be linked to files.
- Make sure to have a backup before using this procedure. This is a very dangerous
  tool and can easily lead to data loss.
- Use at your own risk!
- The 'PDF Creator' plugin is licensed as a separate module.
- When using File System Connect, files that are deleted from the WebDAV folder will
  also be deleted from FYLR and cannot be restored.
- Ensure Server PDF Plugin and PDF Creator Plugin are enabled
- Templates can be created and edited under Rights Management
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in fylr
- The path given needs to make sense inside the container filesystem hierarchy.
- Typically, the path is mapped to the outside of the container to the server file
  system, for space requirements or persistence.
- Exporting metadata requires running a script to download the data.
- CSV Importer must include '_system_object_id' in import mapping.
- To extract the overlayed file, the configuration file has to be specified with -c
  /fylr/config/fylr.yml.
- The Hotfolder and File System Connect are only available through collections.
- Group settings are optional and recommended to configure after user login settings
  are working.
- The "PDF Creator" plugin is licensed as a separate module.
- Connects to SAML authentication service for logging in.
- Log Steps is recommended to debug SAML connections.
- The metadata mapping profiles can only be applied when uploading new files
- If a file has no metadata in the specified groups or fields, it will not be included
  in the CSV file unless you enable 'Include files without matching metadata'
- In the case, the configuration file has to be specified with -c /fylr/config/fylr.yml,
  because this is the path in the fylr container.
- -c has to be specified after the resources command.
- 'Make sure you have in your fylr.yml: allowpurge: true at the exact following indentation
  depth.'
- Changed or deleted data records in fylr are not synchronized with TYPO3. Changes
  to the data record must be transferred to TYPO3 manually.
- The name of the plugin may change its name from easydb to fylr.
- Group settings are optional and should be configured after user login settings.
- fylr's metadata URL is https://FYLR.EXAMPLE.COM/api/saml/metadata.
- This plugin is a paid feature. The ZIP package is only available after a valid license
  has been purchased.
- Each named list entry in the Plugin Managers configuration tab of the ai-metadata
  plugin becomes available in the Metadata Mapping section of fylr.
- To run the ai-metadata plugin in background tasks, creating a new background task
  from a selection of records to be mapped by the ai-metadata plugin is currently
  not supported.
- This fylr needs to have the CI HUB capability in its fylr license.
- By default all fylr installations have the 'OAuth client' named 'ci-hub' configured.
- The API documentation is work in progress!
- Most endpoints act the same across different instances of fylr.
- Purge is a destructive intervention requiring safety barriers to be turned off.
- This plugin is a paid feature.
- Without API Key, requests to OpenAI will be denied.
- This fylr needs to have the CI HUB capability in its fylr license. This is not part
  of all fylr licenses.
- By default all fylr installations have the 'OAuth client' named 'ci-hub' configured,
  so this should not be an issue.
- The API documentation is work in progress
- Most of the API is the same in easydb 5 and fylr.
- Text must be encoded in UTF-8 and stored in all normalization forms.
- Text is normalized using the icu_normalizer and tokenized into tokens.
- The type `number` stores integers between `-(2**53)+1` and (`2**53)-1`.
- The value is stored with a 2-digit fraction without loss.
- Text must be encoded in UTF-8 and stores in all normalization forms.
- All text for indexed documents is split into chunks of 8000 UTF-8 characters.
- Numbers are guaranteed to keep their value, but the JSON parser may change `1e4`
  into `10000` upon load.
- The export of the value is not localized.
- The API treats the types date and datetime the same.
- The parser does not support sending a timezone for shortened date strings.
- Sorting is not supported for the geojson type.
- The license is not needed to use GeoJSON over /api/db, but it is for /api/search.
- The integer.2 type is like a currency type, stored with a 2-digit fraction without
  loss.
- All HTTP Methods are available for the endpoint.
- An access token is required.

- if you remove a translation from the Google Sheet or leave it empty, the key will
  be shown in the frontend instead
- if you don’t want the text / key to be shown in the frontend just enter '-' instead
  of leaving the cell empty
- Encrypted communication is not needed for that, as this is intended as the publicly
  known part of the key.
