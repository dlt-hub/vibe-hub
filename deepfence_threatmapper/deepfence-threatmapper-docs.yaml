notes:
- To access the interactive API documentation, enter the following URL in your web
  browser
- YaraHunter scans container images, running Docker containers, and filesystems to
  find indicators of malware.
- Deepfence Cloud is free for 14 days, you can create up to 2 consoles and allows
  20 hosts to be monitored
- All the consoles and data will be deleted from Deepfence Cloud after 14 days from
  the date of expiry of license.
- The Management console generates an API key and a URL which you will need when you
  install the Sensor containers and Cloud Scanner tasks.
- Account admins are notified 5 days before deleting consoles.
- All the consoles and data will be deleted from Deepfence Cloud after 14 days from
  the date of expiry of license
- Account admins are notified 5 days before deleting consoles
- Each ThreatStryker console has a dedicated, persistent DNS name, and manages its
  own API keys to authenticate traffic.
- Deepfence Cloud is currently in 'Invite Only' mode.
- A valid API key for the management console is required, which can be obtained from
  the User Management page in the console UI.
- You can configure any OpenID Connect ID provider like Okta.
- Once you have installed the Management Console, you need to register an admin user
  and obtain the API key needed by the ThreatStryker sensors.
- A single ThreatStryker Console can manage multiple workload types, and on-premise
  and cloud deployments simultaneously.
- Refer to the Docker Installation Instructions along with the modifications.
- Using certificate verification is highly recommended but may require a custom certificate
  bundle.
- Every path/method combo becomes a Python module with four functions.
- Using certificate verification is highly recommended.
- SSL verification is recommended but can be disabled, which is a security risk.
- Uses API Key for authentication
- SSL verification is recommended
- Disabling certificate validation is a security risk.
- Requires SSL verification unless specified otherwise
- The Management Console generates an API key and a URL which you will need when you
  install the Sensor containers and Cloud Scanner tasks.
- Management Console is managed over TLS (port 443), used for administrative traffic
  and for sensor traffic.
- Compliance Posture Scanning for Clouds requires access (typically read-only) to
  the cloud platform APIs.
- Cloud Scanner tasks are deployed using the appropriate Terraform module for each
  cloud.
- Credentials provide read-only access to a live ThreatMapper instance.
- Build host requires 16 Gb RAM, 4 cores.
- 'Packages needed: build tools, golang, docker, docker-compose.'
- Refer to the Docker Installation Instructions along with the modifications below.
- You can use these instructions for helm-based installations in standalone and hosted
  Kubernetes clusters.
- Using certificate verification is highly recommended most of the time, but sometimes
  you may need to authenticate to a server using a custom certificate bundle.
- You can disable certificate validation altogether, but this is a security risk.
- Using API Key for authentication
- SSL verification is recommended but can be disabled
- When calling an HTTPS API, SSL verification is recommended.
- Uses API key for authentication.
- You will likely encounter a warning about an invalid SSL/TLS certificate, because
  the console is using an internally-generated self-signed cert.
- Account Registration details are private to your Management Console, and are not
  shared with Deepfence or other third parties.
