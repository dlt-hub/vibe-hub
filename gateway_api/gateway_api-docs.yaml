auth_info:
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/:
  - Authentication uses OAuth 1.0a with consumer key and secret. The key is passed
    as the first parameter to OkHttpOAuthConsumer and the secret as the second parameter.
    Requests must be signed using an OAuth signing interceptor that adds the required
    Authorization header with OAuth signature parameters (oauth_consumer_key, oauth_signature_method,
    oauth_signature, oauth_timestamp, oauth_nonce, oauth_version). The consumer key
    and secret are obtained by generating an API key and secret through the provider's
    system.
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/docs/apis/email/:
  - The API uses API key authentication or signature-based authentication. A 401 Unauthorized
    response indicates invalid API key or signature, suggesting credentials must be
    included with requests (likely in headers or as request parameters), though the
    specific header/parameter names and transmission method are not detailed in this
    excerpt.
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/docs/apis/legacy/http/:
  - Username and password credentials are sent as plaintext GET query parameters named
    username and password. HTTPS must be used because credentials are transmitted
    in plaintext. The credentials are required for every request to authenticate the
    sender.
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/docs/apis/prices-balance/:
  - The API uses API key or signature-based authentication. A 401 Unauthorized response
    indicates an invalid API key or signature, and a 403 Forbidden response indicates
    an unauthorized IP address. Credentials must be provided with requests, though
    the exact header name and transmission method are not specified in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/docs/apis/rest/:
  - API key authentication is required and can be sent via JSON body (token field),
    URL query parameter (token parameter), or GET request query string. A 401 Unauthorized
    response indicates an invalid API key or signature, and a 403 Forbidden response
    indicates an unauthorized IP address.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://gatewayapi.com/docs/apis/rest/:
  - Page-based pagination with query parameters page (page number) and per_page (results
    per page, max 200). Response includes page (current page), pages (total pages
    available), per_page (results per page), results (total results), and messages
    (array of message objects).
