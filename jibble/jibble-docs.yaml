    header using the format "Bearer {token}".
  - Jibble API uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for machine-to-machine authentication.
    Send a POST request with client_id and client_secret to obtain a Bearer access
    token, then include the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}"
    for subsequent API requests. Client credentials are created in the Organization
    settings tab by the organization owner.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow. POST to https://identity.prod.jibble.io/connect/token
    with urlencoded body containing grant_type=client_credentials, client_id, and
    client_secret. Returns access_token in response with token_type Bearer. Client
    ID and secret are created by organization owner in organization settings. Use
    returned access_token as Bearer token in subsequent API requests.
