- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- JWT Token has an expiration period of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Use refreshToken to obtain a new token without providing credentials again.
- General Information about Pre-/Backorders
- Substitute items can just be configured via API
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- It is possible that an order could not be routed, for example because all available
  facilities can't pass a specific fence.
- After a configurable amount of time (in minutes), such an order is set into a “not_routable”
  state if it could not be routed to any facility beforehand. The default is set to
  8 hours.
- Our eventing mechanism does not guarantee correct ordering of events.
- We guarantee an at least once delivery of events.
- The fulfillmenttools Connect app is a certified integration connector that synchronizes
  information between your commercetools project and your fulfillmenttools project.
- You can learn more about commercetools Connect.
- Eventing does not guarantee correct ordering of events.
- At least once delivery of events.
- The connector makes use of commercetools subscriptions to get notified once the
  OrderState of an Order is changed to Confirmed.
- Depending on the shipping method of the commercetools order, either a Ship-from-Store
  order or a Click&Collect order is created in fulfillmenttools.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Spanish is supported as a new language in Backoffice, Operations Web App, Operations

- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- If the service reachable by the callbackUrl does not answer in time or with a response
  code other than 200 OK the subscription will initiate an exponential retry pattern.
- '200 OK: Subscription must respond with this code to signal successful receipt of
  the event.'
- Delivery failure results in exponential backoff for retries.
