auth_info:
- information_source; https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/profiles/v1/docs:
  - 'This API supports two authentication methods: Personal API Token (PAT) and OIDC
    (OpenID Connect). Clients must send credentials via the appropriate verification
    endpoints (/account/verification/pat or /account/verification/oidc) or use tokens
    obtained from /account/pat endpoint for PAT-based authentication.'
- information_source; https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/profiles/v1/openapi.json:
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: PRIVATE-TOKEN header for Personal
    Access Token (PAT) authentication, and authorization header for OIDC token-based
    authentication. Both headers are optional but at least one should be provided
    to authenticate requests to protected endpoints like /account/licences.'
  - 'The API supports two optional authentication methods sent via headers: a PRIVATE-TOKEN
    header for token-based authentication, and an Authorization header (typically
    for bearer tokens or other standard auth schemes). Both are optional parameters
    but appear to be the primary auth mechanisms for account-related endpoints.'
  - 'The API supports two optional authentication methods via HTTP headers: the PRIVATE-TOKEN
    header (for PATCH requests) and the authorization header (for PATCH, POST, and
    PUT requests). Both are optional parameters sent in the request headers, with
    authorization accepting a string value.'
  - 'The API supports two optional authentication methods via request headers: the
    Authorization header (type string) or the PRIVATE-TOKEN header. Both are passed
    as HTTP headers and appear to be alternative ways to authenticate requests, with
    neither being strictly required based on the schema definitions shown.'
