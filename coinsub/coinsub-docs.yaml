auth_info:
- information_source; https://app.theneo.io/crypto-payment/api/product:
  - 'API key and merchant ID authentication required. Send credentials via two headers:
    API-Key with your API key value and Merchant-ID with your merchant ID value. Client
    authentication failures return status code invalid_client.'
  - API-Key header is required and must contain your API key. Merchant-ID header is
    also required and must contain your merchant ID. Both headers must be included
    in requests to authenticate.
  - 'The API requires two custom headers for authentication: API-Key (your API key)
    and Merchant-ID (your merchant ID). Both must be included in every request to
    the endpoint.'
  - 'The API requires two required headers for authentication: API-Key (sent as the
    header ''API-Key'') and Merchant-ID (sent as the header ''Merchant-ID''). Both
    must be provided with each request to authenticate the client.'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://app.theneo.io/crypto-payment/api/agreements:
  - The response includes a has_more field indicating whether additional pages exist.
    However, no request parameters for pagination (such as page, limit, offset, or
    cursor) are documented in this endpoint specification, so the pagination mechanism
    for retrieving subsequent pages is not described.
- information_source; https://app.theneo.io/crypto-payment/api/gather-interest-button:
  - Query parameters page (page number) and per_page (results per page) control pagination
    as optional query string parameters. The response contains a data object with
    total_clicks but does not explicitly indicate next/previous page fields, has_more
    flags, or total count in the response structure shown.
  - page and per_page are query parameters for pagination; page specifies the page
    number and per_page specifies results per page. Stop paginating when the response
    contains fewer results than per_page or when no next page is indicated.
- information_source; https://app.theneo.io/crypto-payment/api/gather-interest-button/resend-verification-email-2:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (required, starting at 1) and per_page (required,
    controls results per page). The response includes a data object with responses
    array containing paginated results. Continue to next page by incrementing the
    page parameter value.
  - Query parameters page (page number) and per_page (results per page) control pagination.
    The response does not explicitly indicate pagination fields like next, has_more,
    or total_count, so stopping criteria are unclear from this documentation.
