auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.nicejob.com/docs/reference/rest:
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required. The flow involves three steps: redirect the
    user to https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/authorize to obtain consent and receive
    an authorization code, then POST that code to https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/token
    to get an access token and refresh token. Additional endpoints available are https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/revoke
    for token revocation and https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/introspect for token introspection.'
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow with refresh tokens. Authorization code is obtained
    via redirect to `https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/authorize`, then exchanged at `POST
    https://api.nicejob.com/oauth/token` using `grant_type: "authorization_code"`
    to get a refresh token. The refresh token is then sent to the same token endpoint
    with `grant_type: "refresh_token"` to obtain an access token valid for 24 hours.
    Refresh tokens do not expire and can be revoked via POST to the revocation endpoint.
    Webhooks use `client_credentials` grant type instead.'
  - Scopes required for accessing review endpoints. The API uses scope-based authorization
    where the "reviews" scope is required to retrieve Review and ReviewInsights entities.
    Specific scope requirements are referenced but not detailed in this excerpt.
  - 'Scopes required: payments scope. The API uses scope-based authorization where
    the "payments" scope is required to access payment endpoints. Credentials should
    be passed according to the standard OAuth2 bearer token pattern in the Authorization
    header.'
  - The NiceJob API uses OAuth 2.0 with client_credentials grant type for authentication.
    Access tokens are scoped and restricted to permitted scopes that can be viewed
    in your app's credentials; each endpoint specifies its required scope(s). Unauthorized
    requests, including those with expired access tokens, return a 401 status code.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.nicejob.com/docs/reference/rest:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used for listing webhooks. The optional query parameter
    cursor (string) is passed in the query string to retrieve paginated results, with
    each response returning up to 20 items. Use the cursor value from the response
    to request the next page.
  - Cursor-based pagination is used for the List Invoices endpoint. The optional query
    parameter cursor is passed to retrieve paginated results, with responses returning
    up to 20 items per request. The documentation does not specify how to obtain the
    next cursor value from the response or when to stop paginating.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. List requests return a cursor field in
    the response which is null when no more results are available. Use the cursor
    value to fetch the next page of results in subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. The optional query parameter cursor is
    passed in the query string to retrieve paginated Case entities. Use the cursor
    value from the previous response to fetch the next page of results.
  - Pagination uses limit of 20 items per response. No explicit pagination parameters
    (page, offset, cursor, limit) are documented in the request. No pagination navigation
    fields (next, has_more, total_count) are mentioned in the response structure.
