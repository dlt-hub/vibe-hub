    endpoint: "/api/users"  # This is a placeholder endpoint
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # Add any query parameters if applicable
    data_selector: "$"  # Assuming the response structure contains the user data at the root

  - name: "orders"
    endpoint: "/api/orders"  # This is a placeholder endpoint
    method: "GET"
    params:
