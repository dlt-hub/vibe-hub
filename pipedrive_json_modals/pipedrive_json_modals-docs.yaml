auth_info:
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs:
  - 'Pipedrive API supports two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 for public or private
    apps, and API token authentication for integrations. Both approaches allow you
    to connect with Pipedrive''s RESTful API.'
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/getting-started:
  - 'The Pipedrive API supports two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 for public or
    private apps, and API token authentication for integrations. Credentials should
    be sent according to each method''s requirements as detailed in the OAuth 2.0
    and API token documentation.'
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/run-pipedrive-api-in-postman-or-insomnia:
  - API token-based authorization is required. Add your API token (obtained from Personal
    preferences settings in Pipedrive) to the `x-api-token` header for each request.
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-about-pipedrive-api:
  - Calls to the Pipedrive API are validated using an API token passed as an `api_token`
    parameter or an `access_token` when using OAuth 2.0. The API supports UTF-8 character
    encoding.
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-authentication:
  - All requests require authentication via either OAuth 2.0 (for app creation) or
    an API token. For API token integration, include the token in the x-api-token
    header for all requests. The API token is user and company-specific, with only
    one active token allowed per user at any time.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-pagination:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used for v2 API list endpoints and specific v1 collection
    endpoints. Use the cursor query parameter to navigate results, with the next cursor
    value returned in the response used for subsequent requests. Pagination ends when
    no next cursor is returned.
  - Cursor-based pagination uses `cursor` (opaque string marker for next page's first
    item) and `limit` (number of entities per page, default 100, max 500) as query
    parameters. The response includes `next_cursor` in the `additional_data` object;
    when `next_cursor` is null, pagination has ended.
  - Offset-based pagination uses query parameters start (integer, optional, default
    0) and limit (integer, optional, default 100, maximum 500) to control pagination.
    The response includes additional_data.pagination with start, limit, more_items_in_collection
    flag, and next_start field; when more_items_in_collection is true, use next_start
    value as the start parameter for the next request.
- information_source; https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/implementing-messaging-app-extension:
  - Pagination uses cursors. The getConversations endpoint returns a next_messages_cursor
    property that Pipedrive stores and sends back as a query parameter when calling
    getConversationById. The application sends an after cursor property in the additional_data
    object to fetch more conversations in subsequent requests using the same endpoint.
