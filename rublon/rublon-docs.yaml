auth_info:
- information_source; https://rublon.com/doc/rest-api/:
  - API requests to Rublon require two authentication mechanisms. First, include your
    system token in the request body as the "systemToken" field. Second, generate
    an X-Rublon-Signature header by signing the request (signature generation method
    not specified in this excerpt). Additionally, after user MFA completion, use the
    access token returned in the callback parameter "rublonToken" along with the system
    token to finalize the transaction via the /api/transaction/credentials endpoint.
  - 'Requests to this endpoint require two authentication credentials in the request:


    1. systemToken in the JSON request body: a 32-character hex string (example: "F950953E5454435B9A59E3125F9E7879")

    2. X-Rublon-Signature header: a generated signature that must be computed and
    included in the request headers'
  - Rublon API uses HMAC SHA-256 signature-based authentication. Generate an HMAC
    SHA-256 hash of the JSON request body using your application's secret key, then
    include the resulting hash in the X-Rublon-Signature header. The API will reject
    requests with a missing or invalid X-Rublon-Signature header by responding with
    InvalidSignatureException. Additionally, include your systemToken in the request
    body.
  - 'The API uses two authentication mechanisms: a system token passed in the request
    body as "systemToken" parameter, and request signing via the X-Rublon-Signature
    header. Additionally, an accessToken is required in the request body for transaction
    confirmation endpoints, which is obtained from prior API responses or from the
    TransactionConfirmedEvent. All requests must include Content-Type: application/json
    and Accept: application/json headers.'
- information_source; https://rublon.com/doc/admin-api/:
  - 'System Token and HMAC-SHA256 signature are required for Rublon Admin API authentication.
    Include three headers in every request: X-Rublon-System-Token with your saved
    System Token, X-Rublon-Signature containing an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the concatenated
    HTTP method, full URL, request body, and X-Date value (using your Secret Key as
    the HMAC key), and X-Date with the current UTC date in format like ''Tue, 15 Nov
    1994 08:12:31 GMT''. Also include Accept: application/json header to request JSON
    responses.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://rublon.com/doc/admin-api/:
  - The /api/admin/users endpoint uses offset-based pagination with a perPage query
    parameter (default 20, max 100) to control page size. Responses include a meta
    object with current_page, last_page, total, per_page, from, and to fields to navigate
    pages. The /api/admin/logs/ endpoints use cursor-based pagination instead.
- information_source; https://rublon.com/doc/admin-api-use-cases/:
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. Requests include perPage parameter (set
    to 100) in the body, and responses return next_cursor at the end when more results
    exist; insert this cursor value in the next request's body to fetch the next batch
    of logs.
  - Pagination uses query parameters current_page, per_page, and from/to range indicators
    in the response meta object. The meta object includes current_page, last_page,
    per_page (default 20), total count, and from/to fields to indicate the data range
    returned.
  - 'Pagination uses query parameters page (optional, defaults to 1) and per_page
    (optional, defaults to 20). Response includes meta fields: current_page, last_page,
    total, per_page, from, and to. Stop paginating when current_page equals last_page.'
  - 'The GET api/admin/users endpoint uses perPage parameter in the request body to
    control page size (example shows perPage: 30). The response structure for pagination
    fields is not documented in this excerpt, so pagination navigation details cannot
    be determined.'
