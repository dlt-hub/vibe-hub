notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- In order to ensure stability and fair use of Apilio, there is a number of rate limits
  in place.
- Each action is measured and - if necessary - suspended individually. The reason
  to limit the use of an action is to stop endless loops.
- 'Rate Limit: 10 runs in 20 seconds. The suspend time is 10 seconds.'
- 'Calling a webhook of any type: 60 requests in 60 seconds. The suspend time is 5
  minutes.'
- 'Any REST API operation: 60 requests in 60 seconds. The suspend time is 5 minutes.'
- 'Updating a variable or triggering a Logicblock: 60 requests in 60 seconds. The
  suspend time is 5 minutes.'
- Available log entries according to your plan with a maximum of 6000.
- You are allowed to create up to 150 elements of Devices and Tags.
- For actions, the limit is 500 of each type.
- You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum. As far as the law
  allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty
  whatsoever.
- Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract
  damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these
  terms.
- As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that
  are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.
- Authorization Header must be replaced with your own personal Authorization Header
  from Apilio
- You can only read out Boolean variables at the moment.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Exporting Apilio data into a Google Sheet at regular intervals for historic data
  storage
- Automating kitchen lights on and off using a zibgee light level sensor and a zigbee
  PIR sensor combination to detect motion with a 5 minute timeout to turn off lights
