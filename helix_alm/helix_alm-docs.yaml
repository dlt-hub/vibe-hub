  : - 'Access tokens are generated using a username and password for a Helix ALM project
      and must be included in the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme for
      subsequent API requests. Tokens expire in seven days by default, with expiration
      configurable via the Registry Utility, and are invalidated when the server restarts
      or the associated API key is deleted.


      Include the token in the request header as: Authorization: Bearer <token_value>


      The response includes an expiresOn parameter indicating when the token expires.'
    - Helix ALM API supports three authentication methods. API key authentication
      requires adding the api-key and api-key-secret to the Authorization header in
      the format "ApiKey api-key:api-key-secret". Basic authentication requires Base64-encoded
      username:password in the Authorization header as "Basic base64(username:password)".
      Both methods return an access token that must be included in the Authorization
      header for all subsequent requests except when listing projects or obtaining
      a token.
    - To authenticate with the Helix ALM REST API, use either Basic Authentication
      (username and password) or API Key Authentication (key ID and secret). API Key
      Authentication is recommended for security. Both methods are required for endpoints
      like GET /projects and GET /{projectID}/token. The key and secret are longer
      cryptic strings, and keys cannot be used to log into Helix ALM clients, allowing
      granular control over compromised credentials.

  : - 'Helix ALM API uses two authentication methods: Basic authentication with Base64-encoded
      username:password credentials sent in the Authorization header for token generation,
      and Bearer token authentication for all subsequent API requests. Access tokens
      are obtained via the token endpoint, expire in seven days by default, and must
      be included in the Authorization header preceded by "Bearer" for all requests
      except project listing and token generation.'
    - To authenticate with the Helix ALM REST API, use either API Key Authentication
      or Basic Authentication. For API Key Authentication, add the api-key and api-key-secret
      to the Authorization header as "ApiKey api-key:api-key-secret". For Basic Authentication,
      include username:password in the Authorization header. All subsequent requests
      after obtaining an access token require the access token in the header.
