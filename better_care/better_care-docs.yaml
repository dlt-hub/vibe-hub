auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.better.care/studio/supporting-content/api-connectors/:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Tokens can be set as variables and added
    to authentication headers. Alternatively, a pre-request script can be executed
    before each API call to retrieve an authentication token dynamically and set it
    in the request headers. Shared headers can be configured to apply authentication
    to all API calls within the connector.
- information_source; https://docs.better.care/studio/supporting-content/api-connectors:
  - Bearer tokens or username and password authentication can be configured as variables
    and added to shared headers or pre-request scripts. For Bearer token authentication,
    include the Authorization header with value "Bearer {token}". For username and
    password, use basic authentication in the Authorization header with base64-encoded
    credentials. Pre-request scripts can dynamically retrieve tokens from additional
    API calls and set them in request headers before each API call executes.
