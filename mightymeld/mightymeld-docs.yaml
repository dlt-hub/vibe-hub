notes:
- By default, the MightyMeld Scribe is hosted on our servers, so the code is processed
  remotely.
- You can also configure MightyMeld so that your code never leaves your development
  environment.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- MightyMeld needs to know where rendered JSX elements come from in your source code.
- Next.js versions older than 14.0.2 have a bug where the source locations are missing
  in some cases.
- SWC PLUGIN SUPPORT IS EXPERIMENTAL
- Many applications do not require this plugin. Unless you have been directed here
  by other documentation, you can probably skip these instructions.
- These instructions are for apps created with Create React App that have not been
  ejected.
- Many applications do not require this plugin.
- If you have not yet set up CRACO, we recommend using customize-cra to set up your
  app.
