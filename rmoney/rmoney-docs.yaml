auth_info:
- information_source; https://online.rmoneyindia.co.in/doc.b2capi/:
  - 'Access tokens are obtained from a Login API and must be included in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token for all subsequent API calls. The required header format
    is Authorization: Bearer <access_token>, along with Content-Type: application/json.'
  - 'The Login API requires four credentials in the JSON request body: user_id, password,
    second_auth (2FA password), api_key, and source. A successful login returns an
    access_token that must be included in the Authorization header for all subsequent
    API calls, plus a broadcast_access_token for feed connections.


    Request body fields: user_id (string, required), login_type (string, default "PASSW"),
    password (string, required), second_auth (string, required, 2FA password), api_key
    (string, required), source (string, required, enum "WEBAPI").


    Response on success (200): Returns access_token and broadcast_access_token.


    Subsequent requests: Include access_token in the Authorization HTTP header.'
pagination_info:

    offset (integer) specifies the starting position and limit (integer) specifies
    the number of results to return per request. The response structure is not fully
    detailed, but pagination is controlled by adjusting these parameters in subsequent
    requests.'
