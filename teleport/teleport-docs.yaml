auth_info:
- information_source; https://teleport.varjo.com/docs/api/authentication/:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Exchange client_id and client_secret for
    an access_token via token endpoint, then include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" for subsequent requests. Tokens expire in 3600 seconds
    and must be refreshed when 401 Unauthorized is received. The scope parameter is
    optional for defining access permissions.
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used for authentication. Request an access token
    by POST to https://signin.teleport.varjo.com/oauth2/token with grant_type set
    to "client_credentials", your client_id and client_secret in the JSON body, and
    scope "openid profile email". Use the returned access token in subsequent API
    requests via the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
  - Teleport API uses API key authentication. Obtain your API key from the Developer
    Dashboard after logging in and requesting it (issued within 24 hours). The API
    key must be included in requests to authenticate; see the "Using the Auth Token"
    section for how to send it in request headers or parameters.
- information_source; https://teleport.varjo.com/docs/api/manage-captures/:
  - 'All requests require Bearer token authentication. Send the `AUTH_TOKEN` in the
    `Authorization` header with the format `Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN`. Refer
    to the authentication documentation page for token acquisition details.'
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" when making requests to the API.'
