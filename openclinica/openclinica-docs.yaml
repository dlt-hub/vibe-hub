auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.openclinica.com/3-1-technical-documents/:
  - Different parts of the OpenClinica API use different security mechanisms. Session-based
    authentication requires programmatic login to /pages/login/login before calling
    the API. API Key authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with the API key as the username
    and no password required; the key is obtained via the getAccountByUserName API
    endpoint. OAuth requires registering an application to receive a unique Client
    ID and Client Secret, which should be kept confidential. Some APIs may also have
    network or firewall-dependent security constraints. Each API method is labeled
    with which authentication method(s) it supports.
- information_source; https://docs.openclinica.com/3-1-technical-documents/rest-api-specifications/:
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication with OpenClinica RESTful APIs. The REST web
    services rely on HTTP, SSL, XML, and OAuth 2.0 protocols to secure interactions
    between systems, such as between the OpenClinica Rule Designer and OpenClinica
    instances.
- information_source; https://docs.openclinica.com/3-1-technical-documents/rest-api-specifications/openclinica-restful-urls/:
  - These URLs do not support OAuth security authentication.
- information_source; https://docs.openclinica.com/oc4/how-and-when-to-use-apis/:
  - API users of OpenClinica need an authentication token to access API endpoints.
    Obtain the token by making a POST request to https://{subdomain}.build.openclinica.io.
    The documentation references a Swagger interface accessible through User > Administration
    > Web Services Information for endpoint details, but specific token acquisition
    parameters, header names, and response format are not provided in this excerpt.
  - Authentication uses OAuth2 bearer token flow. Obtain a token by POST to https://{subdomain}.build.openclinica.io/user-service/api/oauth/token
    with JSON body containing username and password fields. Supply the returned token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {authentication token}" for all other API
    calls. Tokens expire after 4 hours and are rate-limited to 2 calls per minute
    per IP address; excessive calls receive 429 status and should be retried after
    30-60 seconds.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.openclinica.com/oc4/how-and-when-to-use-apis/oc4-clinicaldata-import-crf-data/:
  - Use POST to {serverName}/pages/auth/api/clinicaldata/import/xml with multipart/form-data.
    Submit the XML file via the file parameter. For attachments, also submit a ZIP
    file containing referenced files; in the XML, set the item's Value to the file
    name for matching. The API returns a job that must be polled or checked via log
    download to review import results.
