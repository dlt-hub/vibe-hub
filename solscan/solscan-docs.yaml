notes:
- We are continuously expanding our coverage by actively identifying and integrating
  new programs while optimizing the data quality and depth for existing ones.
- Token data includes real-time price updates and historical price changes.
- Users can view detailed token analytics including holders and transaction history.
- The API allows real-time tracking of transactions and blocks.
- Refer to the SolScan API Docs for integration and technical support
- API key is required for access.
- Solscan has its own RPC with all the historical ledger data.
- Currently, we do not have plans to add the function to call the functions on-chain.
- Pro API requires API key for access
- API key is required for access
- Requires setup of API key for access
- Quantitative Address Labeling is used for tagging wallet addresses based on various
  parameters.
- API provides real-time data regarding transactions and balances.
- API key required to access the API
- Requires API key for access
- Requires setup of API key to access the data
- For technical integration please reach out to us on Twitter/Discord for more support.
- Solscan has switched to using Metaplex Metadata as the newest token standard across
  the network.
- 'After deploying your Anchor program, don''t forget to publish its IDL using: `anchor
  idl init -f <target/idl/program.json>` This allows tools in the Solana ecosystem
  to detect and display your data nicely'
- 'Benefits of being whitelisted on Solscan: Your programs’ info will be intuitively
  displayed in a detailed manner.'
- Redirect information on your app to Solscan as default blockchain explorer on Solana
  blockchain.
- Data on Solscan can only be tracked after 7/7/2021. Transactions before that date
  will not be included in the export file.
- If a timeout occurs, try choosing a shorter time period.
- Accounts on Solscan can be used to track wallets, transactions and more.
- Users can add and customise their favorite address on Solscan.
- Pro API documentation available for detailed endpoint specifications
- The Watch list is where they can keep track of their saved tokens/accounts.
- Requires setup of connected app in Solscan
- All endpoints will be migrated to Solscan Pro API V2.0 starting from December 1st.
- The Solscan Pro API delivers token price and Market Cap data with a 3-minute delay.
- The Solscan Pro API currently does not support testnet, and we have no plans to
  develop this functionality in the near future.
