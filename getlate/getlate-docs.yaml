auth_info:
- information_source; https://getlate.dev:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token. Send your API key as a Bearer token in
    the Authorization header when making requests to the Late API endpoints.
- information_source; https://getlate.dev/:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY is required in the request header. Send your
    API key as a bearer token in the Authorization header when making POST requests
    to the Late API.'
- information_source; https://getlate.dev/ayrshare-vs-late:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY> sent in the Authorization header. The API
    key must be provided as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all requests
    to authenticate.'
- information_source; https://getlate.dev/blog/api-to-post-to-instagram:
  - Authentication must be handled server-side using OAuth 2.0 flow. Never expose
    App Secret or user access tokens in client-side code. The server should receive
    the authorization code, exchange it for an access token, and store the token securely
    in a database, preferably encrypted at rest. The `instagram_content_publish` permission
    is required for publishing content.
  - User Access Tokens are required to authenticate requests to the Instagram Graph
    API. Short-lived tokens are exchanged for long-lived tokens to maintain persistent
    application access. Tokens are passed as the access_token query parameter in API
    requests, such as in the media endpoint call where access_token={your-access-token}
    is appended to the URL.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://getlate.dev/docs:
  - Pagination is supported via query parameters page (default 1) and limit (default
    10, max 100) for the GET /v1/posts endpoint. Stop paginating when the returned
    posts count is less than the limit value.
  - Pagination uses limit and page query parameters. limit sets page size with default
    50, and page specifies the page number with default 1. The response structure
    for navigating pages is not documented in the provided text.
  - 'Use query parameters page (default: 1) and limit (default: 20, max: 100) to paginate
    through video clipping jobs. The endpoint returns jobs per page based on the limit
    parameter; increment page to fetch subsequent pages.'
