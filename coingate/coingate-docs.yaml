notes:
- To create requests within the CoinGate system the user should have an authentication
  token.
- For 'Test' (sandbox) mode you must generate separate API credentials on https://sandbox.coingate.com.
- Default limit is 200 requests per minute.
- Default limit is 500 orders per hour per business.
- Callback data is sent in POST method.
- CoinGate sends payment notification while your application returns response 200
  (OK) HTTP or 204 (No Content) status code.
- 'API credentials used in the wrong environment: Create separate users and separate
  API credentials for Sandbox (sandbox.coingate.com) or Live (coingate.com) environments.'
- 'Incorrect API credentials: Please check if you have entered them correctly; make
  sure that there are no spaces before or after the text.'
- Authentication is required for all API requests of the Payment Gateway.
- The only exception is the Supported Currencies endpoint, which is publicly accessible.
- The order is placed with the 'Create Order' API method.
- Payment callback (Payment notification) will be sent to merchant's callback_url
  when order status is changed to pending, confirming, paid, invalid, canceled, refunded
  or expired.
- The /checkout API endpoint is available only for selected merchants. If you would
  like to enable this functionality for your account, please contact CoinGate Support
  for assistance.
- A refund callback will be sent to the merchant's callback_url when the merchant
  refund is created or the status is changed to processing, rejected or completed.
- CoinGate callback sends the data when the send request is created or the status
  is changed.
- Retrieve a list of all supported currency conversion rates available on CoinGate.
- The Billing Service enables you to request specific payments from your clients.
- Billing Contacts are dedicated, billing-only customer contact records used for payment
  management.
- A callback will be sent to the merchant's callback_url when the billing request
  is created or the status is changed.
- The only exception is the Supported Currencies endpoint, which is publicly accessible
  and can be called without authentication.
