auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.citi.com/apidocs/account-reporting/statements/statements-api-reference/:
  - Authorization uses OAuth 2.0 with the client credentials grant type. The OAuth
    token must be sent in the Authorization header prefixed with "Bearer" followed
    by a space. The endpoint requires both Content-Type (supporting "application/XML"
    or "application/JSON") and Authorization headers.
  - 'OAuth2 with client credentials flow is required. Pass the client_id as a query
    parameter and include the OAuth token in the Authorization header prefixed with
    "Bearer ".


    Query parameter: client_id (your unique identifier from CitiConnect API onboarding)

    Header: Authorization (format: "Bearer {oauth_token}")

    Header: Content-Type (application/xml or application/json)'
  - OAuth2 with client credentials flow. Required query parameter client_id (your
    unique CitiConnect identifier) and required Authorization header with Bearer token
    format (OAuth token prefixed with "Bearer "). Token must be obtained separately
    via OAuth token generation.
- information_source; https://developer.citi.com/apidocs/:
  - Access tokens are valid for 1800 seconds with expiration time returned in the
    expires_in field. No refresh token is provided; request a new token either by
    monitoring expires_in or handling 401 Unauthorized responses. Most API requests
    require asymmetric PKI encryption and signing using a signing certificate (with
    alias in signKeyAlias field and password in signKeyPassword field), except those
    using V4 authentication endpoint which do not require signing encryption. Include
    the path to your local certificate in FileInputStream and the Citi encryption
    certificate path on your server.
  - Basic authentication is required, sent via the Authorization header as "Basic
    " followed by Base64-encoded credentials in the format "username:password". Additionally,
    mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication is implemented using a PKCS12 client certificate
    keystore with a password-protected private key, and the API requires X.509 certificate-based
    encryption for the request payload. OAuth2 client credentials grant type with
    scope "/authenticationservices/v1" is used to obtain tokens.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.citi.com/apidocs/account-reporting/balances/balances-api-reference:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with page_number query parameter (integer
    >= 1, default 1). The response includes a pagination-metadata header containing
    total_page property; increment page_number for subsequent requests until page_number
    exceeds total_page.
