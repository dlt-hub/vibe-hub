auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.axway.com/bundle/api-builder/page/docs/developer_guide/credentials/configuring_credentials/http_basic_credentials/index.html
  : - 'HTTP basic credentials use a username and password encoded in Base64 format,
      sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>".
      The credentials are constructed by concatenating the username and password with
      a colon, encoding the result in Base64, and including it in every request to
      the API.'
    - The basic credential type uses HTTP Basic authentication with Base64-encoded
      username:password. For API Builder services, the apikey is passed as the username
      in the basic auth token, and the credential is configured in the authorization.credentials
      object with type "basic", username, and password fields. The encoded value is
      suitable for use in an HTTP Basic authorization header.

  : - API Gateway OAuth supports authorization code flow (redirect URL must be set
      to {apiportal-url}/cb) and client credentials flow. External OAuth servers support
      authorization code flow only with public clients. GraphQL supports API Key,
      HTTP Basic, and OAuth as security mechanisms. SwaggerUI 1.x supports only client
      credentials flow for API Gateway OAuth.
- ? information_source; https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_connector/index.html
  : - The authentication uses OAuth credentials configured in Policy Studio, resolved
      at runtime based on Resource Owner Credentials (username and password selectors
      like ${oauth.resource.owner.id} and ${oauth.resource.owner.password}). On the
      inbound side, a security device must be selected for authentication, with an
      Invoke Policy security device recommended if credentials are sent by the client
      application. On the outbound side, the OAuth security device is selected as
      the Outbound authentication profile, with the back-end API URL dynamically assigned
      based on the Salesforce.com instance indicated after successful OAuth authentication.

  : - API Key authentication is supported by adding the key as a header or query string
      parameter as specified in the API's security configuration. SFTP Server Basic
      Auth credentials consist of a username and password pair. API Key or OAuth-based
      security is required for enforcing application-specific quotas on APIs.
pagination_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify_integration/page/docs/connectors_and_system_components/application_connectors/google_analytics/index.html
  : - Pagination uses the `start-index` query parameter (default 1) to specify the
      starting position. The response includes `itemsPerPage` (maximum entries per
      response), `previousLink` and `nextLink` (URLs for navigating to previous/next
      pages), and `items` (the actual list of results). Use the nextLink and previousLink
      values to construct subsequent requests.
    - 'The List Accounts endpoint uses offset-based pagination with two query parameters:
      max-results (maximum number of accounts per response) and start-index (index
      of first account to retrieve, default 1). The response includes totalResults
      (total count), startIndex (current position), and itemsPerPage (max per page)
      to construct subsequent requests.'
    - Use query parameters start-index (starting index, default 1) and max-results
      (maximum number of results per page) to paginate. The response includes totalResults
      (total count), itemsPerPage (page size), previousLink, and nextLink to navigate
      between pages.
- ? information_source; https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify_integration/page/docs/connectors_and_system_components/application_connectors/google_pubsub/index.html
  : - 'Based on the provided documentation chunk, I can identify pagination information:


      The ListSnapshotsRequest response includes a nextPageToken field (String type).
      If nextPageToken is not empty, it indicates more snapshots may match the request,
      and this token value should be passed in a new ListSnapshotsRequest to retrieve
      the next page of results.'
    - Pagination uses pageSize (query parameter, integer for maximum results per page)
      and pageToken (query parameter, string value from previous response). The response
      includes nextPageToken which should be passed as pageToken in the next request
      to retrieve additional results; if nextPageToken is empty, there are no more
      results.
