pagination_info:
- information_source; https://airdna.redoc.ly:
  - Pagination is implemented via a request body object containing page_size (items
    per page) and offset (starting position) parameters. The response indicates successful
    fetches but does not show response pagination fields; construct subsequent requests
    by incrementing the offset value by the page_size.
  - Pagination is passed via a request body object with page_size (default 25) and
    offset (both optional, starting at 0) parameters. The response includes a pagination
    object with page_size and offset fields to indicate current pagination state.
  - Pagination uses offset and page_size parameters in the request body under a pagination
    object. The response includes page_info with page_size and offset fields. page_size
    specifies result count per request (example shows 25), and offset specifies the
    starting position (example shows 0). Continue paginating by incrementing offset
    by page_size for subsequent requests.
  - Pagination uses offset and page_size parameters in the request body under a pagination
    object. The response includes page_info with total_count, page_size, and offset
    fields. Increment offset by page_size to fetch subsequent pages until offset plus
    page_size exceeds total_count.
  - Pagination uses offset and page_size parameters in the request body. The request
    body includes a pagination object with page_size (items per page) and offset (starting
    position). Response structure includes pagination metadata to indicate total results
    and current position for constructing subsequent requests.
