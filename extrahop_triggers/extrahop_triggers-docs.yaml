auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.extrahop.com/25.4/exa-rest-api-guide/:
  - API key authentication is required for the ExtraHop REST API. Users generate an
    API key through the Administration settings, and the key must be appended to request
    headers when making API calls.
  - 'API key authentication is required. Generate an API key through the ExtraHop
    system, then append it to request headers using the format "Authorization: ExtraHop
    apikey=<your-key>". User privilege levels are controlled by granted_roles and
    effective_roles properties returned by GET /users and GET /users/{username} endpoints.'
  - API key authentication is required. Generate an initial API key through POST /apikeys
    for the setup user, then use the API key to authenticate requests to the ExtraHop
    REST API. Additional API keys are generated through the API Access page in Administration
    settings.
  - ExtraHop REST API uses API key authentication sent over HTTPS. Each request must
    include a valid API key that is generated per user and authenticated before authorization.
    The API key must be added to request headers or provided through the REST API
    Explorer.
  - Users must generate an API key before performing operations through the ExtraHop
    REST API. The API key must be appended to request headers. API key access is controlled
    by user privilege levels including system, write, metrics, ndr, npm, and packets
    permissions, with varying full, limited, personal, or none access levels.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.extrahop.com/9.6/rest-api-guide/:
  - 'Pagination for the `GET /auditlog` endpoint uses optional query parameters: `limit`
    specifies the maximum number of log messages to return, and `offset` specifies
    how many log messages to skip, allowing results to start from the offset value.'
  - Pagination is supported via optional limit and offset query parameters. The limit
    parameter controls the number of results returned, and the offset parameter skips
    the first n results. These parameters are combined to navigate through pages of
    device results.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    the maximum number of results per request (required, type integer). The offset
    parameter specifies the starting position for results (optional, type integer,
    default 0). Response includes total field indicating total number of detections
    available.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters in the request body. offset specifies
    the starting position (default 0), and limit specifies the maximum number of results
    to return (default 0). Use from field to indicate the starting index. Stop paginating
    when fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters. The limit parameter (optional, default
    100, max 10000) specifies maximum records returned. The offset parameter (optional,
    default 0) specifies how many records to skip; for ExtraHop recordstores the maximum
    offset is 10000, and POST /records/cursor/ should be used to retrieve records
    beyond that threshold.
