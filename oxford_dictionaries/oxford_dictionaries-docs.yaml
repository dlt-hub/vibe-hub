auth_info:
- information_source; https://pub.dev/documentation/endpoint_core/latest/:
  - API uses Bearer Token authentication. The token is passed via the Authorization
    header (implicitly through the bearerToken method), with unauthorized status codes
    401 and 403 triggering an onUnauthorizedCallback for custom handling. The token
    value is set in the defaultAuthOptions parameter as "your-token-here" (replace
    with actual token).
  - The package provides an authorization interceptor extension method. To add authorization
    to all requests, use dio.addAuthorizationInterceptor('your-token-here'), which
    adds an authorization header. Additionally, custom headers can be added via dio.addCustomHeader('header-name',
    'value'). The specific header name used by the authorization interceptor is not
    explicitly documented in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://pub.dev/packages/meet_hour:
  - A token parameter is passed to API service methods (ApiServices.contactsList(token,
    ...) and ApiServices.editContact(token, ...)). The documentation does not specify
    how the token is obtained, where it should be sent in requests (header, query
    parameter, body), its format, or any token acquisition/refresh mechanism.
- information_source; https://pub.dev/packages/offline_sync_kit:
  - 'WebSocket authentication uses a token-based scheme where you pass a user authentication
    token and device identifier to the authenticate method. Additionally, REST requests
    support API key authentication via the X-API-Key header.


    Specifically: call webSocketClient.authenticate() with an object containing ''token''
    (user-auth-token) and ''device_id'' (unique-device-identifier) fields. For REST
    requests, include ''X-API-Key'' header with your API key value.'
- information_source; https://pub.dev/packages/rest_api_client:
  - JWT with refresh token authorization is incorporated into this REST API client
    package. Credentials are managed internally by the client through token refresh
    mechanisms, though specific header names, parameter names, and token acquisition
    flows are not detailed in this documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://pub.dev/packages/meet_hour:
  - 'Pagination is used for the contacts list endpoint. The request accepts three
    parameters: exclude_hosts, limit (default 10), and page (default 1), all passed
    as query parameters. The response structure for pagination fields is not explicitly
    documented in the provided excerpt.'
