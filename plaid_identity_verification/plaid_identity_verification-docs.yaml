  - 'Plaid API uses three required credentials for the /identity/match endpoint: client_id
    and secret (each can be sent either in headers PLAID-CLIENT-ID and PLAID-SECRET
    or in the request body), plus an access_token in the request body that is associated
    with the Item being queried.'
- information_source; https://plaid.com/products/identity/:
  - 'Authentication requires three fields in the JSON request body: client_id (String),
    secret (String), and access_token (String). These credentials must be included
    in every POST request to the identity endpoints.'
  - Use Plaid's API authentication by including client_id, secret, and access_token
    in the JSON request body. These three credentials are required for Identity requests
    to authenticate and authorize API calls.
- information_source; https://plaid.com/plaid-exchange/docs/authentication/:
  - 'API requests to this endpoint require three custom headers for authentication:
    X-PLAID-CLIENT-ID containing your client ID, X-PLAID-SECRET containing your secret,
    and X-PLAID-VERSION set to the API version (example shows 2021-03-26). These headers
    must be included in all requests along with the appropriate request body.'
  - 'Authentication uses username/password credentials sent via URL-encoded form data
    in a POST request to /users/auth_token. The response returns an opaque auth_token
    that serves as the access credential for subsequent requests.


    Required request parameters: username, password, institution_id (URL-encoded in
    request body). Response fields: user_id (opaque user identifier), auth_token (opaque
    revocable token string). Success returns 200 status with the auth_token in the
    response body.'
