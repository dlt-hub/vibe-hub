notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- A portal can be hosted in Esri's infrastructure or your own infrastructure.
- Supports developing offline mapping applications that work where network connectivity
  is unreliable or entirely absent.
- Two common workflows for preparing and accessing offline maps are ahead of time
  and on-demand.
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter does not yet include all the capabilities of the ArcGIS
  Maps SDKs for Native Apps.
- 'New to ArcGIS?: Learn more about location services, tools, and APIs in the Mapping
  and location services guide.'
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for Java is deprecated.
- An ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account is required to use the services.
- The Urban API makes use of the GraphQL query language.
- An ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account is required to use the service.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Users not directly interacting with our administrative or REST APIs may encounter
  query limitations.
- In instances where a query string exceeds 2048 characters in length, the query should
  be submitted as a POST request.
- Access requires an ArcGIS Developer or ArcGIS Online account.
- Requires an access token (API key or OAuth 2.0).
- Currently, map areas are only supported when using your own runtime app.
- You can create map areas using ArcGIS API for Python or directly through REST calls.
- Attribution can change frequently. Ensure it is up-to-date in your application.
- Displays Esri and data attribution text automatically for both basemap and feature
  layer.
- No additional attribution work is required.
- Spatial references define the coordinate system used to locate geometry for features.
- Server software providing GIS mapping, visualization, analytics, content management,
  and data hosting capabilities.
- Requests are compatible irrespective of the order in which the parameters appear.
- Responses are compatible irrespective of the order in which the properties appear.
