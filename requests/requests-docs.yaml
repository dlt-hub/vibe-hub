auth_info:
- information_source; https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/:
  - 'Authentication is performed using the `auth` parameter in requests. Pass an `auth`
    tuple or auth handler object to the `auth` parameter of request methods (e.g.,
    `requests.patch(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)`). Rate limit information is returned
    in response headers: `x-ratelimit-limit` and `x-ratelimit-remaining`.'
  - Basic Auth is supported for GitHub API authentication. Pass a tuple of username
    and password (or email and password) to the auth parameter in requests, using
    HTTPBasicAuth from requests.auth module. The credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header as base64-encoded "username:password".
- information_source; https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/authentication/:
  - Requests supports multiple authentication methods. Digest Authentication is available
    via HTTPDigestAuth class with username and password parameters. OAuth 1 authentication
    uses the requests-oauthlib library with OAuth1 class requiring app_key, app_secret,
    user_oauth_token, and user_oauth_token_secret. OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect are
    also supported through requests-oauthlib. Additionally, netrc file authentication
    can be disabled by setting trust_env to False in a Session object.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/:
  - GitHub's API uses Link headers for pagination with page and per_page query parameters.
    The Link header contains rel="next" and rel="last" URLs; use the next URL to fetch
    subsequent pages until no next link is present.
