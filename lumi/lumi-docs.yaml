notes:
- Uses Basic authentication with base64(user:pass) in the header.
- If the success field is 'false', the lead either did not submit correctly or Lumi
  already has this lead.
- 'Authentication: Basic authentication with base64(user:pass) in the header.'
- 'Important: If the success field is ''false'', the lead either did not submit correctly
  or Lumi already has this lead.'
- Basic authentication with base64(user:pass) in the header
- Error message associated with unsuccessful lead submissions
- The Lumi webhooks can be authenticated in a number of ways, the standard of which
  is by using an shared API token under the request header X-API-KEY.
- We can also support HTTP BASIC authentication as well.
- We check for existing leads by EMAIL and PHONE.
- The API supports webhooks for receiving updates on leads.
- Basic authentication requires base64 encoding of 'user:pass'.
- Basic authentication with base64(user:pass) in the header.
- Webhook authentication can be done using X-API-KEY or HTTP BASIC.
- The Lumi webhooks can be authenticated using a shared API token under the request
  header X-API-KEY.
- We can also support HTTP BASIC authentication.
