auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.weavy.com/blog/adding-an-ai-copilot-to-your-appsmith-app:
  - Weavy uses bearer token authentication. The API key must be sent as a Bearer token
    in the Authorization header. Additionally, the Content-Type header must be set
    to application/json. The API key is obtained from your Weavy environment and should
    be configured in the datasource authentication settings.
- ? information_source; https://www.weavy.com/blog/building-a-chat-app-using-weavy-and-telerik-conversational-ui-for-asp.net-mvc
  : - Authentication is hardcoded against the public Weavy instance using static JWT
      tokens with long expiry for demo purposes. After sign-in, a local cookie is
      set using forms authentication, which then enables access to chat functionality.
- information_source; https://www.weavy.com/blog/chat-url-previews:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the header "Authorization: Bearer
    {WEAVY_API_KEY}" for server-to-server API requests. For client applications, generate
    user-specific access tokens via POST to /api/users/{user_uid}/tokens using the
    API key, then use the returned access_token in subsequent requests from the client.'
- information_source; https://www.weavy.com/docs/get-started/web-components:
  - The API uses server-to-server authentication via the WEAVY_API_KEY environment
    variable, which must be set and available. The endpoint returns an access_token
    and expires_in for the currently authenticated user, with an optional refresh
    query parameter to request token refresh. The WEAVY_URL environment variable is
    also required to be configured.
  - 'The Weavy instance requires authentication configured via either a tokenUrl or
    tokenFactory property. The tokenUrl should point to an API endpoint that returns
    a JSON response with an access_token field in the format { "access_token": "wyu_*****"
    }, or alternatively use tokenFactory as an async function that returns a token.
    Additionally, a url property pointing to the Weavy environment is required. The
    tokenUrl or tokenFactory will only be used after a valid url is set.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.weavy.com/docs/reference/api/agents:
  - The `take` parameter (query string, optional, value between 1 and 100, default
    25) controls pagination size. Response includes `start`, `end`, and `count` fields
    indicating the range and total count of returned items.
