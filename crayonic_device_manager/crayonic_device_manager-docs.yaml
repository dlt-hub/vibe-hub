auth_info:
- information_source; https://crayonic.io/CDM/:
  - Secure APIs use OAuth2 and JWT authentication. Single Sign-On integrates with
    Microsoft Entra via OAuth2. RESTful APIs require these token-based auth mechanisms
    for access.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {api_token}" for all requests. The token should be obtained
    separately and passed in the HTTP Authorization header along with Content-Type
    set to application/json.
- information_source; https://crayonic.io/Secure%20Document%20Signing%20in%20CGW/:
  - 'API keys must be included in the header of all API calls and only valid API keys
    from registered hostnames are processed. The API supports three authentication
    schemes: OAuth1 with Digest Scheme using cryptographic signatures based on token
    secret and nonce; OAuth2 with Bearer Token Scheme supporting Authorization Code,
    Implicit, Resource Owner Password, and Client Credentials flows; and OpenID Connect
    Discovery based on OAuth 2.0 that uses JWT-encoded user information.'
