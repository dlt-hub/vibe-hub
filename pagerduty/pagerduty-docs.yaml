auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/02bb39b038412-start-an-incident-workflow-instance:
  - 'Authorization uses a token passed in the Authorization header. Send the token
    value directly in the Authorization header (e.g., Authorization: 123 or Authorization:
    your_token_here).'
  - Security uses API Key authentication. The exact header name and parameter details
    are not specified in this documentation chunk, so the auth mechanism is API Key-based
    but the specific header name (likely `Authorization` or `X-API-Key`) is not explicitly
    stated here. Scoped OAuth requires the `incident_workflows:instances.write` scope
    if using OAuth instead.
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/:
  - All endpoints require the X-EARLY-ACCESS header to be included in requests. This
    is a custom header-based access control mechanism for early access features.
  - 'The provided documentation chunk contains information about OAuth token expiries
    and their lifecycle, which is authentication-related. Here is the extracted auth
    information:


    OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow uses access tokens and refresh tokens
    with time-based expiry. For OAuth clients registered before October 30th 2022,
    access tokens and refresh tokens expire after one year. For clients registered
    after October 30th 2022, access tokens expire after 30 days, refresh tokens expire
    after 210 days, and a rolling refresh window of 3 years is applied. After April
    30th 2023, the new expiry settings apply to all OAuth clients.'
  - This documentation excerpt describes OAuth2 scopes that are required for various
    API endpoints. The API uses scope-based authorization where different endpoints
    require specific scopes like services.read, services.write, incidents.read, incidents.write,
    and status_dashboards.read. Clients must obtain an access token with the appropriate
    scopes to call these endpoints, with the token typically sent in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/:
  - Update `GET /incident_workflows/triggers` and `GET /incident_workflows/actions`
    endpoints to use cursor pagination. The documentation does not specify the exact
    cursor parameter names, response field names, or pagination mechanics.
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/f1a95bb9397ba-changelog:
  - The `GET /incident_workflows/triggers` and `GET /incident_workflows/actions` endpoints
    use cursor pagination. The documentation does not specify the exact cursor parameter
    names, request field names, or response field names for navigating pages.
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/d54514b5b003f-list-incident-workflows:
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, results per page) and offset (integer, pagination
    start position) as query parameters. The response includes a total field (null
    by default, set total=true query parameter to populate it). Response structure
    contains paginated array of Incident Workflows.
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/aa192a25fac39-list-actions:
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with optional limit parameter. Request
    includes cursor (query parameter, optional, obtained from previous next_cursor
    response field) and limit (query parameter, integer). Response includes limit
    and next_cursor fields; when next_cursor is null, there are no additional results.
- information_source; https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/977aea38ee804-list-triggers:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with optional `cursor` query parameter (obtained
    from `next_cursor` field in previous response) to request subsequent result sets,
    and optional `limit` query parameter to control result size per request.
