auth_info:
- information_source; https://devportal.scantrust.com/docs/build-with-scantrust/rest-api/photo-auth-api:
  - The API requires an app identifier passed in the x-scantrust-app header (a required
    string that will be provided by Scantrust). No other authentication mechanism
    such as API keys, bearer tokens, or OAuth is described.
- information_source; https://devportal.scantrust.com/docs/build-with-scantrust/rest-api/gettingstarted-with-rest:
  - The Scantrust Admin REST API requires a valid activated company account on the
    Scantrust Enterprise Portal and a user within that company with sufficient access
    rights. Authentication details and token information are described in the Authentication
    & Tokens documentation section.
  - User Authorization tokens are required for all REST API requests. A user with
    appropriate company account access (typically SCM User Role or higher) must create
    a User Authorization token via the Scantrust Enterprise Portal, then include this
    token in all API calls to either the staging endpoint (https://api.staging.scantrust.io/)
    or production endpoint (https://api.scantrust.com/). The token provides fine-grained
    access control over what information can be accessed.
- information_source; https://devportal.scantrust.com/docs/scantrust/tools-and-integrations/csv-uploader-script:
  - Users with 2FA enabled must use a UAT token to run this tool. The token serves
    as an authorization credential for accessing the Scantrust portal when two-factor
    authentication is required.
- information_source; https://devportal.scantrust.com/docs/build-with-scantrust/consumer/update-location:
  - API Key authentication is required via the X-ScanTrust-Consumer-Api-Key header.
    Pass the api_key value as the header X-ScanTrust-Consumer-Api-Key in POST requests
    to the geotag endpoint.
