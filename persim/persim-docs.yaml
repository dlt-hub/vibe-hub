notes:
- PersLandscapeApprox tends to be much faster than PersLandscapeExact, at the expense
  of approximate versus exact outputs.
- Uses persistent homology and persistence images for classification.
- The experiment distinguishes between spheres of different dimensions using persistent
  homology.
- Consider PersLandscapeApprox for faster but approximate methods.
- Landscapes must have the same grid parameters (start, stop, and num_steps) before
  any arithmetic is involved.
