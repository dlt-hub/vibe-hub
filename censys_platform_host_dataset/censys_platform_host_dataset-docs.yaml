- Censys data is for research purposes only and cannot be used commercially.
- Censys only scans to get information. Censys never tries to log into any service,
  read any database, or otherwise gain authenticated access to any system.
- Blocking connections from Censys' subnets prevents our scanners from indexing your
  services. However, this does not remove historical data from Censys datasets.

  to 48 hours after their last recorded observation timestamp.

- Built-in reports in Censys Attack Surface Management (ASM) allow you to gain insights
  into your attack surface.
- Enterprise customers can configure ASM to refresh all of your seed-related data
  every night.
- If your organization uses third parties to maintain privacy guards on registered
  Internet artifacts, ASM may encounter difficulty when trying to find your seeds.
- Censys recommends that you do not include Registrant Organization names and email
  addresses of third parties that your organization uses for privacy protection and
  registration upkeep.

- Hosts are a foundational concept in Internet security and the Censys Attack Surface
  Management (ASM) platform.

- Excluding an asset has a ripple effect. Other assets whose path includes the one
  you excluded are also removed.
- To effectively remove false positives, follow the discovery path back to the highest
  parent node you do not want and remove that one.
- CVE risks use a specific naming convention for identification.
- Rapid Response risks do not include CVSS scores or KEV catalog information.
- Not all risks are enabled by default because not all customers want all risk types
  enabled.
- 'By default, only CVEs that match specific criteria are enabled: CVSS Score High
  to Critical, Present in KEV catalog, Network Attack Vector.'

  your team’s existing tools, enhancing responsiveness to risks, and strengthening
  your organization’s security posture.
