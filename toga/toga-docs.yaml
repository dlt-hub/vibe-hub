notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Requires a full URL, starting with http:// or https://
- Pressing enter after typing a URL won't load the page without an on_confirm handler
- Uses Briefcase to run the testbed app in developer test mode
- iOS tests can’t be executed on Linux
- iOS tests can’t be executed on Windows
- GTK4 testing is experimental and only partially implemented
- Uses absolute paths for file management, utilizing pathlib module for path handling.
- This updates the handler to first try to load content from an existing config.toml
  file in the configuration directory, and then, if the file does not exist, loads
  the initial_config.toml file contents instead.
- On macOS, menus are tied to the app, not the window; and a menu is mandatory.
- Apps executed under Wayland on Linux environment may not show the app’s formal name
  correctly.
- The operating system may provide controls that allow the user to resize, reposition,
  minimize, maximize or close the window. However, the availability of these controls
  is entirely operating system dependent.
- While Toga provides methods for specifying the size and position of windows, these
  are ultimately at the discretion of the OS (or window manager). For example, on
  macOS, depending on a user’s OS-level settings, new windows may open as tabs on
  the main window; on Linux, some window managers (e.g., tiling window managers) may
  not honor an app’s size and position requests. You should avoid making UI design
  decisions that are dependent on specific size and placement of windows.
- A mobile application can only have a single window (the main_window), and that window
  cannot be moved, resized, or hidden. Toga will raise an exception if you attempt
  to create a secondary window on a mobile platform. If you try to modify the size,
  position, or visibility of the main window, the request will be ignored.
- On mobile platforms, a window’s state cannot be WindowState.MINIMIZED or WindowState.MAXIMIZED.
  Any request to move to these states will be ignored.
- On Linux, when using Wayland, a request to put a window into a WindowState.MINIMIZED
  state, or to restore from the WindowState.MINIMIZED state, will be ignored, and
  any associated events like on_hide() and on_show(), will not be triggered. This
  is due to limitations in window management features that Wayland allows apps to
  use.
- The use of icons on tabs varies between platforms. If the platform requires icons,
  and no icon is provided, a default icon will be used. If the platform does not support
  icons, any icon provided will be ignored, and requests to retrieve the icon will
  return `None`.
- The behavior of disabled tabs varies between platforms. Some platforms will display
  the tab, but put it in an unselectable state; some will hide the tab. A hidden tab
  can still be referenced by index - the tab index refers to the logical order, not
  the visible order.
- iOS can only display 5 tabs. If there are more than 5 visible tabs in an OptionContainer,
  the last item will be converted into a “More” option that will allow the user to
  select the additional items. While the “More” menu is displayed, the current tab
  will return as `None`.
- Android can only display 5 tabs. The API will allow you to add more than 5 tabs,
  and will allow you to programmatically control tabs past the 5-item limit, but any
  tabs past the limit will not be displayed or be selectable by user interaction.
  If the OptionContainer has more than 5 tabs, and one of the visible tabs is removed,
  one of the previously unselectable tabs will become visible and selectable.
- iOS allows the user to rearrange icons on an OptionContainer. When referring to
  tabs by index, user re-ordering is ignored; the logical order as configured in Toga
  itself is used to identify tabs.
- Icons for iOS OptionContainer tabs should be 25x25px alpha masks.
- Icons for Android OptionContainer tabs should be 24x24px alpha masks.
- OptionContainer cannot accept input focus.
- OptionContainer widgets cannot be disabled; this property will always return True.
- Apps that use a camera must be configured to provide permission to the camera device.
- The iOS simulator implements the iOS Camera APIs, but is not able to take photographs.
- Requires user permission to access location services
- Background location tracking requires foreground permission first
- When using the GTK backend under Wayland, the screen at index 0 may not be the primary
  screen.
- On macOS, app-modal dialogs will *not* prevent the user from interacting with the
  rest of the app.
- iOS and macOS do not support the use of variant font files.
- Android and Windows do not support the oblique font style.
- Android and Windows do not support the small caps font variant.
- An icon is guaranteed to have an implementation, regardless of the path specified.
- PNG and JPEG formats are guaranteed to be supported.
- 'Other formats are available on some platforms: GTK: BMP, macOS: GIF, BMP, TIFF,
  Windows: GIF, BMP, TIFF.'
- 'Status icons on GTK are implemented using the XApp library. This requires that
  the user has installed the system packages for libxapp, plus the GObject Introspection
  bindings for that library. The name of the system package required is distribution
  dependent: Ubuntu: gir1.2-xapp-1.0, Fedora: xapps'
- The GNOME desktop environment does not provide built-in support for status icons.
  This is an explicit design decision on their part, and they advise against using
  status icons as part of your app design. However, there are GNOME shell extensions
  that can add support for status icons. Other GTK-based desktop environments (such
  as Cinnamon) do support status icons.
- The ActivityIndicator will always take up a fixed amount of physical space in a
  layout. However, the widget will not be visible when it is in a “stopped” state.
- A background color of TRANSPARENT will be treated as a reset of the button to the
  default system color.
- On macOS, the button text color cannot be set directly; any color style directive
  will be ignored.
- The Canvas API allows the use of handlers to respond to mouse/pointer events. These
  event handlers differentiate between 'primary' and 'alternate' modes of activation.
  When a mouse is in use, alternate activation will usually be interpreted as a 'right
  click'; however, platforms may not implement an alternate activation mode. To ensure
  cross-platform compatibility, applications should not use the alternate press handlers
  as the sole mechanism for accessing critical functionality.
- This widget supports years from 1800 to 8999 inclusive.
- On iOS, style directives for changing the widget’s color and background color will
  be ignored.
- The WinForms implementation currently uses a column layout similar to Table, and
  does not support the primary, secondary or refresh actions.
- Using DetailedList on Android requires the AndroidX SwipeRefreshLayout widget in
  your project’s Gradle dependencies. Ensure your app declares a dependency on androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:1.1.0
  or later.
- The direction can be specified as an argument, defaulting to horizontal.
- An ImageView is not an interactive element - there is no on_press handler for ImageView.
- The default size of the view is the size of the image, or 0x0 if image is None.
- If an explicit width or height is specified, the size of the image will be fixed
  in that axis, and the size in the other axis will be determined by the image’s aspect
  ratio.
- If an explicit width and height is specified, the image will be scaled to fill the
  described size without preserving the aspect ratio.
- If an ImageView is given a style of flex=1, it will be allowed to expand and contract
  along that axis.
- Winforms does not support a text alignment value of `JUSTIFIED`. If this alignment
  value is used, the label will default to left alignment.
- This is not currently supported on GTK or Windows.
- Winforms does not support the use of partially or fully transparent colors for the
  MultilineTextInput background. If a color with an alpha value is provided (including
  `TRANSPARENT`), the alpha channel will be ignored. A `TRANSPARENT` background will
  be rendered as white.
- Winforms does not support the use of partially or fully transparent colors for the
  PasswordInput background. If a color with an alpha value is provided (including
  TRANSPARENT), the alpha channel will be ignored. A TRANSPARENT background will be
  rendered as white.
- On Winforms, if a PasswordInput is given an explicit height, the rendered widget
  will not expand to fill that space. The widget will have the fixed height determined
  by the font used on the widget. In general, you should avoid setting a height style
  property on PasswordInput widgets.
- The visual appearance of progress bars varies from platform to platform.
- On macOS and Android, you cannot change the font of a Selection.
- On macOS, GTK and Android, you cannot change the text color, background color, or
  text alignment of labels in a Selection.
- On GTK, a Selection widget with flexible sizing will expand its width (to the extent
  possible possible) to accommodate any changes in content (for example, to accommodate
  a long label). However, if the content subsequently *decreases* in width, the Selection
  widget *will not* shrink. It will retain the size necessary to accommodate the longest
  label it has historically contained.
- On iOS, the size of the Selection widget does not adapt to the size of the currently
  displayed content, or the potential list of options.
- Widgets in cells is a beta API which may change in future, and is currently only
  supported on macOS.
- macOS does not support changing the font used to render table content.
- On Winforms, icons are only supported in the first column. On Android, icons are
  not supported at all.
- The Android implementation is not scalable beyond about 1,000 cells.
- Table widgets cannot be disabled; this property will always return True.
- Although an error message is provided when validation fails, Toga does not guarantee
  that this error message will be displayed to the user.
- Winforms does not support the use of partially or fully transparent colors for the
  TextInput background.
- This widget supports hours, minutes and seconds. Microseconds will always be returned
  as zero.
- On Android and iOS, seconds will also be returned as zero, and any second component
  of a minimum or maximum value will be ignored.
- Tree widgets cannot be disabled; this property will always return True.
- Due to app security restrictions, WebView can only display `http://` and `https://`
  URLs, not `file://` URLs.
- On macOS 13.3 (Ventura) and later, the content inspector for your app can be opened
  by running Safari, enabling the developer tools, and selecting your app’s window
  from the 'Develop' menu.
- Eventually, the Toga project would like to provide support for WinUI, Qt, tvOS,
  and watchOS.
- toga-winforms requires Python 3.9+, and Windows 10 or newer.
- If using Windows 10 and wanting to use a WebView, install the Edge WebView2 Evergreen
  Runtime.
- Windows 11 has this runtime installed by default.
- Toga does not currently have a Qt backend for KDE-based desktops.
- Although GTK can be installed on Windows and macOS, this is not officially supported
  by Toga.
- The Web backend is currently proof-of-concept only. Most widgets have not been implemented.
- toga-textual should run on any terminal or command shell provided by macOS, Windows
  or Linux.
- 'toga-textual must be manually installed by running: $ python -m pip install toga-textual'
- If toga-textual is the only Toga backend that is installed, it will be picked up
  automatically on any desktop operating system.
- The dummy backend has no prerequisites.
- To force Toga to use the dummy backend, it must either be the only backend that
  is installed in the current Python environment, or you must define the TOGA_BACKEND
  environment variable.
- Toga’s default style engine, Pack, is a layout algorithm based around the idea of
  packing boxes inside boxes.
- An image format plugin consists of a converter class and an entry point in the toga.image_formats
  group.
- If publishing a plugin as a standalone package, use a togax- prefix.
- Toga can now define apps that persist in the background without having any open
  windows.
- Apps can now add items to the system tray.
- It is now possible to use an instance of Window as the main window of an app.
- The initial position of each newly created window is now different, cascading down
  the screen as windows are created.
- The API for Documents and document types has been finalized.
- Toga can now define an app whose life cycle isn’t tied to a single main window.
- The Divider widget was implemented on iOS.
- Commands can now be retrieved by ID.
- A MainWindow can now have an on_close handler.
- Dialogs can now be displayed relative to an app, in addition to being modal to a
  window.
- An on_running event handler was added to toga.App.
- The on_exit handler for an app can now be defined by overriding the method on the
  toga.App subclass.
- CommandSet now exposes a full set and dictionary interface.
- WebView2 on Winforms now uses the v1.0.2592.51 WebView2 runtime DLLs.
- Backward incompatible changes introduced in this release.
- Documentation for application paths was added.
- Toga is a new project - we have lots of things that we’d like to do.
- If this is your first time using BeeWare, we suggestion you start with the BeeWare
  tutorial.
- This tutorial only covers BeeWare's GUI toolkit, Toga, and doesn't cover any of
  the details of getting your code running on specific hardware platforms.

  services'
- 'UnknownFontError: Raised when an unknown font family is requested.'
- 'ValueError: If a user-registered font is used, but the file specified either doesn’t
  exist or a font can’t be successfully loaded from it.'
- 'ValueError: If you add a command to the app’s status icon command set that doesn’t
  belong to a MenuStatusIcon group, or that belongs to a MenuStatusIcon group that
  hasn’t been registered with the app as a status icon.'
- 'ValueError: An error will also be raised if you remove a status icon while there
  status icon commands referencing that command.'
