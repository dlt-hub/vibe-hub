notes:
- 'OAuth 2.0 scopes required: read:ops-config:jira-service-management, write:ops-config:jira-service-management'
- Announcing OAuth 2.0
- The user should have view permission for JEC
- Most operations in this API require permissions.
- Some operations provide support for anonymous access.
- 'Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the X-Atlassian-Token:
  no-check header in requests.'
- If Accept-Language requests a language that Jira can return, the response is in
  that language.
- IT operations management may not be a necessity for every team.
- Non-admin team members will not have the ability to manage on-call schedules, set
  integrations, and perform other admin activities.
- Basic auth requires API tokens.
- Authentication using passwords has been deprecated.
- Implicit grant flow not supported
- Site-scoped grants limitations
- Apps cannot declare searchable entity properties
- If Accept-Language requests a language that Jira can return the response is in that
  language.
- Precomputations not evaluated for 7 days are removed automatically by Jira.
- You can no longer publish Connect apps on the Atlassian Marketplace. All new extensibility
  features will be delivered only on Forge.
- Forge hosted storage will automatically include data residency.
- This implementation will provide your customers with greater control over their
  app data’s location.
- OAuth 2.0 (3LO) apps use three-legged OAuth, also known as OAuth 2.0 authorization
  code grants.
- Forge platform is built on a foundation of security, making it easier for you to
  create secure apps.
- It's recommended that you use less than 50 scopes in an application.
- When adding scopes in the developer console, a count of the scopes added to your
  app is displayed.
- Ensure to configure OAuth 2.0 (3LO) in the developer console
- The API requires the cloudid for requests
- Rotating refresh tokens issued with a 90-day expiry
- Basic authentication is not as secure as other methods.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Effective November 22, 2025, Atlassian will implement rate limits on API tokens.
- Rate limits will impact any applications, scripts, or integrations that utilize
  API tokens.
- Minimizing the amount of data requested will yield benefits.
- Monitor header responses to see where you are at with regards to limits.
- The maximum number of issues, including subtasks, that you can update at once is
  capped at 1000.
- Each request allows up to 90 accounts to be reported on.
- Profile visibility affects apps and the information that can be retrieved via the
  API.
- The Email API is a public API and only approved Connect apps can use it.
- In 2024, Forge hosted storage will automatically include data residency.
- Never store user personal data, any sensitive data or configuration information
  using entity properties or app properties.
- Jira expressions is a domain-specific language designed with Jira in mind, evaluated
  on the Jira Cloud side.
- Loading data this way is considered an expensive operation, and there is a limit
  of how many expensive operations a single expression evaluation can have.
- Only install the Developer Canary Program app in tenants used for development and
  testing.
- You can un-enroll and re-enroll the tenant in the DCP program if you wish to compare
  the behaviour of your app.
- Issue context modules are shown by default.
- Glance panels and right context web panels are hidden by default.
- Atlassian Connect authenticates apps using JWT tokens.
- Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large collection of items.
- The Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default.
- Methods marked as experimental may change without notice.
- 'Use of the header ''X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in'' for experimental methods.'
- Atlassian Connect add-ons use JWT for authentication.
- REST API supports OAuth 2.0 for direct integrations.
- If you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the REST API supports basic
  auth.
- OAuth 2.0 integrations cannot be listed in the Atlassian Marketplace.
- Atlassian reviews and approves new Marketplace app listings before they appear on
  the Marketplace, but new versions don't require approval.
