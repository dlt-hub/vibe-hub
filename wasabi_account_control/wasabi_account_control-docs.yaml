notes:
- Wasabi does not charge for egress or API requests, making it ideal for high-access
  workloads.
- This is the only time the API Key will be available and there is no way to retrieve
  the API Key after closing this window.
- WACM collects usage metrics daily at both the per-bucket and per-account levels.
- It is recommended that you rotate your API key periodically for security purposes.
- Wasabi Account Control API customers can manage and rotate their API keys within
  the Wasabi Management Console.
- The Wasabi Account Control API will rate limit the number of requests on a per Wasabi
  Control Account holder basis.
- To use the Wasabi Account Control API, you must contact a representative from Wasabi
  to request access to the Wasabi Account Control API program.
- The test environment will have API keys generated that are distinct from the live
  API keys.
- Information presented herein is subject to change without notice.
- A sub-user must have the correct policies assigned to access the AiR endpoints.
