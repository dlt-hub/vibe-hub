notes:
- The request body for quotation and booking requests is completely identical.
- For a quotation request, significantly less address information is mandatory than
  for a booking request.
- Minimum request parameters include product, shipper, consignee, and lines.
- Status updates are sent immediately after they are generated.
- A response of listing endpoints could include up to 50 results per request.
- To access more results the pagination has to be used.
