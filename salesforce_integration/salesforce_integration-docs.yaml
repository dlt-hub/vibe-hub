auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.w3web.net/tutorial/:
  - Salesforce REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Developers must implement
    refresh token flows to handle token expiration and maintain valid credentials
    for API requests.
- information_source; https://www.w3web.net/best-practices-for-salesforce-integration/:
  - Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the API token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" when making requests to the ERP API endpoint.
- information_source; https://www.w3web.net/interview-questions-on-rest-api-integration/:
  - OAuth 2.0 is the recommended authentication method for Salesforce REST API. Clients
    obtain an access token through OAuth 2.0 flows (including Authorization Code Flow
    and Username flow) to make API calls. Alternatively, Session ID authentication
    is supported. Tokens must be stored securely, and IP whitelisting and Named Credentials
    should be used to enhance security.
  - 'Salesforce REST API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication with four supported flows:
    username-password flow for server-to-server integrations, web server flow for
    web apps, JWT bearer flow for secure server apps, and user-agent flow for mobile
    apps.'
  - Salesforce REST API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Connected Apps define OAuth
    policies and allow external systems to connect securely. Authentication tokens
    can expire and must be refreshed using the OAuth Refresh Token flow. Named Credentials
    should be used to securely store and manage credentials for integration. Sensitive
    data should be protected using OAuth 2.0, field-level security, and encryption.
