auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiauthenticator/6.6.4/rest-api-solution-guide/704555/authentication-auth
  : - Basic authentication with optional two-factor authentication. Send a POST request
      with username (required), password (optional), token_code (optional), and user_ip
      (optional) in the request body. At least one of password or token_code must
      be provided; if two-factor authentication is enabled for the user, both may
      be required.
    - The API supports token-based authentication via a security token code parameter.
      Credentials are validated through a POST request using username, password, and
      optional token_code (security token) and user_ip parameters; the token_code
      field explicitly indicates "Supported token auth".
    - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication for requests. Credentials are passed
      via the `-u` flag in curl (or the `Authorization` header with Base64-encoded
      "username:password"). Additionally, the API validates user passwords and token
      codes via POST requests to the `/api/v1/auth/` endpoint, sending JSON payloads
      with "username" and "password" fields. Successful authentication returns a session
      cookie (sessionid) that is set in the response headers.
    - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a username and password pair sent
      via the `-u` flag (Authorization header). Requests to authentication endpoints
      require credentials in the format "username:password" encoded in the Authorization
      header. Additionally, successful authentication returns a session cookie (sessionid)
      that is httponly and can be used for subsequent requests. The API also supports
      token-based validation where a username and token_code are sent in the JSON
      request body.

  - 'Audit Log Purge API endpoints require Bearer Token authentication. The token
    must be passed in the Authorization header with the format "Authorization: <Bearer
    Token>". This applies to DELETE requests for stopping automatic audit log purging
    and for deleting audit logs before a specified date.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.0.0/api-guide/267041/api-methods:
  - Offset and Limit query parameters control pagination for workflow execution history.
    Offset specifies the initial index to start returning results, and Limit specifies
    the maximum number of results per page. Use these parameters together to paginate
    through results.
  - Offset and Limit query parameters control pagination. Offset specifies the initial
    index from which to return results, and Limit sets the maximum number of results
    to return per page.
  - Use the `$legacy_collection_view=true` query parameter to access pagination fields.
    The response includes hydra:totalItems, hydra:itemsPerPage, hydra:firstPage, and
    hydra:lastPage. In version 7.0.0+, the hydra:next attribute is omitted if no further
    results exist, and pagination uses hydra:view with first, next, and last page
    information instead.
  - Use the optional query parameter $legacy_collection_view=true to request legacy
    pagination format. In version 7.0.0+, responses include hydra:view with first,
    next, and last page links; the hydra:next attribute is omitted when no further
    results exist. Legacy format includes hydra:itemsPerPage, hydra:firstPage, and
    hydra:lastPage fields.
- information_source; https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/api-guide/267041/api-methods:
  - Offset and limit query parameters control pagination. Offset specifies the starting
    index for results, and limit sets the maximum number of results returned per page.
    Use offset to navigate through pages by incrementing the starting index.
