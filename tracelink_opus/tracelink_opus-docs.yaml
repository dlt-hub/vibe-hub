- information_source; https://opus.tracelink.com/documentation/preview/en-US/admin/Content/topics/api/intro_to_apis.htm:
  - All API calls to the Opus Platform require an Authorization header containing
    an authorization token. The Content-Type header must be set to application/json.
    Users should work with their TraceLink implementation team to receive the appropriate
    endpoints and authentication credentials for their environment.
  - Users must generate an API token prior to making requests, which provides a username
    (API key) and password (API secret). Both the username and password must be included
    in the request headers to authenticate successfully; these credentials do not
    expire and can be used for all API calls.

  - 'All API calls to the Opus Platform require two headers: Content-Type set to application/json,
    and Authorization with an authorization token. The specific token value and format
    must be obtained from your TraceLink implementation team during system configuration.'
  - Users must authenticate using an API token consisting of a username (API key)
    and password (API secret), both of which must be included in request headers.
    These credentials do not expire and can be reused across all API calls.
