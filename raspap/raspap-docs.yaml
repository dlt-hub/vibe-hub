notes:
- RaspAP is an independent wireless router project designed for embedded systems.
- RaspAP has developed a minimal write mode that substantially reduces disk I/O activity.
- Be sure to use genuine MicroSD cards from a reputable manufacturer.
- Card clones are common and hard to distinguish from legitimately made ones, but
  certainly not subject to the same quality standards.
- Intermittent SSID visibility may occur due to interference.
- Ensure that the 'vnstat' service has been set up correctly for data monitoring.
- For security reasons, your OpenVPN or WireGuard .conf files must have a Linux MIME
  type of text/plain.
- Windows ignores MIME types, relying instead on extensions.
- Be sure to test more than one client device connection with your WireGuard-enabled
  AP.
- 'The default administrator credentials are: Username: admin, Password: secret.'
- It is strongly recommended to change these default credentials.
- Bridged AP mode operates under some constraints as compared to RaspAP's default
  routed AP mode.
- RaspAP project has no affiliation with the supported VPN providers.
- The RestAPI is enabled by default in RaspAP's Docker container
- The captive portal plugin is available as an Insiders-only plugin.
- Starting the captive portal on an interface that's actively serving authenticated
  clients may disrupt their connections.
- The splash page is a standard HTML file located at /etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html.
- Uses a default configuration as a starting point.
- Optional components include OpenVPN, WireGuard, and ad blocking.
- It is strongly recommended that you change these default login credentials in RaspAP's
  Authentication panel.
- The API key must be generated and passed as an access_token in the HTTP request
  header.
errors:
- 'CSRF token error: usually the page could simply be refreshed to generate a new
  session token.'
- '403 Forbidden: Invalid API key'
- '400 Bad Request: Check the request format and parameters.'
- '404 Not Found: Verify the endpoint path.'
- '500 Internal Server Error: Check server logs for more information.'
