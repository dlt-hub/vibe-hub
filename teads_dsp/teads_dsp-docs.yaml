  - Limit offset pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies
    the starting element position, limit sets maximum entries returned up to 1000
    with default 100. The response includes count, next, previous URLs, and data array;
    iterate by updating offset using the next URL until no next value is returned.
  - Pagination uses marker-based navigation with limit control. The marker parameter
    (optional, defaults to 0 for first page) specifies the primary key of the last
    element from the previous page. The limit parameter (optional, default 100, max
    1000) controls entries returned per request. Continue paginating by using the
    marker value from the previous response in the next request.
