notes:
- Multi-Item Link allows end users to add multiple Items in the same Link session.
- Multi-Item Link is compatible with Auth, Transfer, Transactions, Liabilities, Investments,
  Bank Income, Assets, and Plaid Check Consumer Reports.
- Embedded Institution Search cannot be used in update mode.
- Embedded Institution Search sessions will not be reported in Link Analytics.
- Database Auth does not verify that the user has access to the bank account and does
  also not fully guarantee that the account exists.
- Database Auth is available for Auth flows in the United States.
- Users are more likely to select 'Pay by bank' if they understand that it will be
  a secure, open banking-powered experience.
- To support both populations, enable Database Auth for low-to-medium-risk scenarios.
- Payroll Income supports approximately 80% of the US workforce, including gig income
  workers.
- Payroll Income does not currently support the use of custom Sandbox data; only the
  default `user_good` user is compatible with Sandbox Payroll Income.
- Bank Income allows you to instantly retrieve net income information from a user-connected
  bank account.
- Document Income allows retrieval of gross and/or net income information via user-uploaded
  documents.
- Fraud Risk detection is an optional feature using AI-powered analysis.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Plaid
