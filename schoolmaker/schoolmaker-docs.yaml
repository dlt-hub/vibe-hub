    -> Integration & API in your SchoolMaker account. The API key must be sent as
    a Bearer token in the Authorization header with each request.


    To authenticate, add the header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY, where YOUR_API_KEY
    is replaced with your actual API key retrieved from the SchoolMaker dashboard.
    API access is available only to Pro and Business plan subscribers.'

    in all requests with the format "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", where YOUR_API_KEY
    is your actual API key value.'
