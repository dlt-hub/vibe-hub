  auth: To authenticate, you need to use an API key, which can be copied into the
    "API Auth" action in Make, and the required headers are `x-rapidapi-key` for RapidAPI
    and `x-apiroad-key` for APIRoad, usually placed in the "Authentication" tab of
    the Make.com HTTP module for easier re-use.
