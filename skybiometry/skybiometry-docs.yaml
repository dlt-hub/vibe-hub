auth_info:
- information_source; https://skybiometry.com/documentation/:
  - 'API authentication uses two required parameters: api_key and api_secret, passed
    as query parameters in the request URL. Both parameters must be included in every
    API call. HTTPS is recommended for enhanced security by changing http to https
    in the method invocation.'
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: api_key and api_secret sent as query
    parameters in HTTP requests to api.skybiometry.com/fc/. Alternatively, api_secret
    can be omitted by using domain authentication, which is useful when the application
    creator does not want to expose the secret key to end users. HTTPS is available
    for more secure communication.'
