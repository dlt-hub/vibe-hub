auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0/artists:
  - The API requires a client_id parameter to be passed in the request. This client_id
    is provided to you and must be included as a query parameter in all API calls
    (e.g., client_id=your_client_id).
  - client_id is a required parameter for API requests. Pass it as a query parameter
    in the request URL.
- information_source; https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0/artists/albums:
  - The API requires a client_id parameter for authentication. This identifier must
    be passed as a query parameter in requests to authenticate with the Jamendo API.
  - The Jamendo API uses client_id-based authentication. Pass your client_id as a
    query parameter named client_id in API requests. No other authentication headers
    or tokens are required.
- information_source; https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0/authentication:
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is required for API methods that modify user data. Send
    a GET request to https://api.jamendo.com/v3.0/oauth/authorize with parameters
    client_id (required string), redirect_uri (optional string), scope (optional enum:
    music), and response_type (optional enum: code). Protected methods require an
    access_token parameter; the ''music'' scope allows writing user music properties
    like playlists and favorites, while some read-only methods accept but don''t require
    access_token.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0/artists:
  - offset and limit parameters control pagination. offset (integer) specifies the
    starting position, and limit (string) specifies the maximum number of results
    per request. The fullcount boolean parameter indicates total result count availability
    for determining when pagination ends.
- information_source; https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0/users:
  - Pagination uses offset (integer, position to start) and limit (string, max number
    of results) as query parameters. The response includes results_count in the headers
    to indicate the number of results returned.
