In this guide, we'll set up a complete Ecommerce API data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def ecommerce_api_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://api.ecommerceapi.uk/v1/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "brands",
            "countries",
            "payment-methods"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='ecommerce_api_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='ecommerce_api_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(ecommerce_api_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from ecommerce_api‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Brands: Manage brand data.
- Countries: Retrieve countries or specific country details.
- Payment Methods: Handles external payment methods.
- Business Details & Features: Get or modify business details and features.
- Custom Fields: Manage custom fields for different data entries.
- Webhooks: CRUD operations on webhooks and verify webhook configurations.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from Ecommerce API workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@ecommerce_api-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Ecommerce API support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:ecommerce_api duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Ecommerce API API, as specified in @ecommerce_api-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "brands" and "countries" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in ecommerce_api_pipeline.py and name the pipeline ecommerce_api_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python ecommerce_api_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Uses Basic Authentication with Base64 encoding. The 'Authorization' header should contain the Base64 encoded credentials. The auth type is Bearer, but it follows the Basic Auth flow.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.ecommerceapi.uk/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python ecommerce_api_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline ecommerce_api load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset ecommerce_api_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/ecommerce_api.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline ecommerce_api_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("ecommerce_api_pipeline").dataset()
   # get brands table as Pandas frame
   data.brands.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Ensure correct encoding of credentials for Basic Auth. Pagination is cursor-based, not page-based, which might require handling the 'next' URL from response payloads for full data traversal.
