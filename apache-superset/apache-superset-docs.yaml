notes:
- Elasticsearch has a default limit of 10000 rows.
- The schema is not necessary in the connection string, as it is defined per table/query.
- Make sure the user has privileges to access and use all required databases/schemas/tables/views/warehouses.
- Admin must inform Superset what engine they want to connect to via /available endpoint.
- 'Superset is Not a Database Firewall: Superset''s built-in checks provide a layer
  of protection but cannot guarantee complete security against all database-level
  threats.'
- 'Configuration is Key: The effectiveness of Superset''s safeguards heavily depends
  on proper configuration by the Superset administrator.'
- Superset needs the style-src unsafe-inline CSP directive in order to operate.
- Only scripts marked with a nonce can be loaded and executed.
- 'Some dashboards load images using data URIs and require data: in their img-src.'
- MapBox charts use workers and need to connect to MapBox servers in addition to the
  Superset origin.
- Cartodiagram charts request map data from external resources that can be edited
  by users.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Increase the limit on your cluster.'
- 'CSP policy not found: Superset will issue a warning with the security risks.'
