auth_info:
- information_source; https://bookstack.bassopaolo.com/api/docs:
  - API Token authentication is required. Users must have the "Access System API"
    permission enabled on their role. Generate a Token ID and Token Secret from the
    user profile, then send them in the Authorization header as "Token <token_id>:<token_secret>".
    Content access is restricted by the user's assigned roles and permissions.
  - 'Token-based authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization
    header using the format "Authorization: Token <client_id>:<client_secret>" where
    client_id and client_secret are colon-separated values. Alternatively, if already
    logged into the system via a user account with API permissions in a browser, existing
    session cookies will be accepted.'

- information_source; https://bookstack.bassopaolo.com/api/docs:

    a data array with search results; note that actual results may be up to 4x the
    requested count value. Use the page parameter to iterate through results, incrementing
