auth_info:
- information_source; https://wiremock.org/docs/jwt/:
  - The documentation describes how to serve a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint for
    RS256 JWT verification by including a stub with the response body `{{{jwks}}}`
    with templating enabled. This allows clients to fetch the public key needed to
    verify RS256-signed tokens.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://wiremock.org/docs/standalone/admin-api-reference/:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with limit (query parameter, integer, max
    results to return) and offset (query parameter, integer, start index). The response
    includes a meta.total field indicating total results available. Construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the offset parameter.
