auth_info:
- ? information_source; https://developer.fiserv.com/product/CardPointe/docs/?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md
  : - Authorization uses Base64-encoded API credentials sent in the Authorization
      header. The merchantid (MID) is also required and is typically sent in the request
      body. Set the {{Authorization}} environment variable to your Base64-encoded
      credentials and {{merchid}} to your merchant ID.
    - Basic authentication is required. Send a PUT request to /cardconnect/rest/auth
      with an Authorization header containing "Basic" followed by base64-encoded credentials.
      The request body must include merchid, account, accttype, amount, ecomind, and
      capture fields as JSON.
    - The CardPointe Gateway API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials must
      be base64-encoded and sent in the Authorization header as "Basic {base64-encoded
      credentials}" for all requests, including authorization requests to the /cardconnect/rest/auth
      endpoint.

  : - API key and HMAC-based authentication required. Send Api-Key header with your
      API key, set Auth-Token-Type header to HMAC, include Timestamp header with current
      time in milliseconds, and provide Authorization header with HMAC-computed value.
      Also include Client-Request-Id header for request tracking.
    - Commerce Hub APIs authenticate using an API key. Requests must include merchantId
      and terminalId as client identifiers in the merchantDetails. The documentation
      references REST authentication with API keys and mentions different environments
      for development, testing, and production, but does not explicitly specify the
      exact header name, parameter name, or format for sending the API key in requests.
