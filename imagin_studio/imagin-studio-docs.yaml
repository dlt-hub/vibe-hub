notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in IMAGIN.studio
- 'For our images as well as our JSON APIs we set the following CORS headers: Access-Control-Allow-Headers:
  *, Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
  *, Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *.'
- Providing your data streamlines the process, ensuring seamless mapping, prioritized
  image selection, and an ever-evolving service.
- Images may only be used straight from our CDN by using one of the available APIs.
- The more data points you supply in your requests, the more accurate the returned
  content will be.
- The platform handles many different scenarios for image creation and delivery.
- Understanding response headers can help troubleshoot issues related to unexpected
  image delivery.
- Add the Authorization header to your request with the value 'Basic ' followed by
  the Base64-encoded string of your 'customerId:customerSecret' combination.
- The customerId and customerSecret can be found in the dashboard.
