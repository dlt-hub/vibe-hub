  : - 'Two authentication methods are available: cookies or token-based authentication.
      Tokens are generated after successful login, expire after 20 minutes, and must
      be sent in subsequent API requests. The login endpoint accepts credentials and
      returns a token that should be stored for reuse until expiration, after which
      a new token must be obtained by calling login again.'

  : - 'The API requires token-based authentication with company identification. Authentication
      is performed via a login endpoint that returns a Token and CompanyId, which
      must then be included in subsequent requests. For authenticated requests, include
      the following HTTP headers: httpheader.Authorization (the token from login),
      httpheader.CompanyId (the company identifier), and httpheader.content-type set
      to application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8. Tokens have limited lifespan
      and must be refreshed upon expiration through repeated login calls or by validating
      token validity before refresh.'
    - Token-based authentication is required. Tokens are obtained via login and expire
      after 20 minutes, requiring renewal for continued access. Tokens should be stored
      in BizStore for management across multiple integration scenarios.
