auth_info:
- information_source; http://man.hubwiz.com/docset/Chef.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/docs.chef.io/auth.html:
  - Chef Server API uses RSA-based request signing for authentication. Each request
    requires an Authorization header with the format "Chef VERSION" followed by a
    signature computed from the request method, path, body, and timestamp, signed
    with the client's private key. The signature is Base64-encoded and includes the
    client name. Required headers are Authorization (containing the signature), X-Ops-Timestamp,
    X-Ops-UserId (client name), X-Ops-Sign (algorithm identifier), and X-Ops-Content-Hash
    (SHA1 hash of request body). Requests must target organization-specific endpoints
    using the path pattern /organizations/ORG_NAME.
  - The Chef client authenticates to the Chef server using client key-based authentication.
    The config.rb file specifies the node_name (username), client_key path (private
    key file in PEM format), and chef_server_url. Credentials are loaded from environment
    variables OPSCODE_USER, USER, HOME, and ORGNAME, with the validation_client_name
    and validation_key used for node registration. The client key is typically stored
    at ~/.chef/{user}.pem and the validation key at ~/.chef/{orgname}-validator.pem.
- information_source; https://docs.chef.io/automate/api/:
  - 'Authorization is managed through Chef Automate''s role-based access control (RBAC)
    system. Specific authorization actions are required for different operations:
    "infra:nodeManagers:list" for searching nodes and "infra:nodeManagers:rerun" for
    connecting to a node manager. These actions are enforced server-side and do not
    require explicit credentials in individual API requests; authentication is handled
    through the Chef Automate session or API token established with the main API endpoint.'
  - Authorization is required with the action compliance:reports:list. This indicates
    role-based access control where the authenticated user must have permissions for
    the "compliance:reports:list" action to export reports.
- information_source; https://docs.chef.io/release_notes_automate/:
  - Authorization coverage has been added to all public API endpoints. The introspection
    API endpoint at GET /admin/introspect allows checking current user permissions
    on HTTP endpoints exposed by the Automate 2 gateway, and individual endpoints
    can be checked via HTTP POST by passing the endpoint path as a JSON body with
    the field "path".
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.chef.io/automate/api/:
  - Pagination uses page_number (integer, zero-indexed origin) and size (integer,
    maximum page size) parameters in the request body. Default limit is 100 results
    per response.
  - Pagination uses query parameters pagination.page (integer, page number) and pagination.size
    (integer, amount per page). The NodeExport endpoint explicitly does not support
    pagination.
  - 'Pagination uses query/body parameters: page (integer, 0-indexed offset) and per_page
    (integer, number of results per page). Response includes control_elements array;
    continue paginating by incrementing page parameter until fewer results than per_page
    are returned.'
  - Request body includes page (integer, 0-indexed) and per_page (integer, number
    of results per page) parameters for pagination. Maximum 100 results allowed; sum
    of from+size must be less than 100, with default 10 results returned per request.
    Response structure not explicitly detailed for pagination fields like next or
    has_more.
  - The API supports pagination through query parameters page (integer, default 0)
    and per_page (integer) in the request body. However, the documentation explicitly
    states that this endpoint "Supports filtering, but not pagination or sorting,"
    indicating pagination parameters may be present but are not functionally supported
    for this specific endpoint.
