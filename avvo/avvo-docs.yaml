client:
  auth: To authenticate with the Avvo API, you need to use OAuth2, requiring a client
    ID and a client secret, which you can obtain from registering your app; you should
    include these in your POST request to the token URL along with the redirect URI.
  most_recurring_base_url: https://api.avvo.com
  paginator: Pagination is required and can be applied using the `page` and `per_page`
    parameters, with supported methods including page-based pagination; a page size
    is required and can be specified with the `per_page` parameter, and the default
    page size is 10 (as seen in the first two snippets), while the maximum page size
    appears to be 20 (as indicated in snippets seven and eight).
