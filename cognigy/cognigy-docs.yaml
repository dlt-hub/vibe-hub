notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires setup of account with LLM providers
- The Handover Providers section in the Endpoint settings was deprecated in 4.97,
  with removal planned for the end of January 2026.
- Some providers may require adding the settings manually, such as adding secrets
  or API keys.
- Importing Packages from a newer version of Cognigy.AI into an older version may
  cause unexpected errors.
- Cognigy.AI skips unsupported resources while importing a Package.
- Node IDs remain unchanged during the import to ensure that hardcoded links between
  Flows and Nodes don’t break.
- Extensions have a default 20-second timeout.
- Extensions can make up to 10 API calls per execution.
- The maximum run-time of a Function instance is 15 minutes. For on-premises installations,
  you can change this limit via the FUNCTION_EXECUTION_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME_IN_MINUTES
  environment variable in the values.yaml file.
- You can define a Function only in JavaScript or TypeScript.
- The maximum file size is 256 MB.
- 'API call quota: 1,000 requests per 5 minutes.'
- 'Cognigy products have three different ways to charge customers: for conversations
  processed, for concurrent lines for calls, and for knowledge queries and chunks.'
- Add a specific Yes/No logic within your Flow to confirm and reject an Intent or
  the Yes/No type in Question Nodes.
- Enable this setting to continue the main Flow after an attached Flow has been executed.
  Disabled by default.
- Determine whether the thresholds configured in the attached Flows are applied. Enabled
  by default.
- Cognigy.AI allows communication with the Cognigy.AI installation.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Protect your xApps from XSS attacks by taking the necessary security measures.
- Cognigy Live Agent is designed to work exclusively with Cognigy.AI.
- The maximum number of invitations to Projects per user per day is limited.
- Ensure consistent branding across different customer touchpoints.
- One AI Agent can have multiple jobs.
- You can add up to 100 Nodes in the Flow editor.
- You need to have access to a Cognigy.AI account.
- 'One of the following speech provider credentials is required for testing a voice
  AI Agent: Microsoft Azure Speech Services, Google Speech Services, or Amazon Polly.'
- Uses apikey as a request header for the OData API
- Uses API key for authentication
- Starting from Cognigy.AI release v4.65, the Single Replica Redis setup is deprecated
  and replaced with Redis in High Availability (HA) Mode.
- 'If you are using on-premises installations, make sure to perform the Redis: Single
  Replica to Redis HA Migration guide before upgrading to Cognigy.AI v4.65.'
- The User Menu provides access to various user-specific features.
- 'To open the User Menu, follow these steps: Go to the Cognigy.AI interface.'
- The Interaction Panel offers a robust interface for testing chat and voice AI Agents.
- Cognigy.AI offers tools to analyze and evaluate agent performance.
- Snapshots don’t include Endpoints, Intent Trainer records, Analytics data, Contact
  Profiles, Logs, Knowledge AI, or other Snapshots.
- You can create up to 10 Snapshots per AI Agent.
- You can store up to 256 MB of Snapshots.
- The Voice Preview feature supports only the Google, Microsoft, Amazon AWS, and Deepgram
  speech providers.
- Simulate, monitor, and validate AI Agent conversations to ensure smooth and reliable
  performance before deployment.
- You can run up to 10 Playbooks simultaneously.
- A Playbook can contain up to 50 Steps.
- API allows programmatic interaction and integration with existing systems.
- Custom Extensions can offer new actions, integrate with external systems, process
  data, and improve conversational scenarios for users.
- Knowledge Connectors that offer new integration with external knowledge databases
  and improve RAG capabilities.
