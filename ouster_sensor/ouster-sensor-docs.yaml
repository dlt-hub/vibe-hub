notes:
- The OSDome, OS0, OS1 and OS2 have a hermetically sealed unit, and are non user-serviceable.
- Use of controls, or adjustments, or performance of procedures other than those specified
  herein, may result in hazardous radiation exposure.
- May be required to configure the firewall to connect with the sensor and access
  sensor data.
- Please keep in mind NOT to use https:// as it will result in an error.
- Firmware version 2.x is not supported for OSDome. Minimum requirement is Firmware
  version 3.x and later.
- By default, the data packet format will be set to Single Return Profile for Firmware
  v2.5.0 and later.
- LEGACY data packet format will be deprecated in Q3,2023.
- By default, lidar UDP data is forwarded to Port 7502.
- LEGACY Data Packet Format is soon to be deprecated.
- FW v2.5.3 is compatible with all Rev06, Rev05, RevC, RevD sensors and Rev 7 OS2
  (FW v2.5.x or later required). For all other Rev7.x (OS0,OS1 & OSDome) sensors please
  refer to FW v3.x user manual. GEN 1 Sensors are NOT compatible with FW v2.5.
- Sensor previously rounded the timestamp to the nearest decimal value, this is a
  bug and has now been fixed to output fractional decimal timestamp values.
- Lidar UDP data is forwarded to Port 7502.
- Firmware versions (3.0 & later) are only compatible on OS0/OS1/OSDome Hardware versions
  Rev7 and later.
- The values in the tables above are given for guidance only. The only specs guaranteed
  are the ones defined in the datasheet for a specific mode.
- When min_range_threshold_cm is set to 30cm or less, Ouster recommends setting return_order
  to FARTHEST_TO_NEAREST, especially when the udp_profile_lidar is also set to Single
  Return.
- Data policy has no effect on the User Editable Data field.
- Setting the udp_dest to “@auto” is only supported through HTTP POST /api/v1/sensor/config.
- Parameter udp_ip has been deprecated in firmware v2.4, please use the udp_dest parameter.
- TCP API has now been DEPRECATED in FW 3.1.
- By default, phase_lock_enable is false.
- By default, phase_lock_offset value is 0.
- The max character length of a standard message is 80 characters; however, the Ouster
  Sensor can support non-standard messages up to 85 characters.
- '`nmea_leap_seconds` by default is 0, meaning this calculation will not take into
  account any leap seconds.'
- '`nmea_in_polarity` by default is `ACTIVE_HIGH`.'
- It can take up to 60 seconds to obtain an IP address from the initial power-up of
  the sensor.
- If your sensor IPv4 address is of the form `169.254.x.x` it is connected via link-local.
- If your interface IPv4 address is of the form 169.254.x.x, it is connected via link-local
  to the sensor. This means that the Linux self-assigned an IP address in the absence
  of a DHCP server.
- It is recommended that you unplug the cable from the interface prior to making changes
  to the interface.
- Please contact Ouster Support for assistance with internal errors and other alerts.
- After POST api/v1/sensor/config request is received successfully, the sensor will
  reinitialize automatically to make the new configuration active and the config settings
  are persisted across power cycles.
- Changing the PTP profile does not require reinitialization.
- Add the above required modification at the end of the existing file.
- Deleting or editing the default settings section of the ptp4l.conf file will result
  in an error.
- The default systemd service file for Ubuntu 18.04 attempts to use the eth0 address
  on the command line.
- Override systemd service file so that the configuration file is used instead of
  hard coded in the service file.
- If multiple interfaces need to be synchronized from CLOCK_REALTIME then multiple
  instances of the phc2sys service need to be run as it only accepts a single slave
  (i.e. -c) argument.
- Replace the default value with a lower clock class (higher priority) and restart
  linuxptp.
- Output of ethtool -S is vendor specific
- MAC errors may indicate cabling issues
- Internal system errors can be caused by processor overload
- iPerf can be used to rule out sensor failures, and quickly reproduce errors that
  occur when the network is under a high-traffic load.
- Without a HEATSINK-BASE, thermal performance decreases by an estimated 4°C.
- During Ouster’s testing process, we observed solar load reduces the maximum operating
  temperature by approximately 8ºC.
- The water ingress protection rating for the sensor is only valid if the I/O cable
  is plugged into the panel mount connector on the base of the sensor.
- If you do not feel comfortable following the steps for mounting please contact Ouster
  Support.
- Bending the cable at a sharp angle directly after egress from the plug over mold
  should also be avoided.
- Without a HEATSINK-BASE, thermal performance decreases by an estimated 4°C
- The water ingress protection rating for the sensor is only valid if the I/O cable
  is plugged into the panel mount connector on the base of the sensor, and the locking
  collet rotated to the properly locked condition.
- A black shielding drain wire is included for convenient bonding of the braided shield
  as required.
- Sensor cables are not rated for running in any environmental air handling space.
- Do not mount the device solely from the top. The primary mounting attachment site
  is at the bottom of the device as it ensures adequate mechanical support and ruggedness.
- If you do not feel comfortable following the steps above for mounting please contact
  Ouster Support.
- If operating at cold conditions the peak power consumption is between 22 W and 28
  W.
- Peak power consumption is 28 W if operated at -40ºC for Rev7 OS-Dome, OS-0 and OS-1
  (-20ºC for OS-2).
- Ouster recommends use of power no less than 30W if using in outdoor conditions.
- The water ingress protection rating is only valid if the I/O cable is plugged into
  the panel mount connector.
- Do not mount the device solely from the top; the primary mounting attachment site
  is at the bottom.
- SYNC_PULSE_IN is a dedicated input channel that is accessible from the Interface
  Box.
- MULTIPURPOSE_IO can be configured as an input or output channel.
- The sensor cables are not rated for running in any environmental air handling space.
- Ouster recommends using a right angled connector cable for use cases wherein the
  cable needs to be bent within the first 5 cm between the connector and the rest
  of the cable.
- Both Legacy and Modular interface boxes are no longer available for purchase, it
  has been mentioned in this user manual for reference/information only for existing
  users.
- High Current Interface Boxes are rated 12VDC, 3.3A and 24VDC, 1.1A.
- Legacy Interface Boxes are rated 24VDC, 1.1A and supports all Ouster sensors.
- High Current Interface Boxes contain a user replaceable 5A low-profile mini blade
  fuse.
- 'Use only a Littelfuse #0891005 fuse for replacement.'
- Connector Boot Kit (Ouster Part Number 910-014733) will be shipped along with every
  sensor starting September 2022.
- 'Warning: RISK OF FIRE OR ELECTRIC SHOCK. DO NOT CONNECT THE GPS CONNECTOR DIRECTLY
  TO AN ANTENNA.'
- All Interface Boxes are suitable for use indoors only in clean, protected environments
  at temperatures between -20 °C and +50 °C.
- Interface Boxes are not designed for use outdoors or in environments that are not
  protected from dust, moisture, or high humidity.
- All Ouster sample data is provided under the CC BY-NC-SA license
- The Connector Boot Kit will be shipped along with every sensor starting September
  2022.
- Starting with ouster-sdk v0.11.0, most of core sdk objects have been moved from
  the `ouster` namespace into the `ouster.sdk` namespace.
- From 0.15.0, when iterating over a `ScanSource` object, it always yields a list
  of scans, even when the underlying scan source has only a single sensor.
- The Ouster SDK is currently provided as an early pre-1.0 preview. The APIs are subject
  to change in every release.
- Prior to version 0.15.0, SensorInfo was part of the ouster.sdk.client namespace.
- This namespace is now deprecated and will be removed in version 0.16.0.
- The performance of the SLAM algorithm depends on your CPU’s processing power and
  the ‘voxel_size’ parameter.
- The Pose Optimizer is a tool designed to refine the trajectory produced by a SLAM
  algorithm.
- Ensure you have a SLAM processed OSF file that contains the initial SLAM poses.
- Fields can be added or removed in a LidarScan.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- As of 0.13.0, the SDK is no longer compatible with firmware versions older than
  2.1.0.
- Official SDK support for firmware versions 2.2 and 2.3 will end at the end of June,
  2025.
- On Ubuntu, if you’re working outside a virtual environment, you may have to add
  `ouster-cli` to your path
- 'CLI command may cause: `No packets received within 1.0s`'
- This will be the last release that supports Python 3.7.
- This will be the last release that supports macOS 10.15.
- Following the steps will modify the sensor’s configuration.
- Multiple <PARAM> <VALUE> pairs can be passed this way!
- On Ubuntu, if you’re working outside a virtual environment, you may have to add
  ouster-cli to your path.
- 'Ubuntu UFW Firewall may cause: No packets received within 1.0s'
- The `--invalid-value` option defaults to zero.
- When using image coordinates for filtering PointClouds, valid ranges must be respected.
- Connecting to an Ouster sensor is covered in the Networking Guide section of the
  Ouster Sensor Documentation.
- Currently ply is the only supported format for the localization map.
- Bear in mind that following the steps will modify the sensor’s configuration.
- The slice command allows recording for fixed time duration.
- The value to replace the pixels that match the predicate. Default is zero.
- The pose optimizer tool can be used with the ouster-cli to refine the trajectory
  produced by a SLAM algorithm.
- For customers who know they will continue to upgrade their version of the SDK, we
  also wish to highlight some upcoming breaking changes.
- Next iterations of the Ouster-SDK is going to require C++17 standard at minimum
  to compile
- The shortform C++ init_client and Python client.Sensor() no longer have default
  parameters.
- The Python Scans interface timeout parameter has been changed from None to 1 second
  by default.
- The default timeout has also been changed to 2 seconds across the board.
- The module `ouster.sdk.client` has been renamed to `ouster.sdk.core`.
