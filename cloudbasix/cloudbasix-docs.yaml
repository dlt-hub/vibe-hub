  - 'AWS Signature Version 4 authentication is required. Requests must include an
    Authorization header with AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 signature, X-Amz-Date header (format:
    YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ), X-Amz-Content-Sha256 header containing the SHA256 hash of the
    request body, and SignedHeaders parameter listing the headers included in the
    signature (typically content-length, content-type, host, x-amz-content-sha256,
    x-amz-date). The credential scope follows the format AccessKeyId/Date/Region/Service/aws4_request.
    Additionally, the request body must include email, password (for initial admin
    user), instanceId (EC2 instance ID), activationKey, agreeToEula, and other required
    fields for instance activation.'
  - 'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication is required. Include an Authorization
    header with the format: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ACCESS_KEY/DATE/REGION/SERVICE/aws4_request,
    SignedHeaders=SIGNED_HEADERS_LIST, Signature=COMPUTED_SIGNATURE. Also include
    X-Amz-Date header in ISO8601 format (e.g., 20171115T202130Z). The signature is
    computed using HMAC-SHA256 over a canonical request including method, path, query
    string, headers, and payload hash.'
  - This API call uses AWS Signature Version 4 (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256) for authentication.
    The Authorization header must include the AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 signature with Credential
    (containing AWS Access Key ID, date, region, service name, and request type),
    and SignedHeaders listing the headers included in the signature calculation. Additionally,
    X-Amz-Content-Sha256 and X-Amz-Date headers are required as part of the signing
    process.
