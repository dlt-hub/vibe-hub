notes:
- API keys are unique to the customer and given at workstream/project level.
- Please be sure to keep your API access tokens secure!
- 'Use HTTPS Endpoint: To guarantee secure webhook delivery, exclusively configure
  callback_url with https:// URLs for TLS encryption and verify they point to applications
  solely under your ownership.'
- If Bucket_id is not provided, it will be assumed that bucket mounting is not being
  used and media has already been uploaded to CloudFactory through the Upload Media
  API.
- The API quota is the maximum number of requests to create task in the system (daily/weekly/monthly).
  Please contact CloudFactory support to increase the quota.
- Ensure that the Content-Type header is included in your request with the correct
  type.
- Skip Step 1 and Step 2 if using Mounted Buckets. Mounted buckets currently only
  support image assets.
- All database objects shared between accounts are read-only (i.e. the objects cannot
  be modified or deleted, including adding or modifying table data).
