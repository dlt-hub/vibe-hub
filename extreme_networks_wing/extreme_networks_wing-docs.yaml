  : - The WiNG REST API requires administrator account credentials for login to obtain
      read permissions, with fully privileged accounts needed for configuration changes.
      Authorization tokens must be included in API requests after successful authentication.
- information_source; https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/extremeguest/6.0.0/html-restapi/index.html:
  - 'Access tokens are obtained via an authentication endpoint and have a finite lifetime
    specified in the expires_in field (in seconds). The API uses HTTP Bearer token
    authentication: include the access token in the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {access_token}". Expired tokens trigger an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.'
  - 'Authentication uses bearer token scheme. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header with format "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all requests to protected
    endpoints.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required, passed via the Authorization header.
    The endpoint uses bearerAuth scheme for access control.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the bearer token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" for all authenticated endpoints.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/extremeguest/6.0.0/html-restapi/index.html:
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters page (zero-relative
    page index) and page_size (number of results per page). Both parameters are optional
    integers. The response structure does not explicitly show pagination metadata
    fields like total_count or has_more, so stopping conditions are unclear from the
    documentation provided.
  - 'The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters: page (zero-relative
    page index, integer) and page_size (number of records per page, integer). Both
    are optional query parameters. The response structure and stopping condition are
    not explicitly documented in the provided excerpt.'
  - 'The GET /v1/guestusers/bymobile/{mobileNumber} endpoint supports pagination via
    query parameters: page (zero-relative integer) and page_size (integer specifying
    number of results). No response pagination fields or navigation details are documented.'
