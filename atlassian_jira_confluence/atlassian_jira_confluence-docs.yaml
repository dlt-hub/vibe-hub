  : - 'API calls require an HTTP Bearer token in the Authorization header. Tokens
      are created via REST API POST to /jira/rest/pat/1.0/tokens and consist of a
      12-digit user ID and 20 bits of random secret, base64-encoded together with
      a colon separator. Include the token as Authorization: Bearer <token> in request
      headers.'
    - 'Basic authentication is used by sending a username and password Base64 encoded
      in the Authorization header with each request. The header format is Authorization:
      Basic <base64(username:password)>. OAuth 1.0 is also available as a more secure
      alternative, requiring application link configuration and OAuth library implementation
      with consumer/client credentials and authorization flow.'
    - 'Personal access token (PAT) authentication requires sending the token in the
      Authorization header with the Bearer scheme. API calls must include the header
      Authorization: Bearer <token> where <token> is the personal access token generated
      in Jira or Confluence. Basic authentication uses the Authorization header with
      Base64-encoded credentials in the format Authorization: Basic base64(username:password).
      OAuth 1.0a (Jira only) involves a three-legged flow where the application requests
      access, the user authorizes it, and tokens are exchanged. Cookie-based authentication
      (Jira only) uses session cookies set after login to maintain authenticated state
      across requests.'
    - 'Personal access tokens (PATs) are used for REST API authentication in Jira,
      JSM, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo Server/Data Center. Tokens are sent via
      HTTP Bearer authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, where the
      token is user-generated and inherits the user''s product permissions. Tokens
      can be configured to expire (in days) or be non-expiring, with a maximum of
      10 tokens per user by default.'
