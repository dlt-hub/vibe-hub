auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cs-cart.com/4.1.x/api/index.html:
  - CS-Cart API uses Basic HTTP authentication with the admin email as the username
    and an auto-generated API key as the password. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header using the Basic auth scheme (base64-encoded "email:api_key").
  - 'Each API request requires authentication using a user''s email and API key. There
    are three methods to submit credentials: via the curl --user parameter (email:APIkey),
    inline in the URL as basic auth (email%40example.com:APIkey), or as HTTP Basic
    Authentication header. The API key must be activated per user before use.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with email and API key credentials. Send
    the email and APIkey pair as a base64-encoded string in the Authorization header
    using the format "Authorization: Basic <base64(email:APIkey)>", or use curl''s
    --user flag with email:APIkey. The @ character in email addresses must be URL-encoded
    as %40 when used in the URL.'
- information_source; https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/developer_guide/api/index.html:
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required, using the admin e-mail as the login and
    an auto-generated API key as the password. User group privileges are defined in
    the objects themselves and control access to resources.
  - 'Each API request requires authentication using the user''s email and API key.
    There are three methods to submit credentials: via the --user parameter in curl
    (email:APIkey format), inline in the URL as basic auth (with @ replaced by %40),
    or in the Authorization header as a base64-encoded "email:APIkey" pair prefixed
    with "Basic ".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/developer_guide/api/entities/pages.html:
  - Use query parameters page (default 1) and limit (default 10) to paginate pages.
    The response includes total_count field indicating total pages available. Construct
    subsequent requests by incrementing the page parameter.
- information_source; https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/developer_guide/api/entities/products.html:
  - Pagination uses page and items_per_page query parameters. The page parameter specifies
    which page to retrieve, and items_per_page controls how many products are returned
    per page.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number) and items_per_page (results
    per page). The response returns a JSON object with a products array containing
    the requested items. Stop paginating when fewer items than items_per_page are
    returned, indicating the final page.
