notes:
- Requires setup of verified senders to send emails.
- API key must be set in the plugin settings.
- The call runs in the context of an admin user of the app when using an API Token.
- User receives a token that expires in 86400 seconds.
- A Twilio account is needed to send SMS in your bubble app.
- A Stripe account is needed to process payments in your Bubble app.
- Invite the developer with the role Admin to allow them access to the Stripe account.
- Authenticate your domain
- Add DKIM, DMARC, SPF verification
- Sendgrid requires verification of email addresses before sending.
- Postmark's free tier allows 100 emails per month per account.
- Standard workflow actions for setting up the template are the same regardless of
  the sending method.
- Canvas apps that are on v5.0 or older would not be able to upgrade your apps to
  v6.0.
- Admin portal redesigned with new features
- Page builder allows creation of HTML marketing pages
- Open the Chrome extension and click on 'App colors'. Here you can select your primary,
  secondary, and tertiary colors for the app. Select your new colors and click 'Update
  colors'. It will take Canvas up to 5 minutes to update the colors across all the
  styles in your application.
- If your version of Canvas is not the latest version, when you add a new page or
  block to your app it may contain styles that have not yet been added to your Bubble
  application. In this scenario you will be prompted to import the new Canvas styles
  to your app. It will take Canvas 5 - 10 minutes to update the styles in your application.
- Each Canvas application comes preconfigured with three headers.
- The footer element is included by default on all Bubble marketing pages.
- Canvas has a new system to help you add mail merge terms without typing them.
- The Admin Portal is accessed from the front end of your application (not from the
  Bubble editor).
