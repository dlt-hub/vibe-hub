auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.xverify.com/:
  - API key authentication is required. Include your `api_key` as a query parameter
    in all requests to the Phone Verification endpoint. The `api_key` is obtained
    after registering on Xverify.com. Additionally, a `domain` parameter configured
    in your Xverify settings must be included; requests without a matching domain
    will be rate-limited.
  - API key authentication passed as a query parameter. Include api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
    in the query string along with domain=yourdomain.com. Replace the example key
    1011111-B6DBE13C with your actual API key provided by Xverify.
  - API key authentication via query parameter. Include the required query parameters
    api_key (your Xverify API key), email (the address to verify), and domain (your
    registered domain). The api_key should be kept secret and is obtained from the
    Implementation tab after registration.
  - The API requires an `api_key` parameter for authentication. The api_key must be
    provided with requests and will be validated; invalid or missing api_keys result
    in a 401 Unauthorized response. The api_key must also be enabled for the specific
    service being accessed, otherwise an inactive_service error is returned.
  - The API uses query parameter-based authentication. Include the api_key parameter
    (replace 1011111-B6DBE13C with your actual API key) and the domain parameter (replace
    yourdomain.com with your registered domain name) in the request URL query string.
