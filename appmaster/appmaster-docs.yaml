auth_info:
- information_source; https://appmaster.io/blog/rest-api-best-practices:
  - 'Authentication in REST APIs can use several schemes: Basic Authentication sends
    base64-encoded username and password via the Authorization header; API Key, OAuth
    2.0, and JSON Web Token (JWT) are also commonly used. The documentation indicates
    credentials are sent via the Authorization header, but specific implementation
    details for API Key, OAuth 2.0, and JWT are not provided in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://appmaster.io/blog/rest-api-examples:
  - HTTP basic authentication requires a base64-encoded username:password string sent
    in the HTTP Authorization header. API keys can be provided in the query string
    or HTTP header. OAuth requires obtaining a credential from an OAuth server using
    a customer ID and optional customer secret, then sending the OAuth identity with
    each request. JWT involves digitally signed credentials sent in query or response
    headers to convey access privileges.
- information_source; https://appmaster.io/glossary/microservices-endpoint:
  - Integrating security mechanisms such as OAuth2 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) ensures
    that only authorized users can access specific endpoints, offering fine-grained
    control over access to sensitive information and system functionality.
- information_source; https://appmaster.io/university/tutorials/endpoints/what-is-swagger-and-how-to-use-it:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header with the "Bearer" scheme (format: "Authorization: Bearer <token>"). A 401
    response indicates the token is missing or invalid.'
  - Some requests in the API are restricted to authorized users only and require a
    Bearer Token for authentication. To obtain the token, use the POST /auth endpoint
    in the Auth section of Swagger by providing login and password credentials. The
    token can also be retrieved from the request headers of the deployed application
    by opening the browser developer tools (F12), sending an authorized request, and
    checking the Network tab Headers. The Bearer Token should be included in requests
    to access protected endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://appmaster.io/blog/how-rest-apis-work:
  - 'Use query parameters page and per_page to control pagination. page specifies
    the page number (e.g., page=2) and per_page specifies items per page (e.g., per_page=50).
    Example: GET /resources?page=2&per_page=50 retrieves the second page with 50 items
    per page.'
