auth_info:
- information_source; https://yepcode.io/recipes/rest-api-to-travelperk-employees:
  - Authentication uses an API key passed in the Authorization header. Set the Authorization
    header to Bearer followed by your API key value (e.g., Bearer YOUR_API_KEY). The
    API key should be stored in the environment variable TRAVELPERK_SCIM_API_KEY.
  - Use the Authorization header with the value "apikey <YOUR API KEY>". Set the baseURL
    to https://app.travelperk.com/api/v2/scim. The API key should be passed in the
    Authorization header prefixed with "apikey " and stored in environment variables
    TRAVELPERK_API_KEY and TRAVELPERK_SCIM_BASE_URL.
- information_source; https://yepcode.io/recipes/rest-api-to-travelperk-employees/:
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication. The Authorization header must be set
    to "Bearer {API_KEY}" where the API key is provided via the TRAVELPERK_SCIM_API_KEY
    environment variable. The header name is "Authorization" and the scheme is "Bearer".
  - The Travelperk API uses API key authentication. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header with the format "apikey YOUR_API_KEY". Store the base URL at TRAVELPERK_SCIM_BASE_URL
    and the API key at TRAVELPERK_API_KEY environment variables, then pass them to
    the HTTP client headers during initialization.
