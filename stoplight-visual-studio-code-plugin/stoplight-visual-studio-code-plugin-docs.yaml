notes:
- Users without git accounts can make changes to the repo.
- Allows for faster access later on, less mental overhead.
- Stoplight's first public-facing API launched in July 2023.
- Multiple Auth Parameters is supported by OpenAPI which requires, for a predefined
  security schema, multiple parameters to be set (such as an API Key and a User ID).
- The Try It component currently only allows up to 1 parameter to be set for a security
  schema.
- Currently the request maker does not have built in support for authentication schemes
  such as OAuth 1/2 or basic auth.
- For OAuth2 or OpenID flows, keep following our roadmap for updates.
- Easily translate your documentation by adding Localize to your Workspace.
- The projects list is where you go to find and manage projects in your Workspace.
- In a Workspace with lots of projects, being able to filter and sort is very important.
- Members list allows filtering and sorting by name, last active at, and account type.
- Now you can manually configure redirects for pages in your Workspace.
- A lightweight alternative to Git backed projects with a more traditional web experience.
- Share any project documentation with anyone, even if its Internal or Private.
- This feature is available now!
- Navigate to your workspace settings to enable this feature.
- You can now configure Google Tag Manager for your Workspace.
- Support for JSON Schema's readOnly and writeOnly in Studio Forms and Docs.
- This feature allows you to put the sidebar contents in whatever order you'd like,
  regardless of how they appear in the filesystem.
- Use Git branches to publish multiple versions of your docs.
- Workspace members will be able to view all project branches, while viewers and guests
  will only see published versions.
- Removes the 'Powered by Stoplight' badge and Stoplight metadata from your docs.
- Today try it requests fail if the API doesn't allow cross origin requests. This
  feature would pipe requests through a proxy allowing requests to successfully go
  through to APIs that don't allow CORS requests.
- We support bearer token in Try-it.
- The Try It component supports setting a cookie parameter when the cookie is defined
  in a security schema.
- Cookies defined as parameters on operations outside of a security schema is not
  supported today.
