auth_info:
- information_source; https://fusionauth.io/articles/oauth/modern-guide-to-oauth:
  - 'Authorization Code Grant is the primary OAuth2 flow for user-involved scenarios.
    It requires three key components: an Authorize endpoint (where users log in via
    browser), an Authorization code (random ASCII string returned after login), and
    a Token endpoint (API where the backend exchanges the authorization code for tokens).
    PKCE can be layered on top for additional security. Resource Owner Password Credentials
    grant uses username and password directly but should only be used with high trust
    or legacy migrations. Client Credentials grant allows applications to act on their
    own behalf without user interaction by obtaining tokens directly.'
  - OAuth2 Client Credentials grant is used to obtain access tokens for service-to-service
    authentication. Submit form data with client_id, client_secret, and grant_type
    set to client_credentials to the token endpoint. The client_id and client_secret
    can be sent in the request body or via Basic access authorization in the Authorization
    header. Use the resulting access token in the Authorization header with Bearer
    scheme when calling APIs.
  - 'The API uses bearer token authentication passed in the request headers under
    an auth object. The client sends an accessToken in the format auth: { ''bearer'':
    accessToken } to the /send endpoint. The microservice verifies the incoming access
    token via verifyAccessToken(), retrieves stored WUPHF tokens (accessToken and
    refreshToken) from the database based on userId, and forwards both tokens to the
    external WUPHF API in the same auth header structure. The clientId is ''9b893c2a-4689-41f8-91e0-aecad306ecb6''
    and clientSecret is ''setec-astronomy''. Bearer tokens are extracted from requests
    using the express-bearer-token middleware.'
  - The Introspection endpoint (an OAuth 2.0 extension) and UserInfo endpoint (OIDC-defined)
    are used to retrieve token and user information respectively. The Introspection
    endpoint returns JWT claims about the access token itself, including active status,
    granted scopes, and client_id, while UserInfo returns user information for whom
    the access token was issued. Both endpoints require network requests and accept
    an access token to return their respective information.
  - The WUPHF API requires bearer token authentication. Send the access token and
    refresh token in the request headers under an `auth` object with keys `bearer`
    and `refresh`, respectively. Tokens are stored server-side in a database and retrieved
    per user when making API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/login:
  - Pagination uses `search.startRow` (integer, defaults to 0) and `search.numberOfResults`
    (integer, defaults to 25) in the request body. Increment `startRow` by `numberOfResults`
    for subsequent requests. Set `retrieveTotal` to true to get total possible results
    in the response.
  - This API allows you to search and paginate through Login Records using offset-based
    pagination. Use the `numberOfResults` parameter to specify the number of records
    per page and `startRow` to specify the starting index for pagination; the response
    includes `total` to indicate the total number of records available.
  - Use offset-based pagination with query parameters startRow (offset, defaults to
    0) and numberOfResults (page size, defaults to 25). Increment startRow by numberOfResults
    for subsequent requests. Set retrieveTotal to true to get total possible results
    in the response.
- information_source; https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/users:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: `numberOfResults` (query parameter,
    optional, defaults to 10) controls page size, and `startRow` (query parameter,
    optional, defaults to 0) specifies the starting offset. The response includes
    `total` field indicating total matching records and `users` array containing the
    current page results; construct next request by incrementing `startRow` by `numberOfResults`
    until `startRow` >= `total`.'
  - The API uses offset-based pagination for retrieving recent logins. Request parameters
    include limit (query, optional, defaults to 10, controls maximum logins per request)
    and offset (query, optional, defaults to 0, incremented by the limit value to
    paginate through results). The response does not explicitly describe pagination
    fields, but the offset parameter is used to navigate pages by incrementing it
    by the limit value on subsequent requests.
