    ## API Key Authentication


    The Code::Stats API uses API key-based authentication. Include your API key in
    the `X-API-Key` header for all requests. The API key is a unique identifier tied
    to your user account and must be kept confidential.'
  - Code::Stats uses token-based authentication where a signed token is generated
    from the Machine control panel and must be included in all authenticated API requests
    via the HTTP header X-API-Token. The token format is a three-part string separated
    by dots (e.g., SFMyNTY.OEotWWdnPT0jI01qaz0.X0wVEZquh8Ogau1iTtBihYqqL71FD8N6p5ChQiIpaxQ)
    and authenticates both the user and their machine.
