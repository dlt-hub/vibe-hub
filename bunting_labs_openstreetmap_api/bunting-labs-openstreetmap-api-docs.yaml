notes:
- This API extracts features from the OpenStreetMap database and formats them as GeoJSON.
- All API requests require an API key that will be generated when you sign up for
  an account.
- Providing an address requires the growth plan because it consumes third-party geocoding
  resources.
- This endpoint requires the growth plan because it uses thousands of expensive geometric
  operations.
- This API serves OpenStreetMap data, which is freely available and is licensed under
  the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL).
- This API requires the growth plan because it uses thousands of expensive geometric
  operations.
- This API serves data from the US Census Bureau, which is freely available.
- This API endpoint calculates the median income inside a circle from US Census data.
- Attribution in your application is required by OpenStreetMapâ€™s ODbL license.
- This API lets users download building outlines as detected by satellite imagery
  for regions of the US, Canada, Australia, Uganda, Tanzania, and potentially more
  countries.
- Coordinates must be closed (the first must equal the last).
- Providing at least 6 decimal places is recommended.
