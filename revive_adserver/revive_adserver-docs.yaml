auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.reviveadserverrestapi.com/:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is used for all API requests. Credentials are the username
    and password of any existing Revive Adserver user. Each user can only access objects
    they have privileges for within the system. No additional configuration is required
    beyond providing valid user credentials with each request.
- information_source; https://www.reviveadserverrestapi.com/api-documentation/:
  - Authentication to the Revive Adserver REST API requires a base64 encoded user:password
    credential pair. Send this encoded value in the Authorization header using HTTP
    Basic authentication.

  - 'Basic Authentication is required. Include an Authorization header with the value
    "Basic " followed by a base64-encoded string of username and password separated
