Based on the provided documentation content and the requirements outlined, here is the YAML configuration for the `repair_shop_resources` REST API source:

client:
  base_url: "https://your-subdomain.repairshopr.com/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"  # Authentication method used

resources:
  - name: "appointment_types"
    endpoint: "/appointment_types"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response data

  - name: "appointments"
    endpoint: "/appointments"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response data

  - name: "customer_assets"
    endpoint: "/customer_assets"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      # No specific query parameters mentioned
    data_selector: "$"  # Selects the entire response data
