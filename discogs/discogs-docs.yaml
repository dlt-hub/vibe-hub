pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.discogs.com/developers:
  - Accepts pagination. The documentation references a Pagination section but does
    not specify the actual pagination parameters, fields, or mechanics within this
    excerpt. Refer to the linked Pagination documentation for details on how to paginate
    Artist Releases results.
  - Paginated resources use query parameters page (default 1) and per_page (default
    50, max 100). Responses include a Link header with rel=next, rel=prev, rel=first,
    rel=last URLs, and a pagination object containing page, pages, items, and per_page
    fields to track position and total results.
  - Pagination is supported for the Collection Items By Release endpoint using per_page
    parameter with a default value of 50 items per page. The response includes a pagination
    object containing the per_page field indicating how many items are returned per
    request.
  - Pagination parameters are accepted on this endpoint as indicated by the reference
    to the Pagination documentation. However, the specific pagination parameters,
    response fields, and navigation mechanisms are not detailed in this excerpt. To
    provide accurate pagination information, the referenced Pagination section of
    the Discogs API documentation would need to be consulted.
  - Pagination uses per_page (optional, query parameter, default appears to be set)
    and page (optional, query parameter, default appears to be 1) to control result
    sets. The response indicates pagination state through page numbering, allowing
    iteration through result pages by incrementing the page parameter.
