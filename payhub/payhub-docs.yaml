auth_info:
- information_source; http://payhub.github.io/slate/:
  - API requests require OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication. The oauth_token value
    obtained from the payHub Virtual Terminal must be passed in the Authorization
    header as a Bearer token for each API call to endpoints like https://api.payhub.com/api/v2/sale.
  - API requests require OAuth2 bearer token authentication. The oauth_token must
    be passed in the Authorization header as a bearer token, and merchant credentials
    (organization_id and terminal_id) must be included in the request body under a
    merchant object.
  - 'Based on the provided code snippet, here is the authentication information:


    OAuth2 bearer token authentication is required. The oauth_token parameter (example
    value "22fe3c69-db70-4a8c-9aed-9a33ebb1e9b4") must be obtained from the payHub
    Virtual Terminal and passed to authenticate API requests to https://api.payhub.com/api/v2/.'
  - OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens are required in the header for sales and other transactions.
    You must include an OAuth token in the request header when making API calls to
    PayHub.
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the HTTP Authorization
    header as "Bearer [your-token-here]". You will be assigned a unique Client Id
    as a third-party integrator. POST requests for Recurring Bills and Sales require
    the Merchant's Organization Id and 3rd Party Terminal Id. GET requests retrieve
    all resources for authorized Merchants and can be filtered using findByMerchantOrganizationId
    search functions. Treat tokens as sensitive credentials and never expose them
    in public code.
pagination_info:
- information_source; http://payhub.github.io/slate/:
  - By default, the list returns only the first 20 results. Pagination is controlled
    via query parameters page={pageNo} and size={size} added to the URL GET https://api.payhub.com/api/v2/verify/.
    The response structure indicates standard offset-based pagination where you increment
    pageNo to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - By default, the list returns the first 20 results. Pagination is controlled via
    query parameters page={pageNo} and size={size} added to the URL. The documentation
    does not specify response fields indicating pagination state or how to determine
    when to stop paginating.
  - The GET /api/v2/refund/ endpoint supports pagination with query parameters page={pageNo}
    and size={size}. By default, the list returns 20 results per page. Use these parameters
    to control which page and how many results per page to retrieve.
  - 'The GET endpoint for listing all recurring bills supports pagination through
    query parameters: page={pageNo} and size={size}. By default, the list returns
    the first 20 results. Use these parameters to navigate through pages and control
    the number of results per page.'
  - The getAllRecurringBillInformation method accepts optional page and size parameters
    for pagination, though the documentation does not specify their exact location
    (query/path/body), whether they are required, default values, or how the response
    indicates pagination state or navigation to subsequent pages.
