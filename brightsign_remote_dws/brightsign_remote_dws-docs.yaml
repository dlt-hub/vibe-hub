auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.brightsign.biz/developers/2025-api-usage-guide:
  - Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer [accessToken]" for all requests to select network by ID or name.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send an access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer [accessToken]". Client secrets expire every 180 days and can
    be rotated via API or UI; when rotated, a new secret is returned immediately and
    the old secret continues working temporarily before requiring the new one.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used for authentication. Obtain an access token
    from https://auth.bsn.cloud/realms/bsncloud/protocol/openid-connect/token, then
    include it in subsequent API requests using the Authorization header with Bearer
    scheme. The token response contains access_token, expires_in, and scope fields.
    All API requests require the Authorization header formatted as "Bearer [accessToken]".
- information_source; https://docs.brightsign.biz/developers/diagnostic-web-server-apis:
  - Local DWS APIs use username and password authentication, not OAuth bearer tokens.
    Credentials are sent as basic auth (HTTP Authorization header with base64-encoded
    username:password). Remote DWS APIs use bearer tokens for BSN.cloud authentication,
    sent in the Authorization header.
- information_source; https://docs.brightsign.biz/developers/main-api-version-202206:
  - BSN.cloud API uses OAuth2 protocol with customizations for person, user, and network
    entity authentication. The base URL for authentication and API requests is https://api.bsn.cloud/2022/06/REST,
    and the implementation distinguishes between person (customer), user (person instance
    in a network), and network (company) entities. Refer to the person and user entity
    documentation for specific token acquisition and credential management workflows.
