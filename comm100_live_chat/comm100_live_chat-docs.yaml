auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-reference:
  - 'Comm100 provides two authentication methods: API_key Authentication and OAuth
    Authentication. For API_key Authentication, you must use your email and API_KEY
    for each method call, sent via HTTP. The documentation references an Authentication
    page with full details on both methods and how to send credentials.'
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-introduction:
  - The Comm100 API uses an access token-based authentication system. Access tokens
    are generated through a separate API request and must be included in subsequent
    API calls. The API domain varies based on your platform (api1, api2, api3, or
    api5 corresponding to portal domains), and all requests except token generation
    must use the https://api[N].comm100.io/api/v3/ base URL with https protocol.
  - The username or API key must be provided for authentication. A 401 Unauthorized
    error is returned if the username or API key is invalid. The documentation does
    not specify the exact header names, parameter names, or how to send these credentials
    in requests.
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-authentication:
  - OAuth2 password grant flow is used for authentication. To obtain an access token,
    send a POST request to the /oauth/token endpoint with grant_type set to password,
    along with email and password parameters. The response includes an access_token
    with token_type bearer and an expires_in value in seconds. Use the access token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" when calling API endpoints.
    Tokens expire and must be refreshed by requesting a new token.

  - You need Manage Settings permission to update Auto Distribution.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-livechat-chat:
  - Pagination uses `pageIndex` (integer, optional, default 1) and `pageSize` (integer,
    optional, default 50) as query string parameters. The response structure for indicating
    total pages or a next page indicator is not described in the provided documentation.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with response fields `previousPage` and `nextPage`
    containing full URLs to navigate pages. The response also includes `totalCount`
    for the total number of results. Construct the next request by using the URL provided
    in the `nextPage` field; stop when `nextPage` is empty.
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-livechat-offline-message:
  - Pagination uses query parameter pageIndex (optional, defaults to 1) to request
    pages. Response includes total (total count), previousPage and nextPage (full
    URLs for navigation), and an array of results. Stop paginating when nextPage is
    empty.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters pageIndex (defaults
    to 1) and pageSize (defaults to 50). The response includes total count, previousPage
    and nextPage URLs for navigation, and an offlineMessages array containing the
    paginated results.
- information_source; https://developer.comm100.com/x/docs/server-api-global-setting-agent:
  - Pagination uses a URL-based approach with count, nextPage, and previousPage fields
    in the response. The nextPage field contains the full URL for the next page (including
    pageIndex parameter), and pagination ends when nextPage is empty.
