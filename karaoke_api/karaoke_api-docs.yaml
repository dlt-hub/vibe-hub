auth_info:
- information_source; https://karaoke-api-doc.stingray.com/api/v1/:
  - 'Authorization token invalid or expired is mentioned in 401 responses, and the
    Log play endpoint explicitly lists two authorization methods: X-API-KEY and Bearer.
    The X-API-KEY scheme requires sending an API key (likely via the X-API-Key header),
    and the Bearer scheme requires sending a bearer token in the Authorization header.
    Both methods are accepted for authenticating requests to the play-log endpoint.'
  - Stingray Karaoke API uses two authentication methods. First, supply an X-API-KEY
    header with your developer-provided API key. Second, call the Device login endpoint
    with X-API-KEY authorization to obtain a JWT bearer token, then use that token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://karaoke-api-doc.stingray.com/docs/introduction/getting-started:
  - 'The Karaoke API requires two authentication headers: X-API-KEY header with an
    api_key value, and Authorization header with a Bearer token (access_token). Access
    tokens are generated through a token generation process and must be included as
    Bearer credentials in requests.'
  - 'The REST Karaoke API uses two authentication mechanisms: a bearer token passed
    in the Authorization header and an API key passed in the X-API-KEY header. Replace
    {access_token} with your actual access token in the Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
    header for GET requests, and include both X-API-KEY: {api_key} and Authorization:
    Bearer {access_token} headers for POST requests.'
  - 'The Stingray Karaoke API uses Bearer Token authentication combined with an API
    key. To obtain a token, submit a POST login request with device information (device_id,
    country_code, language_code, and optionally client_ip and account_id) to the authentication
    endpoint. The API returns a Bearer token which must be included in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" for all subsequent API requests. Additionally,
    the X-API-KEY header must be set to your API key value in every request.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://karaoke-api-doc.stingray.com/docs/introduction/getting-started:
  - 'The API uses query parameters for pagination: `page` (page number, starting at
    0) and `size` (number of results per page). These are optional parameters used
    in GET requests to retrieve paginated resources like songs and artists.'
- information_source; https://karaoke-api-doc.stingray.com/api/v3/:
  - Offset-based pagination is used with limit and offset query parameters. Limit
    (max 100, default 10) specifies maximum elements returned, and offset (max 9999,
    default 0) specifies the starting index. Response includes items array, size,
    offset, and total fields to indicate pagination state.
  - Offset-limit pagination with limit parameter (integer, max 100, default 10) controlling
    maximum elements returned and offset parameter (integer, max 9999, default 0)
    specifying the starting index. Response contains items array; construct next request
    by incrementing offset by limit value until fewer than limit items are returned.
  - Pagination is controlled by limit (query parameter, max 100, default 10) and offset
    (query parameter, max 9999, default 0). Use offset to move through pages by incrementing
    it by the limit value; stop when fewer items than limit are returned.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer, default 10, max 100) and offset
    (query parameter, integer, default 0, max 9999) for requesting pages. Response
    includes items array, size, offset, and total fields to indicate pagination state
    and construct subsequent requests.
