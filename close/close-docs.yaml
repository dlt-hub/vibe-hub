notes:
- 'The response contains two fields: data containing the list of objects and has_more,
  which indicates if you reached the last page.'
- There is a maximum limit that can vary per resource. You will get a 400 response
  with an appropriate message if you exceed it.
- If you need to paginate for more than a few pages, update your query to return smaller
  batches of objects.
- If you receive a response status code of 429 (Too Many Requests), please sleep/pause
  for the number of seconds specified by the rate_reset value before making additional
  requests to that endpoint.
- API requests are limited at a per Organization level across all users' API keys.
- The per Organization limit is currently 3 times higher than individual API key rate
  limits.
- Most API responses will have the `ratelimit` header to provide rate limiting statistics
  about the limit it's closest to hitting.
- Default returns only IDs; specify _fields to get more data.
- Results can be limited using results_limit.
- Most endpoints support a `_fields` parameter that lets you specify which fields
  you require in the response. For example, if you only need `id` and `display_name`
  when listing Leads, add `?_fields=id,display_name` to the URL. This will improve
  performance of your API calls.
- In some cases, an API response can include fields that are not listed in the sample
  response for that endpoint below. Non-custom fields that are not included in the
  sample response for an endpoint should not be used in integrations, as they may
  change without warning.
- Failed deliveries are retried with a retry interval that exponentially backs off
  up to every 20 minutes.
- Event ordering is not guaranteed due to event consolidation, delivery parallelism/retries
  and other factors.
- A subscription will automatically be paused and its queue cleared when the event
  queue reaches 100,000 backlogged events.
- Warning emails will be sent to admins when there is more than 80,000 backlogged
  events.
- All event delivery fails for 3 days results in a subscription pause.
- Email notifications are sent to admins when a subscription is paused.
- Paused subscriptions must be manually re-activated via the API.
- It is recommended to process Webhook events asynchronously.
- Historical events can be accessed via the event log API for up to 30 days.
- SSL certificate validation is enabled by default but can be disabled via the verify_ssl
  field.
- To prevent problems with long URLs, parameters can also be specified in a JSON-encoded
  dictionary in the request body under the _params key.
- GET requests with a request body are against the specification, we support the x-http-method-override
  HTTP header that lets you override the request method.
- Access Token has a limited lifetime and expires in expires_in seconds from the moment
  it was issued.
- A new Refresh Token is issued when refreshing the Access Token, and the old Refresh
  Token must be discarded.
