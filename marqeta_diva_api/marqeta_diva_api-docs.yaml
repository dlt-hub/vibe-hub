auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/authentication:
  - Application tokens and user access tokens are used for authentication via HTTP
    Basic Auth. Include the application token as the username and the user access
    token as the password in the --user parameter (formatted as `application_token:user_access_token`).
    User access tokens expire after two hours, user single-access tokens expire after
    two hours, client access tokens expire after 5 minutes, and application tokens
    never expire. Token requests are throttled to three per 60 consecutive seconds;
    throttled requests return HTTP 401.

  - Once you have your DiVA API tokens, you can use them to authenticate requests
    to the DiVA API. Set up authentication by selecting an authorization type in the
    Authorization area and entering your tokens in tools like Postman. For more details
    on the specific authentication mechanism and how to obtain tokens, refer to the
    Authentication documentation at https://www.marqeta.com/docs/diva-api/authentication/.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/authorization-controls:
  - The `count` query parameter specifies the number of resources to return per request
    (optional, integer), and the `start_index` query parameter specifies the sort
    order index for pagination (optional, integer). The response includes a `count`
    field indicating the number of resources returned and a `data` array containing
    the paginated results.
  - The endpoint supports offset-based pagination using count (number of resources
    per page, optional integer) and start_index (sort order index to start from, optional
    integer) query parameters. The response includes a count field indicating the
    number of resources returned.
- information_source; https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/sorting-and-pagination:
  - Paginated responses include count (number of resources), start_index and end_index
    (sort order indices), is_more (boolean indicating if more results exist), and
    data (array of returned objects). The is_more field indicates whether to continue
    paginating for additional results.
- information_source; https://www.marqeta.com/docs/diva-api/exploring-the-diva-api:
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters: request parameter `start` (optional,
    defaults to 0) and response fields `total` (total record count), `count` (records
    returned), and `is_more` (boolean indicating more records exist). Continue paginating
    by incrementing `start` until `is_more` is false.'
  - 'The `/chargebacks/detail` endpoint returns paginated data with response fields:
    `total` (total record count), `is_more` (boolean indicating more records exist),
    and `count` (records in current response). Use `is_more` to determine if additional
    requests are needed, though the exact request parameter for pagination is not
    specified in this documentation excerpt.'
