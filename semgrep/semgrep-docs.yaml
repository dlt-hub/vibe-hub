pagination_info:
- information_source; https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/:
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach. The request body accepts an optional
    cursor parameter to paginate through scans. The response includes a cursor field
    that should be used in the next request to retrieve the following page of results.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with a cursor parameter (string, uint64
    type) in the request body. The response includes a previous field (string) for
    navigating backwards, and likely a next cursor field for forward navigation, though
    the full response structure is not completely shown in the provided text.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation with pageSize parameter. Request includes
    pageSize (default 100) as query parameter. Response returns cursor string for
    next page and hasMore boolean to indicate if more results exist; use the returned
    cursor value in the next request to continue paginating.
  - pageSize is an optional query/body parameter (default/max 1000) controlling results
    per page. Responses include cursor (string for next page) and hasMore (boolean
    indicating if more results exist). Use the returned cursor value in the next request
    to fetch subsequent pages; stop when hasMore is false.
  - pageSize is an optional request parameter (default 100) that controls the number
    of results per page. The response includes cursor (for the next page) and hasMore
    (boolean indicating if more results exist). To paginate, use the cursor value
    from the response in the next request's cursor parameter.
