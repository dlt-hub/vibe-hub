- API documentation is essential for understanding and using APIs effectively.
- Modern documentation includes interactive features like 'Try It' functionality.
- DreamFactory is a REST API management platform.
- Automatically creates Swagger documentation for every API it generates.

- Features include a clear menu on the left side of the screen listing topics and
  subtopics, making navigation straightforward.
- Getting Started guides are crucial for new users.
- DreamFactory auto-generates REST APIs from SQL Server and instantly publishes OpenAPI-based
  docs, reducing drift between implementation and documentation while preserving role-based
  access and governance controls across environments.
- Documentation updates when your data model or access rules change
- Interactive docs respect roles, rate limits, and object-level permissions
- DreamFactory simplifies API authentication challenges.
- DreamFactory includes built-in connectors to simplify OAuth 2.0 setup.
- Rapid API enablement over existing data sources; integrated security and docs; excellent
  for internal data access layers and app backends.
- Not a dedicated no-code ETL platform; advanced connectors/features may vary by edition;
  self-hosting requires standard ops unless using a managed option.
- Rapid API generation and management over existing data sources
- Instant API scaffolding, built-in auth/RBAC, and live docs
- DreamFactory automates version management, reducing manual effort and ensuring seamless
  updates.
