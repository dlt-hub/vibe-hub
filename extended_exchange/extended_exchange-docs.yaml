pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.docs.extended.exchange/:
  - Cursor-based pagination is used across Extended API endpoints. Paginated responses
    include a pagination object with cursor (current cursor value) and count (items
    in response). Use the cursor value from the response as the request parameter
    for the next page; continue paginating until the desired data is retrieved.
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with optional query parameters cursor (offset
    determined by item ID from previous response) and limit (maximum items returned).
    The response includes a pagination object with cursor and count fields; use the
    cursor value from the previous response in the next request's cursor parameter
    to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. The response includes a pagination object
    with cursor (a number representing the next page position) and count (number of
    items returned). To fetch the next page, pass the cursor value as a query parameter
    in the subsequent request; continue until no cursor is returned or count is zero.
  - The Extended API uses cursor-based pagination across all endpoints. Pagination
    parameters passed via query string include cursor (optional, number) representing
    the item ID after which to retrieve the next result, and limit (optional, number)
    for maximum items returned. Use the cursor value from the previous response's
    pagination section to fetch the next page.
  - Use cursor-based pagination with optional limit parameter. The cursor query parameter
    specifies the ID after which to retrieve results; use the cursor value from the
    pagination section of the previous response to get the next page. The endpoint
    returns a maximum of 10,000 records per request.
