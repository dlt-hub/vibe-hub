    (query, optional, integer between 1 and 10000) and page_token (query, optional,
    string for navigation). Response includes page_token for retrieving subsequent
    pages.'

    a next_page_token field; use this token value as the offset parameter in the next
    request to retrieve subsequent pages. Stop paginating when next_page_token is
    not returned.
  - Pagination uses a next_page_token field in the response. Include next_page_token
    as a query parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of linked
    contacts. Stop paginating when next_page_token is not returned or is null.
  - Pagination uses a next_page_token field returned in the response. To retrieve
    the next page, use the next_page_token value as a query parameter in the subsequent
    request. Continue paginating until next_page_token is absent or null.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page_size (integer, 1-based) and page_token
    (string) for requests. The response includes a next_page_token field; use its
    value as the page_token parameter in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages.
