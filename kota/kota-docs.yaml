- Adjustments for corrections must include original contribution reference.
- Pro-rated contributions for new employees should maintain clear records of join
  dates.

  report, even if they share the same employer'
- 'Customer-specific filtering: You can filter reports by external_customer_id when
  retrieving contribution reports'
- 'Consistent identification: The same external_customer_id appears in both the contribution
  report and all associated employee breakdowns'
