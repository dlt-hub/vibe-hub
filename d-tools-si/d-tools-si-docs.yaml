notes:
- The D-Tools SI API is Cloud-based and has been created to bridge the data from the
  on-premises (or hosted) D-Tools instance to a cloud API Server.
- When you POST data to the API, that data is stored on the API until it is applied
  to D-Tools SI.
- No enforced polling intervals required by the API.
- Large datasets may take longer to process.
- Webhooks provide an efficient alternative to polling.
- Each location requires additional SI Server and Client licenses. Contact your SI
  Account Manager to purchase.
- You must be part of the Administrator group in SI to be able to view your SI Product
  Key.
- The SI Server must be installed on Windows; there is no Mac version of SI.
- The SI Server will not install on a Mac with an M1, M2, or M3 processor.
- Passwords must be 12 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter,
  one lowercase letter, a number, and a funky symbol.
- Backup and Restore operations are performed in the SI Server Manager. So, you must
  have proper permissions to access the SI Server Manager.
- Default maximum of seven backups are retained in the backup folder.
- Backup files are named SIServerBackup_[Date].zip.
- Administrator user group has access to all SI features.
- Standard User user group has access only to the Time Sheets functionality.
- Concurrent logins are determined by the number of SI licenses.
- 'You can create three types of users in SI: User, Resource, Mobile Installer.'
- A Mobile Install license is required for each Mobile Install user.
- SI integration with AAD allows you to log into SI using the same credentials as
  AAD, providing a Single Sign-On option.
- Once a user has been imported from AAD or linked to an AAD user, no passwords are
  stored in SI.
- Labor items are items in your SI catalog that are set to type 'Labor.'
- You can use a combination of Fixed and Variable for your labor items by checking
  both boxes.
- PDF files are not ideal because they are not vector files.
- The image quality can also degrade once inserted into Visio.
- 'Predecessors can be of different types: Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS),
  Finish-to-Finish (FF), Start-to-Finish (SF).'
- You must have a minimum of 2 planning tasks to add a predecessor.
- Default reports export nicely only in PDF format.
- Settings in Save To and File Name Format sections will be stored for future exports.
- The file size limit is 10 MB per file.
- Overall MI account has no size limit.
- File size limit is 10 MB per file, but the overall Mobile Install account has no
  size limit.
- You must have appropriate user permissions to manage service plans.
- Some fields will be pre-mapped if they are an exact match or if they are a close
  match.
- Mobile Install (MI) licenses are different than SI licenses.
- You automatically have an MI license for every SI license that you have.
- Service orders are categorized as Not Started, In Progress, Completed, and Overdue.
- QuickBooks Desktop must be installed on the machine where the SI client is installed.
- You must be logged into QuickBooks as the Admin, and you must be in 'Single User
  Mode.'
- The required accounts will vary depending on your Item Type setting.
- If any items in the estimate are not assigned to QuickBooks items, you must do this
  before transferring the estimate to QuickBooks.
- You must create or map all items before pushing the estimate to QuickBooks.
- Some fields in SI can be mapped to any of the five available Custom fields in QuickBooks.
- You should do this if you wish to modify the project and then push over a new estimate
  to QuickBooks.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in QuickBooks
- This article explains how to register the Mobile Quote app with SI
- Email body will be constructed using the email template.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- ProPay is for US clients only.
- Standard limit for ProPay transactions is $5,000; additional correspondence and
  approval from ProPay are not required.
- Changing settings on a default BA will not save them for future use.
- Project Item BA is not available for display on the home page due to load time.
- To use time sheets, you must enter a Burdened Labor Cost for your resources. Otherwise,
  the time sheets cannot be approved.
- A time entry will be considered inadequate if it has not been mapped to a project,
  task, or service order.
- The resource name in the CSV doesn't match a resource in SI.
- Time sheets flagged as 'Inadequate' must be updated before importing into SI.
- Resources will automatically be assigned if QuickBooks Time user's name matches
  the resource name in SI.
- If an API Key is not passed in the header or if the API is invalid the service will
  return an error.
- You must be an SI administrator to configure and manage the integrations.
