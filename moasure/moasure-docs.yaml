notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Moasure works by connecting to the Moasure companion app, and using Bluetooth to
  transmit measurement data.
- Moasure 2 and Moasure 2 Pro use USB Type-C cable
- Moasure ONE uses a Micro USB cable
- By default, Moasure automatically switches itself off after 30 seconds of inactivity.
- This setting is only available with a Moasure 2 PRO.
- 'To achieve maximum accuracy in motion-based measurements, follow these three key
  techniques: Pace, Placement, Rotation.'
- To maximise measurement accuracy, pause every 6 to 8 seconds during a measurement.
- New measurements or any edits made to existing ones are not saved automatically.
- Configuration options are available in app version 1.8 and upwards.
- Scale is not supported for 3D exports.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Moasure
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some measurements may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses Straight Line for capturing lengths and shapes
- Ignored paths cannot be labelled
- Coordinates of points measured using Points Path or Ignore Path that are not labeled,
  will not show on the PDF Export.
- Step-by-step tutorial for accurately measuring a residential house and backyard
  using Moasure.
- Uses Optimise Route feature to arrange coordinates in logical order.
- Layout is only available with Moasure 2 PRO devices.
- CAD Import is available from Moasure app version 3.2 and above.
- Optional ‘Optimise Route’ feature arranges x, y coordinates in the most logical
  order and shortest distance.
- Simplify Driveway Measurements
- This guide will walk you through the steps to accurately measure and calculate the
  square footage of a driveway.
- To access the API, please contact support@moasure.com.
- Export measurement diagrams straight from the Moasure app into SketchUp design software.
