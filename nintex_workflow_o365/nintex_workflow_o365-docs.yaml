  - The Nintex Office 365 API requires an API Key and an authentication token. You
    must obtain your API Key and API Base URL, then create an authentication token
    before making REST API calls. The documentation references steps for token creation
    but does not provide explicit details about header names, parameter names, or
    the token format in this excerpt.

  : - Azure Active Directory OAuth2 password grant flow. Send POST request to Azure
      AD token endpoint with grant_type "password", client_id, client_secret, username,
      password, scope "openid", and resource "https://api.k2.com/". Include tenantId
      in the token endpoint URL. The response returns an access token for authenticating
      subsequent API requests to the K2 environment.
    - 'The Workflow REST API supports two authentication methods: Windows Integrated
      Authentication and OAuth. For Windows Integrated Authentication, set the UseDefaultCredentials
      property to true in your HttpWebRequest to use the currently logged-on user''s
      credentials. For OAuth, obtain a token using ClientID and Client Secret credentials
      (avoid hard-coding these; use a secure store instead), then include the token
      in subsequent API requests.'
    - 'This API supports two authentication methods: Basic Authentication and Windows
      Integrated Authentication. For Basic Authentication, pass username and password
      credentials via an HttpClientHandler with the Credentials property set to a
      NetworkCredential object containing the username and password. For Windows Integrated
      Authentication, enable Windows Authentication in IIS for the Workflow API. OAuth
      authentication is also mentioned as an option requiring Azure Active Directory
      configuration per KB002784.'
