auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/apacta.com/0.0.42/openapi.json:
  - 'API requests require authentication via the x-auth-token header. Include your
    token in the x-auth-token request header when making API calls, for example x-auth-token:
    {INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN}.'
  - Authentication uses a custom header-based token scheme. Include the x-auth-token
    header with your token value in all API requests. The token should be passed as
    a request header with the key x-auth-token and the value set to your authentication
    token.
  - Authentication uses a custom token passed in the x-auth-token header. Replace
    {INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN} with your actual token value and include it in all API requests
    as the x-auth-token header.
  - Authentication uses a custom token-based scheme. Include your token in the x-auth-token
    request header with the value {INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN}.
  - 'Requests to this endpoint require one of two authentication methods: an X-Auth-Token
    header or an api_key header. Either credential type is acceptable for authorization.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/apacta.com/0.0.42/openapi.json:
  - If the endpoint returns a pagination object, pagination is supported using the
    query parameter page with a page number value (e.g., ?page={page_number}). Custom
    page sizes are not currently implemented.
  - The API uses a limit query parameter to control pagination. The example shows
    limit=5 in the request URL, indicating that the limit parameter controls how many
    results are returned per page. However, the documentation chunk does not describe
    response fields for navigation (such as next, has_more, or cursor), stopping conditions,
    or how to construct subsequent requests.
