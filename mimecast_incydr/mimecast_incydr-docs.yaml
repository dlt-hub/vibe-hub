  - API clients authenticate using a client ID and secret pair submitted to the Auth
    API to obtain an authentication token, which is then used in subsequent requests.
    The client ID, secret, and base URL are required to authenticate and retrieve
    the token for API access.
  - 'Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with an API client ID and secret to obtain
    a bearer token, then includes that token in the Authorization header for subsequent
    API requests. POST to <request_url>/v1/oauth with Basic Auth credentials (ClientID:Secret)
    to receive an access_token valid for 900 seconds, then use "Authorization: Bearer
    <access_token>" header in all API requests.'
