- API keys and hostnames are different in each environment. Use sandbox keys and URL
  in the sandbox environment and production keys in production.
- You can provide the optional account field to specify which account the paid invoice
  will credit.
- Widgets are designed to be used with the Checkbook Marketplace and will not work
  with non-marketplace users and payments.
