auth_info:

  - To generate a user authorization token, you must first create a user (either as
    a superuser via the command line or as a normal user via the web interface at
    /admin/). The REST API uses django-rest-framework and requires user authorization
    tokens for authenticated requests; tokens are generated for users and should be
    sent in API requests to authenticate. Exact header names and token format details
    are available in the hosted REST API documentation at /apiv2/.
- information_source; https://capev2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dist.html:
  - Register a new CAPE node using POST /node with optional apikey parameter for authentication.
    The apikey is passed as a form field and is required if auth is enabled on the
    Node API.
  - apikey parameter is required for authorization on the PUT /node/<name> endpoint.
    Pass it as a form field or query parameter named apikey when updating node information.

  - 'Cloudflare API uses two required headers for authentication: X-Auth-Email containing
    the Cloudflare user email and X-Auth-Key containing the Cloudflare API token.
    These headers must be included in all requests to the firewall access rules endpoint.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://capev2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/api.html:
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: limit (maximum number of returned
    tasks) and offset (data offset). Both are integers and optional, with no specified
    defaults or maximum values mentioned.'
  - The GET /tasks/list/ endpoint uses path parameters limit and offset for pagination.
    The response returns a tasks array; construct subsequent requests by incrementing
    the offset parameter by the limit value until the tasks array is empty or contains
    fewer results than the limit.
- information_source; https://capev2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/web.html:
  - The API supports pagination via query parameters page and per_page. The page parameter
    specifies the page number (starting at 1), and per_page specifies results per
    page. The response includes pagination metadata to determine available pages.
