auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.flyreel.co/:
  - 'API requests require two custom headers for authentication: access-key header
    containing your access key and secret-key header containing your secret key. Both
    headers must be included in every request.'
  - 'All API endpoints require authentication using two custom headers: access-key
    and secret-key. API keys are generated through the Flyreel dashboard or by contacting
    your Account Manager. Include both headers in every API request with your respective
    access key and secret key values.'
  - All webhook requests are signed with a private key, and the hash is included in
    the header under x-flyreel-signature to ensure security. Verify the signature
    by comparing the x-flyreel-signature header value against your locally computed
    HMAC hash of the request body using your private key.
  - Flyreel API uses API keys for authentication. Customers are responsible for securely
    storing API keys and their associated secret keys, and for invalidating any compromised
    keys. Flyreel provides the means to generate API keys that grant access to the
    API, but does not manage customer-side API key storage or integration setup.
  - Flyreel signs all webhook requests with a private key and attaches the base64-encoded
    hash in the `x-flyreel-signature` header. To verify authenticity, obtain Flyreel's
    public key and use it with a signature validation library to validate the `x-flyreel-signature`
    header value against the request body.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.flyreel.co/:
  - Pagination uses limit (integer 1-200, default unspecified) and offset (integer
    >=0, default 0) query parameters. Response includes total, limit, offset fields
    and a conversations array; construct next request by incrementing offset by limit
    until offset >= total.
