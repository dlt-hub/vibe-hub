  - OAuth authentication is supported by obtaining a bearer token from an authentication
    URL, then including it as a Bearer Token in the Authorization header of subsequent
    API calls. The workflow involves sending an initial request to retrieve the token,
    parsing the JSON response to extract it, and using that token in the header for
    all following API requests.
