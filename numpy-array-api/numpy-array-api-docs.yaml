notes:
- This is documentation for an unstable development version.
- __array_struct__ is considered legacy and should not be used for new code. Use the
  buffer protocol or the DLPack protocol instead.
- Uses array creation functions to manage memory.
- Prior to NumPy 2.0 the ABI was different but unnecessary large for user DTypes.
- As of NumPy 2.0 this API is considered legacy, the new DType API is more powerful
  and provides additional flexibility.
- The API may eventually be deprecated but support is continued for the time being.
- These functions allow defining custom flexible data types outside of NumPy.
- See NEP 42 for more details about the rationale and design of the new DType system.
- If you are experiencing access violations make sure that the NumPy API was properly
  imported and the symbol PyArray_API is not NULL.
- Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.
- Values are rounded towards -inf instead of 0 when an integer dtype is specified.
- NumPy is the fundamental library for array containers in the Python Scientific Computing
  stack.
- Some of the descriptor attributes may not always be defined and should or cannot
  not be accessed directly.
- 'Changed in version 2.0: Prior to NumPy 2.0 the ABI was different but unnecessary
  large for user DTypes.'
- This API is mainly for backwards compatibility to the Numeric C-API
- In the unlikely case that you are heap allocating the dtype struct you should free
  it again on NumPy 2, since a copy is made.
- Data-type objects must be reference counted so be aware of the action on the data-type
  reference of different C-API calls.
- The standard rule is that when a data-type object is returned it is a new reference.
- Type is preserved for boolean arrays, so the result will contain False when consecutive
  elements are the same and True when they differ.
- For unsigned integer arrays, the results will also be unsigned.
- NumPy uses C-order indexing.
- Basic slicing creates a view instead of a copy.
- The native NumPy indexing type is intp and may differ from the default integer array
  type.
- For advanced assignments, there is in general no guarantee for the iteration order.
- An empty (tuple) index is a full scalar index into a zero-dimensional array.
- If a zero-dimensional array is present in the index and it is a full integer index
  the result will be a scalar.
- When an ellipsis (...) is present but has no size the result will still always be
  an array.
- The nonzero equivalence for Boolean arrays does not hold for zero dimensional boolean
  arrays.
- When the result of an advanced indexing operation has no elements but an individual
  index is out of bounds, whether or not an IndexError is raised is undefined.
- When a casting error occurs during assignment, the array being assigned to may end
  up in an unpredictable partially updated state.
- The memory layout of an advanced indexing result is optimized for each indexing
  operation and no particular memory order can be assumed.
- When using a subclass, the default ndarray.__setitem__ behaviour will call __getitem__
  for basic indexing but not for advanced indexing.
