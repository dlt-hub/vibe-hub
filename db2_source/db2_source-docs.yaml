Based on the provided documentation content regarding the `db2_source` API, here is a complete YAML configuration for the REST API source:

client:
  base_url: "jdbc:db2://{host}:{port}/{database}/"
  auth:
    type: "basic"
    username: "access_username"
    password: "access_password"

resources:
  - name: "tables"
    endpoint: "/tables"
    method: "GET"
    params:
      - name: "schema"  # Optional: specify schema to filter tables
        type: "string"
        description: "Schema name to filter the tables"
    data_selector: "$.tables"  # Adjusted to reflect the expected data structure for tables

  - name: "schemas"
    endpoint: "/schemas"
    method: "GET"
    params: []
    data_selector: "$.schemas"  # Adjusted to reflect the expected data structure for schemas
