auth_info:
- information_source; https://build.avax.network/llms-full.txt:
  - API key authentication is required for all requests. Pass your API key in the
    `x-glacier-api-key` header of each HTTP request. API keys are generated from the
    AvaCloud portal and are used to track rate limits associated with your account
    plan.
  - API key authentication. The apiKey parameter is passed directly to the Avalanche
    SDK constructor during initialization and is used to authenticate requests to
    the API.
  - 'Authorization header using Bearer token. The API key is provided via the ONESIGNAL_API_KEY
    environment variable and sent as Authorization: Bearer {ONESIGNAL_API_KEY}. Additionally,
    app_id must be included in the request body and is provided via the APP_ID environment
    variable.'
  - The API accepts an optional apikey parameter in the request body, but it is not
    required for contract verification on Snowtrace. If provided, use any placeholder
    value. For Hardhat verification, store your wallet seed phrase in a .env.json
    file under the MNEMONIC key, though this is used for deployment rather than API
    authentication itself.
  - The Avalanche SDK requires an API key passed as the apiKey parameter when instantiating
    the Avalanche client object. This API key is used to authenticate requests to
    the Avalanche data API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://build.avax.network/llms-full.txt:
  - Pagination uses a nextPageToken field in responses. Include the nextPageToken
    value as the pageToken query parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve the
    next page of results. When nextPageToken is absent from the response, there are
    no more pages to retrieve.
  - Pagination uses pageSize (optional, controls results per page) as a request parameter
    and nextPageToken in the response to navigate to subsequent pages. Use the returned
    nextPageToken value in the next request to fetch the following page, continuing
    until no nextPageToken is returned.
  - The `avax.getUTXOs` method supports cursor-based pagination using `startIndex`
    (containing address and utxo fields) as the pagination cursor and `limit` (number,
    default appears to be 100 or similar) to control page size. The response returns
    `endIndex` with the same structure to use as the next `startIndex`, and `numFetched`
    to indicate results returned; continue paginating by using the previous response's
    `endIndex` as the next request's `startIndex` until `numFetched` is less than
    the requested `limit`.
