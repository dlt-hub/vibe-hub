notes:
- Device activation relies on a valid TLS certification managed by Afterpay Touch
  (APT) host.
- The device will need to periodically renew the access token, indicated by expiresInSecs,
  required by all API endpoints.
- Requires a valid TOKEN and the PINpad must be registered successfully to the practice.
- Afterpay Touch Health uses access tokens for API access.
- Requires a valid TOKEN and registered PINpad to function.
- Valid token is required for all requests.
- PINpad must be registered successfully to the practice.
- Access tokens are created using the Create Token endpoint.
- Valid TOKEN is required.
- Requires TLS 1.2 or greater for secure communications.
- Secret key provided is one time use only.
- In the integration environment the same secret key can be allowed for re-use.
- OK and CANCEL key should not be displayed together
- Secret key provided is one time use only. Once the device is activated the same
  secret key cannot be used again to call this resource again.
- Requires correct Authorization Bearer token in header
- Uses TLS 1.2 or greater for secure communication
