auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.jazzhr.com/s/article/API-Overview:
  - API access is secured using an API Key, a complex alphanumeric string that must
    be provided to authenticate requests. The API Key can be found in the Integration
    tab under Settings and is only visible to Super Administrators, Recruiting Administrators,
    or Developers. The documentation at resumatorapi.com/v1 contains specific details
    on how to include this key in API requests.
  - API authentication uses a query parameter named apikey containing a 32-digit alphanumeric
    secret key obtained from the JazzHR account. The apikey parameter must be included
    in all API requests as a query string parameter (e.g., ?apikey=your_secret_key).
    All API calls must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher; HTTP and lower TLS versions
    are no longer supported as of January 24, 2024.
  - The API uses an API key for authentication, passed as a query parameter named
    apikey in the request URL (e.g., ?apikey=your_secret_key).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://help.jazzhr.com/s/article/API-Overview:
  - 'Each API call returns a maximum of 100 results per page. To retrieve additional
    pages, append "/page/#" to the request URI where # is the page number starting
    from 1 and incrementing until no additional results are returned.'
  - Pagination uses path-based page numbers. Request /applicants/page/1, /applicants/page/2,
    /applicants/page/3, etc., where each page returns 100 applicants. The documentation
    does not specify a stopping condition or total count field.
