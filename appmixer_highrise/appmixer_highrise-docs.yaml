  - 'Appmixer supports four authentication mechanisms: API Key, Password, OAuth 1,
    and OAuth 2. When the definition property is specified as a function, it receives
    a context object containing credentials specific to the auth mechanism. For OAuth
    1, context includes consumerKey, username, password, and consumerSecret; for OAuth
    2, it includes clientId and clientSecret. All mechanisms include callbackUrl in
    the context. The requestProfileInfo property can be defined as a function, object,
    or URL string to retrieve user profile information using the provided credentials.'
  - 'Asana uses OAuth 2.0 with refresh token flow. Access tokens are obtained via
    POST to https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_token with grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token,
    redirect_uri, client_id, and client_secret passed as query parameters. The access
    token is then sent as a bearer token in the Authorization header (format: bearer
    {{accessToken}}) for API requests. Token expiration is provided in the expires_in
    field of the response.'
  - Freshdesk API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The API key (obtained from Profile
    settings) is sent as the username with password 'X' in either the Authorization
    header as 'Basic base64(apiKey:X)' or via the auth parameter with user set to
    the API key and password set to 'X'. The domain name is also required and used
    to construct the API endpoint URL as https://{domain}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/agents/me
    for validation.
  - OAuth 1.0a authentication is used. The flow requires an accessToken and accessTokenSecret,
    which are passed to the getProtectedResourceAsync method for API requests. Token
    validation is performed by making a GET request to the Trello API endpoint https://api.trello.com/1/tokens/
    with the accessToken parameter, and returns a 401 status code if the token is
    invalid or expired. The accessToken and accessTokenSecret must be stored in the
    context object for use in subsequent API calls.
  - 'OAuth2 authentication is used. For Dropbox: authorization URL is https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize,
    token endpoint is https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token, and the access token is
    sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header (format: "Bearer {{accessToken}}").
    For Microsoft: scopes are [''offline_access'', ''user.read''] with space delimiter,
    authorization URL is https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize,
    token endpoint is https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token,
    refresh token endpoint is https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token,
    and Bearer token validation uses GET request to https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me
    with bearer auth.'
