  - Bearer token authentication is required. The Authorization header must be set
    to "Bearer {{token}}" where {{token}} is replaced with a valid authentication
    token. The Content-Type header should be set to "application/json".
  - Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. To refresh
    an access token, POST to {{url}}/ECM/oauth/access_token with urlencoded body parameters
    grant_type set to "refresh_token" and refresh_token set to your refresh token
    value. The response includes a new access_token with token_type "Bearer" that
    should be used in subsequent requests. Refresh tokens are long-lived but can be
    invalidated at any time, requiring your application to handle invalidation gracefully
    by obtaining new credentials.
