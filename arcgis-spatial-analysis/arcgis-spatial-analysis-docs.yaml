- Uses OAuth2 — requires setup of connected app in ArcGIS
- You can also use OAuth 2.0 with app authentication to access resources without requiring
  users to sign in.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Spatial analysis is the process of using analytical techniques to find relationships,
  discover patterns, and solve problems with geographic data.
- As a developer, you need to implement authentication in your applications to access
  the spatial analysis services.
- Uses client-side API to perform geometry operations.
- Most APIs use the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) to evaluate
  if two geometries have a specific type of relationship.
- The server can return geometry in different spatial references.
- To access the spatial analysis service, you need to make a /self request to your
  portal.
- All feature analysis requests to the spatial analysis service are job requests.
- Security and authentication are required to access the spatial analysis service.
- The analysis service requires input data in the form of feature data.
- Requires Spatial Analysis > Feature analysis privilege.
- To get an access token for this operation, go to the Get started section.
- Requires setup of access token with Spatial Analysis > Feature analysis privilege.
- You need to ensure that the hosted feature layer from which you want to extract
  features has the Allow others to export to different formats box checked in the
  Settings tab in the layer's item page.
- The input feature data for merge must contain the same type of geometry (point,
  polyline, or polygon).
- Outputs results as a hosted feature layer.
- To get an access token for this operation, go to Security and authentication guide.

  between points, as well as the area and perimeter of polygons.
- To access both types of endpoints you need an ArcGIS Location Platform account or
  ArcGIS Online account.
- An ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account is required to use the service.
- A viewshed represents the locations visible from one or more specified points or
  lines.
- ArcGIS Pro is a desktop GIS application with tools to create, manage, and analyze
  2D and 3D maps and geospatial data.
- Line of sight analysis requires that you specify observer and target locations,
  which can be either a point location or a geoelement.
- Authentication is not required for performing geometry and 3D visual analysis with
  client-side APIs.
- You can use ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Hub, and ArcGIS Online to search
  for data without logging in, but to develop applications with the spatial analysis
  service, you need an ArcGIS account.

  compared to using ArcGIS CDN-hosted assets.
- Since version 4.33 of the JavaScript Maps SDK, assets switched from /dist/arcgis-<package-name>/assets/
  to /dist/cdn/assets/ as part of the new CDN endpoint for components.
- The local asset paths may be different between your local development environment
  and the production environment.
- 'Some components load font files (.woff2). To ensure these assets are supported
  in Angular, add a loader configuration in your angular.json: ''loader'': { ''.woff2'':
  ''file'' }'
- Cancellation is particularly valuable in high-frequency or interruptible workflows,
  such as querying features as the mouse moves over a map.
- Aborting does not instantly stop operations

  FeatureLayer.
- This update enhances formatting options to align with internationalization standards.
- Due to ArcGIS CDN endpoint changes for components, component package assets have
  moved from /dist/arcgis-<package-name>/assets/ to /dist/cdn/assets/. Ensure that
  assets are being pulled from the correct path when working with assets in disconnected
  environments.

- Support is limited to 1:1 and 1:M cardinality.
- Support is limited to feature-to-table relationships, where the table is accessed
  through a feature.
- For local builds using TypeScript, we are in the process of making the SDK's TypeScript
  definitions strict null compatible.
- Earlier versions of the API will not honor the timeExtent of Bookmarks authored
  at version 4.30 or later due to a WebMap serialization error.
- FeatureEffect.toJSON() now returns the includedEffect and excludedEffect as an array
  of objects with type and amount properties.
- For local builds, compatibility with Webpack versions prior to 5.84.0 has been removed
  since 4.29.
- There is no support for printing with any Printing Service published with ArcMap.
  Instead, publish new Print Services with ArcGIS Pro.
- Compatibility with implementations that don't support async/await within AMD modules
  has been removed at 4.27.

- You need an access token with the correct privileges to access the location services
  used in this tutorial.
- 'Create an API key with the privilege: Location services > Basemaps.'
- To access the location services, an access token with the correct privileges is
  required.
- The vector tile layer provides the base colors and the image tile layer provides
  the hillshade or topographic effect.
- Create an API key with the privilege of Location services > Basemaps.
- Graphics layers are displayed on top of all other layers.
- Polygon graphics support a number of Symbol types, such as SimpleFillSymbol.

- To get an access token with the correct privileges to access the location services
  used in this tutorial.
- Default popup behavior can be disabled with mapElement.popupEnabled = false.
- Create an API key with Location services > Basemaps privileges.
- Requires an ArcGIS Online account for access
- Layers that allow you to query and filter subsets of their features can be grouped
  into server-side layers and client-side layers.
- The maximum number of features returned by a query for hosted feature layers is
  2000.
- Features are added to the map as polygon graphics based on SQL query results.
- To access the location services, create an API key with Location services > Basemaps
  privilege.
- To return more, detect if the request exceeded the maximum feature amount with exceededTransferLimit.
- Some fields in the popup template may not always be present.
- Graphics are visual elements used to display points, lines, polygons, and text in
  a map or scene.
- Create an API key with the privilege Location services > Basemaps.
- No features are displayed when the layer is loaded due to definitionExpression being
  set to '1=0'.
- Polygon graphics support a number of Symbol types.
- User can edit multiple layers of a Feature Service with one REST call.
- Editing multiple layers at once is possible.
- Recommended to create and load web scenes by their item ID.
- Ensure that the Enable Editing property is set to true in the feature layer's item
  page.
- The scene view should display the topographic basemap layer and elevation layer
  for an area of the Santa Monica Mountains in California.
- This style is configured with a Unique Value Renderer.
- You can also use a class breaks renderer to accomplish the same visualization using
  numeric data.
- Class breaks are a good choice to use with percents, rates, ratios and other normalized
  data.
- Classified visualizations are ideal for maps where predefined breaks hold meaning
  to the end user.
- Visualizes ranges of values normalized by the area of each polygon.
- Explores earthquakes based on their magnitude.
- An access token is required for secure ArcGIS content.
- An access token with specific privileges is required to access location services.
- Uses FeatureLayer to display hiker symbols with trailhead names
- Age visualizations may be applied in various scenarios.
- Age is defined using the DateDiff function in an Arcade expression.
- The feature layer will autocast the renderer to create class instances of the object.
- In a predominance visualization, the color representing the predominant value will
  shade the whole polygon with the same opacity and saturation as any neighboring
  polygon.
- Adding an opacity variable helps emphasize strong predominant values.
- A dot density renderer requires a list of attributes matching a data value returned
  from a field or Arcade expression with a color.
- A dotValue is required to indicate the value each dot represents.
- Server-side layers fetch only required features when they load.
- Client-side layers fetch all of their features at once and store them on the client-side
  when they load.
- Always set a referenceScale to make the visualization work across many scale levels.
- Set a minScale on the layer.
- Setting a maxScale on the layer is important to maintain readability.
- To access a subset of features, you can execute either a SQL or spatial query, or
  both at the same time.
- Pie chart renderer requires a minimum of two attributes.
- The relationship style is generated using a Smart Mapping renderer creator method.
- The SQL query is applied to the visible extent of the map.
- Requires an API key with Location services > Basemaps privilege.
- Smart Mapping APIs provide good starting points for styling layers, but you shouldn't
  assume the renderer generated by a Smart Mapping function is the most appropriate
  way to represent the data.
- Clustering should only be used as a visualization technique to reduce visual clutter
  because of many overlapping features or to provide a quick preview of feature density.
- Create a displayResults function to define a symbol and a popupTemplate for polygon
  graphics.
- Assign the symbol and popupTemplate elements to each feature returned from the query.
- Clear the existing graphics and pop-up, and then add the new features to the map
  as graphics.
- Update the queryFeaturelayer function to call the displayResults function.
- Clusters recalculate at each zoom level.
- Clustering summarizes the layer renderer.
- Definition expressions are different than feature layer queries and only support
  a SQL where clause without a geometry.
- The feature layer does not need to be added to the map to perform server-side queries.
- Binning can only be configured in a MapView.
- Binning should only be used as a visualization technique to reduce visual clutter.
- Must select a fixedBinLevel between 1-9 when enabling binning.
- Suggested bin levels based on data extent.
- Heatmaps can be used as an alternative to clustering, opacity, and bloom to visualize
  overlapping point features.
- User can edit multiple layers with one REST call.
- As the user zooms in, the heatmap becomes irrelevant.
- Set a constraint on the MapView to prevent overzooming.
- Aggregation allows you to summarize large datasets with many features to layers
  with fewer features.
- Visible scale range defines the minimum and the maximum scales at which a dataset
  can be viewed.
- Setting visible scale range on your layers helps reduce the initial data download
  to the browser.
- Ensure Enable Editing is set to true in the feature layer's item page.
- Many of these techniques require 3D data, but some can be achieved with 2D data
  only.
- The elevation layer is not visible in a 3D scene, but you can render a basemap layer
  draped on top of the elevation layer.
- Data-driven styles answer questions about your data, such as Where? What? How much?
  When? or a combination of those questions.
- 3D city visualizations are realistic or abstract depictions of city infrastructure.
- Buildings are an important part of most 3D city visualizations.
- Class breaks are a good choice to use with percents, rates, ratios and other normalized
  data because the area or length or size of the feature is irrelevant.
- This example demonstrates how to visualize ranges of values normalized by the area
  of each polygon.
- This app visualizes the number of households per square mile.
- You can optionally add a default symbol to represent all values that don't fall
  within one of the breaks.
- You can add realistic and schematic 3D symbols to your scene using the WebStyleSymbol
  class.
- Only glTF version 2.0 is supported.
- The glTF file must contain a single scene.
- The scene can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, meshes and primitives of type
  TRIANGLE, TRIANGLE_STRIP or TRIANGLE_FAN. POINTS and LINES are not supported.
- Only materials of type Metallic-Roughness are supported.
- Animations, skinning and camera definitions are not supported.
- Overly thick outlines can hide small features and distract from the purpose of a
  visualization.
- For example, the image below shows outlines that are so thick they completely obscure
  the fill color of small polygons in the downtown Houston area.
- Dot density visualizations are sensitive to view scale.
- Setting a `maxScale` on the layer is important because dot density maps tend to
  become unreadable at larger scales.
- Provides hundreds of 2D and 3D web style symbols out-of-the-box.
- Includes colorblind-friendly color ramps suitable for any background.
- Using more than one visual variable adds complexity to the visualization.
- You should always carefully consider whether using multiple variables in one view
  is preferable to displaying separate views of the data.
- A dot density renderer requires a list of attributes, a dotValue, and optionally
  a referenceScale.
- Currently, the pie chart style is the only chart-based renderer available.
- Pie charts should be used with caution due to difficulties in perceiving differences
  in area.
- Geocoding can include address geocoding, place geocoding, reverse geocoding, and
  batch geocoding.
- Accessing the device location with the Geolocation API is not supported on insecure
  origins. Therefore, to use the Locate and Track components, the tutorial must run
  on HTTPS.
- If you have not previously allowed your browser to use your location, the browser
  will ask for permission before accessing the device location.
- Create an API key with privileges for Location services > Basemaps and Location
  services > Geocoding.
- Requires an ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account.
- Use discretion when clustering polygon and polyline features, as the underlying
  data could be misrepresented.
- By default, the cluster symbol always summarizes the features in the cluster.
- Places for parks should be displayed on the map.
- Aggregate features to bins to visualize density.
- Requires ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account
- ArcGIS Online is a GIS mapping, analytics, data hosting, and content management
  software as a service (SaaS) product.
- HeatmapRenderer has several key properties including radius and colorStops.
- Dynamic heatmaps require scale constraints to prevent overzooming.
- Static heatmaps maintain consistent density across scales.
- Aggregation is a data preprocessing step usually done before visualizing data in
  a web map.
- Setting visible scale range on your layers also helps reduce the initial data download
  to the browser.
- The Scene component displays a basemap and earthquake data that is displayed below
  the ground plane.
- Enable navigation below the ground to permit exploring the earthquakes.
- Uses createModel to create a new heat chart model with the feature layer.
- Uses various properties and methods from the heat chart model to customize the chart.
- Visualizes average hotel price for each day of the year.
- Run your code to display the chart.
- Use <arcgis-chart> component to specify layer item ID and chart index.
- Use <arcgis-charts-action-bar> component inside <arcgis-chart> to specify its slot.
- Data visualization can be difficult and time consuming.
- Sometimes a style looks good at one scale, but is unsuccessful at other scales.
- The decision you make for one map may not be suitable for another.
- Setting a minScale on the layer is important.
- Setting a maxScale on the layer is also important.
- Users are particularly susceptible to this when the dotValue is set to 1.
- Accessing the device location with the Geolocation API is not supported on insecure
  origins.
- Requires ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account.
- Requires an API key with Location services privileges.
- Create an API key with the privileges for Location services > Basemaps and Location
  services > Geocoding.
- Use a Calcite Select component to provide a list of several categories from which
  to choose.
- Charts are used to visualize data in a graphical format.
- The package includes a charts action bar component.
- Loads feature layer from portalItem with id 'a8fbe2753beb4cd4aeef4d47e5e32a7c' for
  New York City hotel data.
- Visualizes average hotel price for each day of the year
- Colors represent different price ranges
- Promise that resolves when the setup process is complete.
- Chart title visibility is dependent on subtitle text.
- Legend title is not supported yet.
- Routing service can solve complex network problems such as creating an optimized
  route to visit many destinations.
- Input parameters are necessary to solve the route.
- A routing service is a service that uses network analysis and streets data to calculate
  the most effective path and turn-by-turn directions on a street network.
- Create an API key with the required privileges for Location services.
- This service is currently only available if you have an ArcGIS Location Platform
  account.
