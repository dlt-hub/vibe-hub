notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Backstage
- The private key should be stored in the PKCS#8 format.
- The public key should be stored in the SPKI format.
- We will stop using default exports except when absolutely necessary.
- We will actively work to remove them from our codebases, being as explicit as possible.
- We will actively work to rework the export structure in our codebase, prioritizing
  the library packages such as @backstage/core-components and @backstage/backend-common.
- To keep our codebase up to date, we have decided that React.FC and React.SFC should
  be avoided in our codebase when adding new code.
- We will gradually remove the current usage of React.FC and React.SFC from our codebase.
- A little more code to write
- Gradually will replace the codebase with msw
- The catalog file should be named catalog-info.yaml
- This name is a default, not a requirement.
- We will need to audit the current places Date/Times are being displayed in the UI
  and update them to follow this ADR.
- We will need to keep in mind for reviewing PRs going forward to follow this ADR,
  or find/create a linting rule to automate this in the review process.
- Using multiple HTTP packages for data fetching increases the complexity and the
  support burden of keeping said package up to date.
- We will gradually transition away from third party packages such as `axios`, `got`
  and others.
- All code that is executed in Node.js (including backend and CLIs) should use the
  native `fetch` for HTTP data fetching
- Isomorphic packages should have a dependency on the `cross-fetch` package for mocking
  and type definitions.
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- Certain tests may need to be rewritten to use `msw` 2.x or newer instead, which
  uses a newer version of the interceptors.
