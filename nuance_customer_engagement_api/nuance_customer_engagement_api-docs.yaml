  - 'Cookie-based session authentication where a session cookie obtained from login
    is passed via the -b flag in curl requests (or Cookie header in other clients).
    The same cookie can be used for multiple sessions. Alternatively, OAuth2 token-based
    access is available: create a client in the oauth_client_details table with client_id
    and client_secret, send a POST request to the Nuance OAuth Server to obtain an
    access_token from the JSON response, then use that token in subsequent API requests.
    Tokens can be refreshed when expired. Rate limiting is configurable per user account
    via the Portal interface (Admin > User Management > Edit User > API Settings tab)
    by setting the Number of Requests Allowed per Second value.'
  - Nuance uses OAuth2 with the password grant type. Send a POST request to https://{auth.nuance.com}/oauth-server/oauth/token
    with an Authorization header containing base64-encoded apiClientId:apiClientSecret
    in Basic auth format. Include client_id, grant_type set to password, username,
    and password as form-urlencoded body parameters. The response contains an access
    token valid for access_token_validity_sec (900 seconds in the example) and a refresh_token
    valid for refresh_token_validity_sec (9000 seconds). Supported scopes are read,
    write, historic, and realtime. Use the returned access_token in subsequent API
    requests.
  - The API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Extract the access_token from
    the JSON response and include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>"
    for subsequent API requests. When the token expires after the time specified in
    expires_in (in seconds), use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token.
  - The API uses session-based authentication via HTTPS with secure cookies. Authenticate
    by POST to https://api.<<clientname>>.digital.nuance.com/j_spring_security_check
    with form parameters j_username, j_password, and submit=Login; capture the returned
    cookie and include it in subsequent requests using the -b/--cookie flag. Close
    sessions with a GET request to http://api.<<clientname>>.digital.nuance.com/logout
    passing the session cookie.

  - API token authentication is required. Tokens are obtained through an auth server
    token exchange and then sent with requests to the User Management API. Consult
    the API token authentication and typical auth server token exchange URL documentation
    for specific header names, token formats, and exchange endpoint details.
