auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/apis/management/general-usage:
  - API key authentication using Bearer token scheme. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <api-key>". The header name is "Authorization" and the value
    format is "Bearer " followed by your api-key. This applies to all requests to
    the API.
  - 'API requests require Bearer token authentication. Include the API key in the
    Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>". The Content-Type and
    Accept headers should both be set to "application/vnd.api+json".'
  - 'API requests require a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" where <api-key> is your API key.
    Additionally, S3 upload credentials use s3_access_key and s3_secret_key fields
    for authentication to AWS S3.'
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token. Send the API key as a Bearer token in
    the Authorization header with format "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>".'
  - 'Authorization is required using a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" where <api-key> is your API
    key.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/apis/management/general-usage:
  - Pagination uses `currentPage` and `totalPages` response fields for direct page
    access. The `sort` parameter (query string, comma-separated field names, optional)
    controls result ordering, with ascending default and descending available by prepending
    a dash to field names.
  - Pagination uses offset-based parameters with response metadata. Request pagination
    via query parameters (not shown in excerpt but implied by meta structure); response
    includes meta.pagination object with currentPage (0-indexed), pageSize (default
    20), hasNextPage, hasPreviousPage, totalPages, and totalRecords to control iteration.
  - 'The response includes pagination metadata with the following fields: currentPage
    (0-indexed), hasNextPage (boolean), hasPreviousPage (boolean), nextPage, pageSize
    (default 20), previousPage, totalPages, and totalRecords. However, no request
    parameters for controlling pagination are documented in the provided excerpt.'
  - Use query parameters `page[number]` (zero-indexed) and `page[size]` (minimum 1)
    to paginate. The response includes paging metadata to navigate remaining pages.
    Page sizes have maximum values for performance; developers must chain multiple
    calls to fetch entire lists.
