auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.codyhosterman.com/2014/07/powershell-and-pure-storage-rest-api-scripting/:
  - Authentication for Pure Storage FlashArray REST API requires obtaining an API
    token via a POST request to the /api/1.1/auth/apitoken endpoint with username
    and password credentials in the request body, then using that token in subsequent
    API calls. The credentials are sent as JSON fields "username" and "password" in
    the POST body to acquire the token.
- information_source; https://www.codyhosterman.com/2020/07/powershell-authentication-with-flasharray-rest-2-x/:
  - 'Authentication uses a two-step token-based flow: first, send an initial API token
    in the "api-token" header to POST /api/2.2/login, then use the returned "x-auth-token"
    response header in subsequent requests.


    Key details: Initial request header is "api-token" containing the API token. Login
    response includes "x-auth-token" header which must be extracted and sent as "x-auth-token"
    header in all following API calls.'
  - Bearer token authentication is used with an Authorization header. First obtain
    an access token via username/password authentication (using the Pure Storage PowerShell
    SDK's New-PfaArray cmdlet or equivalent REST 1.x endpoint), then send the token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>". The token can be extracted
    from the response JSON field access_token and reused across requests. REST 2.x
    requires OAuth2, but legacy API tokens from REST 1.x can be converted to session
    tokens for REST 2.x compatibility.
  - 'The API uses a two-step authentication process: first, POST an api-token credential
    to the /api/2.2/login endpoint, then extract the x-auth-token response header
    and include it in subsequent requests as the x-auth-token header.'

  - Pure Storage FlashArray REST API uses token-based authentication. To authenticate,
    send a POST request to the /api/1.1/auth/apitoken endpoint with a JSON body containing
    username and password fields. The response returns an API token that must be included
    in subsequent requests via the Authorization header as a bearer token.
