pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.gmelius.com:
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, controls number of results)
    and from (query parameter, optional, controls starting position). The documentation
    snippet is incomplete, so full details on defaults, maximum values, and response
    structure for pagination are not provided.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, pagination limit) and from (query
    parameter, optional, pagination start position). The response structure does not
    show explicit pagination metadata fields like next, has_more, or total_count,
    so navigation logic cannot be fully determined from this documentation.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position and limit specifies the maximum number of results to return per request.
    Both parameters are required.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (pagination limit) and from (pagination
    start point). The response includes a total_count field in the data object indicating
    total results available.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (optional, sets page size) and from (optional,
    sets pagination start position). Response contains data.sequences array with sequence
    objects.
