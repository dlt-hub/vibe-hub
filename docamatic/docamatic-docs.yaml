auth_info:
- information_source; https://docamatic.com/documentation:
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    The token should be included as ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' where YOUR_API_KEY
    is replaced with an actual API key value obtained from the service configuration
    (services.docamatic.key).'
  - The Docamatic API uses Bearer Token authentication with API keys. Include your
    API key in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". The API key should
    be stored in the environment variable DOCAMATIC_API_KEY and passed in the Authorization
    header of all HTTPS requests. Rate limiting is set to 120 requests per minute
    by default, returning HTTP 429 when exceeded.
