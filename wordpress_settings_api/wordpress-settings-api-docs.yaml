notes:
- No confusion about nonces or anything along those lines.
- There’s very little good documentation for it.
- The tutorial is intended to show you how things work, not to be copied and used
  as-is.
- Settings are stored in a table called wp_options.
- Use get_option and add_option methods to access and store settings.
- Uses WordPress API for plugin information.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Users only download the languages they actually need, instead of all of them.
- New translations can be approved and pushed as updates independently of the plugin
  or theme.
- Some videos display very wonky sometimes.
- You can extend this further to use postMessage for real-time changing of settings,
  if you like.
- Custom controls using complex javascript and such can be done as well.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Includes support for language packs.
- Plugin is licensed under the GPL Version 2
- Gravatar Box allows users to display Gravatars alongside comments.
- This plugin doesn’t execute code in posts. It creates a sidebar widget which will
  run PHP code.
- Widgets of any kind are not included in a WordPress export/import operation.
- Great plugin, but on multisite, only works with network administrator role.
- This plugin is not working with PHP 8.0.
- I get a lot of email nowadays, so I can’t guarantee a response in a reasonable time
  period.
- Try to include as much information as you can, there’s a better chance of it actually
  answering your question this way.
- The plugin will only filter JPG images to avoid the overhead of recompressing PNGs
  and to avoid breaking animated GIF files.
- Filters are easily expandable by creating a function and calling imagefx_register_filter().
- This is always the wrong way to do it.
- This API is in beta mode and may change.
- Use Site-Specific Plugins for code changes to avoid issues with theme upgrades.
- Backward compatibility is sorta fuzzy on parts of it at the moment
- The plugin will only filter JPG images, to avoid the overhead of recompressing PNGs
  and to avoid breaking animated GIF files.
- I haven’t tested these filters extensively.
- Text Domain must be identical to the plugin or theme's slug.
- Text Domain header is required for effective translation.
- Function calls load_plugin_textdomain or load_theme_textdomain should be in a function
  attached to the appropriate action hook.
- Files will be named 'slug-locale.mo', where slug is the plugin or theme’s slug.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Using the Theme Customizer allows for live preview and modification of theme settings.
- You have to use an Ottopress to get fresh squeezed Otto.
- Loving the ability to conditionally show/hide a setting based on the value of a
  different setting.
- Using the Customize link works with the currently active theme only.
- Adding ?theme=themedemo allows links to customize non-active themes.
- Some objects may return null values unless specified with a default.
- The Customize link is available on the main Theme selection page.
- Existing settings can be used with the Theme Customizer without significant changes.
- Everything I went over above is enough to add new sections to the customizer, put
  controls in them, and then to have the preview show your changes after a slight
  delay when the page refreshes.
- Transport defines how your setting change gets from the place where you changed
  it into the preview pane. The default setting for this is 'refresh'. An alternative
  setting is named 'postMessage'.
- Nonces are easy to implement for protecting actions in WordPress.
- Always include action and object ID in the nonce for specificity.
- Theme Customizer is a new feature in WordPress 3.4.
- No extra code needed to support built-in Custom Header and Custom Background functionality.
- Nonces are easy to implement.
- Uses comment_form function to standardize the comments form.
- Upgrade process is slightly more involved for this one.
- It is recommended that you deactivate the old SFC plugins before upgrading.
- Plugins should only try to do one thing, and to do it well.
- If you have a plugin or a theme or any type of code that “does something” in WordPress,
  then you need to protect that action with a nonce.
- Whenever you make a direct SQL call, any variable inputs to that query must go through
  a prepare() cycle.
- Uses postMessage transport for real-time updates in the customizer.
- 'Disadvantage: Doesn’t work in IE7.'
- This is not official.
- It’s not supported.
- It may not even work for you.
- It certainly won’t work if they change things.
- Text-domain must be identical to the plugin or theme's slug.
- The 'Text Domain' header is required for loading language pack files.
- 'Make sure your theme is ready for language packs by following this essential guide
  from Otto: Language Packs 101 – Prepwork.'
- Any calls to load_plugin_textdomain should be in a function attached to the “plugins_loaded”
  action hook.
- Any calls to load_theme_textdomain should be in a function attached to the “after_setup_theme”
  action hook.
- Any calls to load_plugin_textdomain should be in a function attached to the 'plugins_loaded'
  action hook.
- Any calls to load_theme_textdomain should be in a function attached to the 'after_setup_theme'
  action hook.
- Text Domain must be identical to the plugin or theme’s slug.
- Domain Path for plugins defaults to the plugin’s own root directory.
- 'If you got the “Breaking change: API deprecations” email from Facebook today, then
  you are probably using the SFC-Login plugin, or have at some point.'

- Default posts per page is set to 7.
- Enables Infinite Scroll feature for WordPress themes.
- 'Infinite Scroll supports two methods of loading new posts: ''scroll'' or ''click''.'
- Default setting shows 7 posts initially.
- Uses Infinite Scroll feature in themes to load more posts dynamically.
- Uses Facebook API for migration and debugging tools
- Blocking my own content from being served is NOT a security measure.
- Everything I’m talking about here, including the code, is in beta mode. It will
  be subject to change.
- Uses postMessage transport for instant setting changes.
- Verbose page rules can add much more than one rule per page.
- This is not a tutorial, as such. You are expected to already be translating your
  code in some way, and to have a basic grasp on it.
- Traffic-wise I serve about 6000 page views a day, all told.
- Bandwidth tends to be in the 1.5 GB per day range.
- SSH access is a must-have.
- Speed would be nice.
- Many of you may have nothing to fix. Some of you may just need a header change.
- This blog features a custom theme.
- Child themes are used for customization.
- Uses Infinite Scroll feature for loading posts.
- By default, shows 7 posts only, adjustable with 'posts_per_page' option.
- You can extend this further to use postMessage for real-time changing of settings.
- WordPress brought the Customize link to the surface in a later version.

- The Simple Facebook Connect plugin has not used the FeatureLoader.js script since
  before version 1.0.

- Twitter added oEmbed provider support to their API.
- Facebook's frictionless sharing is a privacy invading, oversharing, useless-result
  creating nightmare.
- The filters I've implemented are mostly pretty simple.
- You do NOT need an SSL certificate to use SFC, and you will continue to not need
  one after October 1st.
- Old versions, including 1.0, will cease to function.
- Secrets are supposed to be secret. So keep your Facebook Application Secret a real
  secret.
- Pretty simple to manipulate images in this way.
- One thing I don’t like is that the +1 button only works for people who are logged
  into a GMail account.
- Custom taxonomies are great but not for everything.
- Postmeta is specific information for the post item itself.
- The only downside to it is that sometimes you need to ask the user for their account
  information in order to be able to get the access you need.
- Determining whether a piece of code is malicious or not is basically equivalent
  to the halting problem.
- Regular backups are critically important to have.
- Security is an ever changing thing.
- Don't trust dodgy theme sites. Get your free themes from WordPress.org Extend-Themes
  instead.
- DNS works as a decentralized system.
- Changing nameservers can lead to long propagation delays.
- Advanced taxonomy queries are cool, but be aware that complex queries are going
  to be slower.
- There is a minor problem in the way the YOURLS plugin handles the WP Shortlink API.
- The count API is private but can be accessed by appending a URL to the endpoint.
- Child themes can override templates and functions from parent themes.
- Never give out your Application Secret. Use the Reset Secret Key link if necessary.
- Capitalize URLs correctly. The leading 'www' or lack of one matters.
- The latest plugin adds a Facebook activity feed widget to WordPress.
- Simple Twitter Connect now enables @anywhere support with no extra configuration.

- Non-technical users can safely ignore this post.
- Enhanced Comments are optional and default to off, even after you make these changes.
- Old themes will continue to work fine in WordPress 2.7.
- The comment_form function is new to 3.0.
- Theme authors should start modifying their themes to use this instead of the existing
  big-ugly-comment-form code.
- Some objects like Comment may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Some themes create their own ‘textarea’ field, resulting in duplicate comment text
  fields.
- This list is by no means complete. It's just off the top of my head for now.
- Automatic feed links are added by calling add_theme_support('automatic-feed-links');
- Uses function_exists to check for backward compatibility with comments.php
- Adding this code to a theme’s functions.php file will make the theme use the 'legacy.comments.php'
  for older non-2.7 installations.
- The new comments loop automatically puts every comment into an LI tag, and threads
  them as well, with embedded UL/LI tags.

- The malware installs a PHP Shell backdoor and a spamming system.
- The code does not run on localhost installs.
- Fixing a website 'hack' is actually a fairly heavy technical thing to do.
- Avoid using wp-load.php in plugins for better performance
- Use wp_enqueue_script() and wp_localize_script() for passing parameters to JavaScript
- It is not possible to determine the location of the wp-load.php file accurately
  from a theme or plugin.
- WordPress loads plugins/themes, not the other way around.
- Custom Post Types are not Posts or Pages and do not show up in the blog or feed.
- Post types are NOUNS. Taxonomy terms are ADJECTIVES. Taxonomies themselves are related
  groups of adjectives.
- Presentation on Post Formats at the WordPress Memphis Meetup
- Uses wp_localize_script to pass PHP variables to JavaScript.
- The count API is considered private but the information can be accessed.
- Disregard the previous comment, this javascript is exactly what I was looking for.
- Uses wp_localize_script for passing PHP variables to JavaScript.
- Stop including wp-load. It’s just wrong. Let WordPress load itself, and make your
  plugin do the output it needs to produce in the right places.
- Data is returned in JSONP format.
- Simple Twitter Connect 0.7 now automatically enables your site to run the new @anywhere
  code. With zero extra configuration steps.
- 'WordPress: Ver. 4.4.2'
- 'Server: siteground GrowBig'
- 'WordPress MU Domain Mapping: Version 0.5.5.1'
- Never give out your Application Secret.
- URLs must be absolutely accurate. Capitalization matters.
- You have specified an App Domain but have not specified a Site URL or a Mobile Web
  URL
- Facebook basically dropped the ball and never actually finished this code or turned
  it on or something.
- You MUST select 'Brand or Product', and in the dropdown you MUST select 'App'.
- Make the name of the Page EXACTLY THE SAME as the name of the application.
- You can do the same thing without SFC, it’s just that SFC makes it easy for you
  by putting all the proper header codes into your page to make it work seamlessly.
- Facebook will be eliminating App Profile Walls entirely in February
- The URLs must be the URLs that are actually used by your site. Capitalization matters.
  The leading 'www' or lack of one matters.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication
- 'Note to users: If you got the “Breaking change: API deprecations” email from Facebook
  today, then you are probably using the SFC-Login plugin, or have at some point.'
- Version 0.24 removes the code they are deprecating from the SFC-Login plugin. So
  upgrade and you’ll be fine.
- However, note that SFC is no longer compatible with WordPress versions prior to
  3.0. Upgrade WordPress to 3.0 or later before upgrading SFC.
- Uses Facebook's new register plugin functionality
- Auto-connect existing accounts to Facebook based on matching email addresses
- When the top two boxes in Authentication Settings are unchecked, the Application
  becomes an 'External Website' as far as Facebook is concerned.
- The URLs in the Connect Settings must be absolutely accurate. Capitalization matters.
- Go to the Tools->Options menu. In there, find the Advanced->Connections tab. Turn
  off the option to use port 80 and 443.

- The 'files' name is reserved and cannot be used as a post slug.
- Attachments imported into the new files structure may require fixing links in posts.
- An actual working implementation of the WP_Filesystem can be found in my Pluginception
  plugin.
- WordPress uses a system called WP_Filesystem to make this safe.
- The WP_Filesystem can use a 'direct' method if the server is configured correctly.
- Using the WP_Filesystem is crucial for security when handling files.
- File ownership matters; permissions alone are not sufficient.
- If you’re reading a file, there’s no issues. If you’re updating a file, while there
  are no ownership issues, you shouldn’t be updating a file in a plugin or a theme
  because the updates will be lost when the plugin or theme is upgraded.
- Certain site transients would likely need to remain available for a long time, months,
  even.
- Adds a Google Buzz button to your content.
- The comment_form function standardizes the comments form.

- Does not activate on PNGs or GIFs.
- There is a small bug when using it with older posts combined with setting images
  to be organised by year/month.
- Changes to nameservers can take time to propagate across the internet.
- Use a nameserver that you have control over, and which you will almost never change.
- DNS is a caching system.
- TTL tells DNS caching servers when to drop the info and get fresh data.
- Keep nameserver location unchanged for as long as possible.
- Changes to nameservers take a long time to propagate.
- When changing nameservers, the internet takes time to adjust.
- Keep the nameserver location unchanged for as long as possible.

- Switch the 'Encrypted Access Token' setting to ‘Enabled’.
- Scanning is pointless.
- Requires valid site_id to fetch comments.
- Rate limiting applies to API requests.
- WordPress has a huge amount of gallery functionality built right in.

- Provides guidance on creating a WordPress photo gallery without a plugin.
- Some images may not have image_meta in them.
- The +1 button does work for Apps users when the account has joined the experiment.
- This is mainly intended as a demo.
- There are more full-featured plugins for this sort of thing in the plugins directory.
- Advanced Taxonomy queries use a new parameter to the query functions called 'tax_query'.
- Be aware that complex queries are going to be slower.
- The audio player will only show up on your site. People reading through an RSS reader
  or some other method won’t see it, they’ll just see the plain audio link and can
  download the file.
- It only handles MP3 formats.
- Only handles MP3 formats.
- Only converts links on lines by themselves.
- QR Codes are like visual links.
- Using a shortlink system you control allows you to change the payment link without
  changing the shortlink.
- Will not convert inline audio links within paragraphs.
- This is mainly intended as a demo. There’s more full featured plugins for this sort
  of thing in the plugins directory.
- People rarely look at the documentation, but inline help might be worth a shot
- Might reduce your need for end-user support
- Uses basic authentication with username and password
- Plugin auto-shortens links on demand
- Adds a Shortlink input box with the shortlink in it.
- Configuration is fairly straightforward.
- Minor problem in the way the YOURLS plugin handles the WP Shortlink API.
- Some plugins may not handle edge cases well.
- Very little good documentation for it.
- 'Common case: Making your own settings page.'
