notes:
- 'Error sending STUN request: Invalid argument'
- The biggest problem with Voice Assist is that it only supports the codec OPUS.
- Documentation is incomplete.
- Some calls using Opus codec sound noisy/scratchy on Chan_SIP extensions.
- Need to switch to pj_sip to upgrade to FreePBX 17.
- Custom extensions matching inbound DID work for routing calls.
- Dynamic Routes module is free to download and use.
- Consider using Asterisk's sqlite3 'astdb' for lower impact querying.
- Custom extension in 3 queues and one ring group
- Mail function works in CentOS
- All endpoints are currently unavailable.
- Requires setup of connected app in FreePBX
- The Fax module in UCP reports 'Missing a temporary folder' after module updates.
- The problem reoccurs daily and may require restarting httpd service.
- 'To enable DND: ‘database put DND 1001 YES’'
- DND is not activated if the command is not capitalized correctly.
- Solved, it was a NAT issue
- The trunk is registered and shows 'Available'.
- The extension 1041 is online and reachable internally.
- There are no IVRs or Time Conditions currently active.
- Trunks are configured over TLS in FreePBX and pass a separate contact on each trunk.
- Outbound calls on one trunk may affect the ability of the other trunk to receive
  calls until re-registered.
- NAT settings under Asterisk SIP/PJSIP settings must have the external address set
  as the public IP address.
- Ensure that RTP and SIP ports are allowed through any firewalls.
- SIP/2.0 504 Server Time-out observed for outbound calls.
- Configuring it to link to HA was a little too large of a headache.
- I have a very small FreePBX inside my firewall dealing with ha HAA Voice load.
- Make sure the ONLY Codec selected is opus.
- Firewall flagged outbound to 144.172.105.25 as suspicious
- Research is ongoing, but please refer to the FreePBX security reporting policy on
  GitHub for help raising specific issues.
- If you are in the USA, or intend to send messages to the USA, be aware that you
  will need to register under the US 10DLC rules.
- Since you must use an API, which is often used in automated tasks that run between
  systems on their own (not requiring human interaction) they fall under the DLC rules
  in the US which govern business sms to customers.
- FreePBX has a text to speech engine built in.
- The built-in text to speech module is reported to have poor quality.
- The module has a 'prefix' field which may not work as expected.
- The issue was caused by another module being configured incorrectly and being used
  by Web Callback.
- You cannot edit this. It’s part of a commercial module and encoded.
- Ensure proper NXXNXXXXXX match in outbound routes.
- The issue was caused by another module being configured incorrectly and being used
  by Web Callback. This was a PEBCAK issue not a FreePBX issue.
- Ensure that the API is enabled in FreePBX settings.
- Chan_SIP is being phased out and not receiving updates or bug fixes.
- PJSIP is preferred for newer installations due to better stability and features.
- Some speed dial buttons work while others do not, related to area codes.
- Commercial Modules require proper setup and support tickets may be necessary for
  issues.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in FreePBX
- Asterisk moved to sqlite3 more than 4 years ago.
- There are multiple phone books available in the FreePBX GUI.
- Protocol ttp not supported or disabled in libcurl
- Some API responses may vary based on configuration
- PJSIP is preferred; Chan_SIP is deprecated and not receiving updates.
- Agent should always see the internal customer code on MicroSIP throughout the call.
- Repeated failed REGISTER attempts against one extension mitigated by changing its
  Secret, setting Max Contacts=1, and enabling Intrusion Detection.
- Some speed dial buttons work with local area code 204, but not with newer area codes.
- Asterisk moved to sqlite3 more than 4 years ago
- There are more than one 'phone book' available in the FreePBX GUI
- HT503 does not have Denmark as an option in its slic settings
- 'Set the HT503 up with slic: norway, caller id scheme: etsi-dtmf, vocoder: ilbc'
- Currently I have Authentication set to None as well as registration set to none.
- I have tried multiple configurations, I can get incoming telco–>HT841–>freepbx to
  work no problem.
- Agent sees customer’s real number instead of internal customer code
- Repeated failed REGISTER attempts mitigated by changing Secret and enabling Intrusion
  Detection
- Stage method 2 would indeed cause a 403 error, but you switched it to 1 and nothing
  changed.
- The HT has various security settings that will reject calls if the remote IP address,
  username, etc. aren’t as expected.
- Another option is to set up the HT in the ‘usual’ way, where it registers to the
  PBX.
- The ht503 doesn't have Denmark as an option in its slic settings, but apparently
  Norway has the same specs.
- The connected phone is simply not showing any life and has been tested multiple
  times.
- The development environment in the documents is a waste of time because it doesn’t
  work right.
- Authentication set to None
- Registration set to None
- Outgoing calls without registration checked off
- You just need to create your account on https://elevenlabs.io and generate your
  API key and add it on the module.
- You can start with a free version, or submit a service for $5/month.
- Stage method 1 was set to solve the issue.
- Authentication is set to none for the trunks.
- Registration is off for the FXO profile.
- The theme is delivered with Framework module. So it’s not really easy to change
  manually CSS and Less files. Because, after a Framework update your theme will be
  overrided.
- The development environment setup is not fully tested or reviewed since moving to
  FreePBX v17.
- Uses chan_pjsip compatibility issue with Gigaset SIP stacks.
- SIP trunking is configured IP peer to peer trunk with the PBX in a LAN behind a
  NAT.
- You need to create your account on https://elevenlabs.io and generate your API key
- You can look through the open source code and see where there are conditions that
  look for alternative style sheets.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Max contacts option doesn’t seem to be useful in this use case.
- Uses FreePBX 17 with Asterisk 21
- No firewall or NAT changes were made during the migration
- SIP trunking is configured IP peer to peer trunk with the PBX in a LAN behind a
  NAT
- Make sure you have forwarded rtp ports 10000-20000 including sip port 5060
- FPBX 17 is ONLY meant to run on a UEFI system
- Users have reported issues with the Google Drive link for recovery firmware.
- Debian installation issues related to web filters.
- RAID setups won’t work right without UEFI
- Special recovery firmware will make them available to use with FreePBX and eliminate
  Verizon’s custom firmware.
- I finally just deleted the SIP trunk with DID For Sale and created a new one, put
  my DID numbers down the new one. I then deleted the SIP Trunk on my FreePBX server
  and recreated the new SIP trunk on it. And it has been working for 6 hours now.
  It has never worked for that long before.
- It is working after having the web filter guy get that website unblocked, it continued
  for a good 5-10 minutes through a very long scripts.
- Since we have changed the IP address I have noticed this error.
- I finally just deleted the SIP trunk with DID For Sale and created a new one, put
  my DID numbers down the new one.
- The beep seems to be hard coded into the paging regardless of settings changed in
  the GUI.
- Hardcoded 'beep' at the end of announcements. Cannot be changed except with security
  warnings.
- Uses User-Agent header to avoid 403 forbidden error
- Minimum number of comments required to trust the rating is set to 3
- Minimum number of searches required to trust the rating is set to 0
- FreePBX word is coming from the DASHBOARD_FREEPBX_BRAND setting so you can change
  this setting as per your requirements.
- 'Site uses Cloudflare: Same Origin Policy.'
- This needs to be installed with a huge grain of salt. There are numerous issues
  with the code from potential SQL injections to world writable directories exposed
  with zero protection.
- Do not install this public facing THIS IS NOT RAN IN THE CLOUD!!
- The word 'FreePBX' comes from the DASHBOARD_FREEPBX_BRAND setting.
- Ensure to update the SIP server address and provisioning address in the old base
  file.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication.
- Ensure the endpoint manager is properly configured.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup.
- Uses chan_pjsip for better support in multi-homed situations.
- SIP Customer IP Block was 10.0.20.138/29
- SIP Core Network 172.45.31.200 and 219 for a backup
- Cannot access web admin over VPN on roaming connections without public IP added
  to trusted list.
- Provisioning of phones requires public IP to be in the trusted list.
- 'Each 4 hrs I lose internet and need to reboot the VM of not my trunk get: all circuit
  are busy now.'
- VPN subnet must be added to trusted list to access web admin.
- Provisioning requires public IP to be added to trusted list.
- 401 Wrong Dialling Pattern Error during outbound calls may occur due to incorrect
  dialing patterns configured.
- API requires authentication to access data
- The public IP cannot be accessed from outside.
- The FreePBX VM has both a private and public IP directly assigned (no NAT).
- You can’t have multiple type=identify sections matching on exactly the same conditions.
- The only thing I see when I expand the outgoing call is the LAN ip from the phone
  is being passed (192.168.1.154) and I believe PBX is expecting the WAN IP.
- Some firewall configuration reject continuations of fragmented UDP messages, because
  they don’t contain the port number. If that is the problem here, you need to reduce
  the number of codecs offered by the GrandStream, switch to TCP, or add a firewall
  rule to let through continuation frames of fragmented UDP messages.
- In the Grandstream phone, enable only ulaw (PCMU or G.711u) and alaw codecs.
- No auth objects matching realm/algorithm(s) '' from challenge found.
- Could be due to wrong username/pass or authentication is set to none instead of
  outbound.
- Set the outbound caller ID in the extension settings for each extension and remove
  it from the trunk.
- You can put an external number in a ring group and it will ring it, you just need
  to make sure there is a “#” at the end.
- Reduce the number of codecs offered by the GrandStream, switch to TCP, or add a
  firewall rule to let through continuation frames of fragmented UDP messages.
- Enabling only ulaw (PCMU or G.711u) and alaw codecs on the Grandstream phone resolved
  the issue.
- Uses TIMEOUT() function to limit call duration
- The L Dial() option can be used to notify the caller that this call will end in
  x amount of time
- Your provider may be limiting what you can send as valid Caller ID.
- FollowMe/forwarding keeps the original CID thus not matching as an extension that
  can use either of those routes.
- VPN is incorporated via directional radio, but not reliable enough for phone service.
- Default timeout is 5 seconds for dialing out.
- You have to go under trunks then go to advance setting of trunk you will see there
  send pai and sendrpid make sure to set correctly.
- The TIMEOUT() function is still present in Asterisk v21 and v22.
- API may have rate limits.
- Logs would be helpful to see what is happening.
- Issues configuring HT841 as a local trunk may occur.
- Try to upgrade your FreePBX all modules at the same time.
- From Gui, Select Voicemail and OTHER Disabled Module and Press to ENABLE and Upgrade.
- Usually the phone will ring in 4-5 seconds. It is better to check the FXO setting
  and dahdi_test for the status.
- Your problem is your “dialstrings” not being “closed”, if you dial something which
  is indeterminate then you will have to wait the default “timeout” (default is 5
  seconds) until the call completes.
- After purging voicemails, calls to the extension roll to voicemail without playing
  the recorded name or greeting.
- Some API calls may have rate limits
- FreePBX does not populate the route outbound in the invite to the IP address.
- The correct format for Request-URI is sip:my.proxy.com:5560\;lr.
- After purging voicemails, calls roll to voicemail without ringing or playing the
  recorded name or greeting.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- UCP showing errors at random times and session gets logged out
- Uses systemd service to manage FreePBX and MariaDB.
- Stopping MariaDB before FreePBX might result in lost CDRs, CELs, or other data.
- Setting apt configuration to always DO NOT overwrite existing configurations
- FreePBX stuffs this directly into the .conf file, where a ; starts a comment.
- Correct syntax for Request-URI is sip:my.proxy.com:5560\;lr
- Putting the CLI into the web GUI sounds like it could introduce some security concerns.
- The ttyd binary is available at Releases · tsl0922/ttyd · GitHub and there are plenty
  of options to make it pretty secure.
- No known quirks or limitations mentioned.
- Some important security issues fixed in the past several weeks
- The ttyd binary is available at https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd/releases
- The ttyd sessions end when you leave the page in the FreePBX GUI, and a new one
  starts on a new random port next time.
