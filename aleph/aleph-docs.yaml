notes:
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Ensure the uploaded spreadsheet is clean and well-organized for effective cross-referencing.
- Cross-referencing may take time depending on the size of the list.
- If you are receiving an error message after putting in your one time password, this
  issue is most likely caused by the current time on your phone or laptop.
- Your Aleph account’s username is the email address you used to register.
- It’s recommended to run the reconciliation service against a specific dataset on
  Aleph, rather than a full site.
- Starting Aleph in a development environment disabled many security measures.
- Most other configuration options use sensible defaults which means you do not need
  to adjust them unless you have specific requirements.
- Aleph supports OAuth/OpenID Connect identity providers, and we do recommend that
  you delegate authentication to a separate identity rather than using the built-in
  password authentication system.
- The how to guides in this section are intended for administrators operating their
  own Aleph instance.
- Entities can be browsed, imported, and exported in the FollowTheMoney data format.
- Users shouldn’t be able to change evidence stored within the system, such as data
  from public records databases, or leaked information.
- Aleph wants to accommodate extreme entities, within boundaries.
- Files are stored using a SHA1 hash of the file's contents for deduplication.
- The default spaCy models are trained on generic web content. They tend to show lower
  recall for (semi-)structured data such as listings from database websites.
- Aleph currently doesn’t display all extracted data in the UI.
- ElasticSearch does not support changing the field type in existing indexes.
- No way in Aleph to do 'exact' searches that return only results matching search
  terms character-by-character.
- Uses the Elasticsearch scroll API to iterate over entities in batches
- If fetching candidates and computing similarity score for a batch takes longer than
  the timeout, Elasticsearch will raise an error
- Cross-referencing process is a single task; if it fails, it is retried from the
  beginning
- 'Aleph only supports two permission levels: read access and write access.'
- Streaming entities can consume significant system resources, limiting access to
  users with write access or admin privileges.
- Make sure to configure your bucket to be private.
- Store the credentials file savely to prevent accidentally exposing it.
- If you want to allow only users in your organization to access your Aleph instance,
  make sure to select the correct account type.
- The JSON file needs to have a CORS header that matches your Aleph instance.
- It is important that you create intervals of your Aleph instance in regular intervals
  and before upgrading to new versions.
- Make sure to always verify that your backups are working as intended and that you
  are able to successfully restore your data from backups.
- If you have configured Aleph to use a separate database instance, make sure to create
  a separate backup of the FollowTheMoney store.
- We recommend that you always run a recent version of Aleph.
- In some cases, new Aleph versions may include breaking changes that include additional,
  manual steps in order to upgrade.
- Aleph ships with a built-in password authentication system.
- For production deployments, we recommend delegating authentication to an external
  identity provider.
- Aleph supports the OAuth2/OpenID Connect standards and works with a wide range of
  identity providers.
- Aleph includes CMS-like functionality that allows you to manage custom pages using
  Markdown files.
- After updating or creating new pages or translations, you need to restart Aleph
  to apply the changes.
- Aleph heavily relies on the default FollowTheMoney model.
- Please note that you may have to sync your custom model with the upstream default
  model when you upgrade Aleph.
- Do not remove or alter existing schemata or properties.
- Set the SENTRY_DSN configuration option to use the Sentry DSN of your project.
- Prometheus uses a pull-based model for metrics collection
- You shouldn’t publicly expose the Prometheus metrics port
- Set the LOG_FORMAT configuration option to JSON.
