auth_info:

  - Grant code exchange is required for add-on partners to interact with the Platform
    API. Exchange the oauth_grant:code from the provision request for an access_token
    and refresh_token by making a request to the token endpoint. The access_token
    is used to authenticate subsequent Platform API requests and is scoped to the
    specific add-on resource it was created for; use the refresh_token to obtain new
    access_tokens when the current one expires. Each add-on resource requires its
    own access_token, and all API responses will be scoped to that add-on resource.
  - HTTP Basic Authentication is required. The Authorization header must contain "Basic"
    followed by a base64-encoded string of "addon-slug:super-secret", where addon-slug
    is the add-on partner identifier and super-secret is the shared secret credential
    provided during partner setup.
  - Heroku provides an OAuth access token for authenticating with the Platform API
    for Partners during asynchronous deprovisioning workflows. The add-on must use
    this OAuth access token to authenticate requests when performing deprovisioning
    actions on the Heroku platform after receiving a deprovisioning request with the
    X-Async-Deprovision-Allowed header set to true.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used to obtain access tokens. Exchange an authorization
    code and client_secret via POST to /oauth/token with grant_type=authorization_code
    to receive an access_token (expires in seconds specified by expires_in, default
    28800), refresh_token (valid for add-on lifetime), and token_type Bearer. Use
    the access_token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}" for Platform
    API requests. Refresh tokens can be exchanged for new access tokens using the
    client_secret.
  - OAuth2 refresh token flow is used to obtain access tokens. Send a POST request
    to id.heroku.com:443/oauth/token with grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token,
    and client_secret as form-encoded parameters. The response includes access_token
    (expires in 28800 seconds by default), refresh_token, expires_in, and token_type.
    Use the access_token in the Authorization header to access the Platform API scoped
    to a single add-on resource.
