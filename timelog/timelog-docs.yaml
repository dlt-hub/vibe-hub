notes:
- TimeLog API is built on REST (Representational State Transfer).
- TimeLog guarantees solutions build on a given version of the TimeLog API will work
  three years from the release of that specific version.
- All access to the Transactional API requires a security token that is an information
  bearer for the authenticated user.
- The token is in most cases valid for 12 hours, but use the token property 'Expires'
  to ensure that you reuse the token as long as possible before renewing.
- Requires Reporting API credentials and a SiteCode.
- API ID and Password are necessary for authentication.
