notes:
- API supports parallel enhancements.
- API key is required for access.
- Uses OAuth2 for authentication.
- Uses OAuth2 for API access.
- Requires setup of connected app in TensorPix
- May experience delays during high traffic periods
- High quality webcams can cost over $300. TensorPix allows you to enhance videos
  for as little as $5.
- Uses OAuth2 authentication.
- TensorPix uses smart AI to remove blur from video online free.
- AI video denoiser can remove different types of noise, including grain, pixelation,
  and color noise.
- TensorPix offers a few free credits to test the AI video denoising tool before committing
  to buying credits or subscription plans.
- AI upscaling uses advanced algorithms to analyze and enhance video frames. It fills
  in details and sharpens images based on patterns learned from extensive data, resulting
  in higher-resolution footage without losing quality.
- The API supports video and image generation with AI.
- No bulky software or high-end PC needed.
- No download needed. TensorPix is a fully online Instagram video enhancer.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in TensorPix
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
