auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.olx.ro/api/doc:
  - Access token is required for authentication. Send the access_token as an authorization
    credential when making requests to the API endpoints.
  - Access token is required for authorization. Send the access_token as an authorization
    credential in the request headers to authenticate with the OLX Production Server
    API endpoints for user business data operations.
  - 'Access tokens are passed in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens with each
    request. The token is obtained via OAuth2 with three supported grant types: authorization_code
    (for users), client_credentials (for clients), and refresh_token (for either).
    Access tokens expire after a duration specified in the expires_in field, while
    refresh tokens are valid for one month (2592000 seconds) and can be renewed. Scopes
    define specific permissions, with default scopes being v2 read write. The authorization_code
    flow requires a client_id, response_type=code, and state parameter in the /oauth/authorize/
    endpoint, along with a registered Callback URL. Access and refresh tokens should
    be stored securely.'
  - 'Authorization header with Bearer token is required. Send `Authorization: Bearer
    ACCESS_TOKEN` along with `Content-Type: application/json` and `Version: 2.0` headers
    when posting adverts to the `/api/partner/adverts` endpoint. The ACCESS_TOKEN
    represents the currently authenticated user''s credentials.'
  - OAuth 2.0 is required for all API requests. Include the OAuth access token as
    a string in every request; refer to https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/definitions/
    for OAuth2 standard details. The exact method of passing the token (header name,
    parameter name, etc.) is not specified in this documentation excerpt.
