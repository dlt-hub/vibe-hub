notes:
- This API documentation assumes you are using 3.2.0 and higher versions of ansible-tower-cli.
  If you are using a lower version than 3.2.0, there is no guarantee API usages in
  this documentation would work as expected.
- you will be prompted for a password, then an OAuth2 token will be created in AWX/Tower
  and used for future Authentication.
- Only versions of tower-cli can successfully interact with only a certain subset
  of versions of Ansible Tower or AWX.
