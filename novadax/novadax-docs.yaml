auth_info:
- information_source; https://doc.novadax.com/en-US/:
  - API AccessKey authentication is required. Include a valid AccessKey in requests,
    ensure the used IP is whitelisted, timestamp is in UTC, parameters are sorted
    by ASCII order, encoding is utf-8, GET requests use HTTP form, POST requests use
    JSON format with Content-Type:application/json header, and the signature must
    be encoded. Sub-account operations can be passed via the X-Nova-Account-Id header.
  - 'API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Include three headers in
    requests: X-Nova-Access-Key (your AccessKey), X-Nova-Signature (HMAC-SHA256 hash
    of formatted string using your SecretKey), and X-Nova-Timestamp (current time
    in milliseconds). For GET requests, the signature is computed from a formatted
    string containing the HTTP method, request URL, sorted query parameters, and timestamp.
    For POST requests, the body is included in the signature computation.'
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication with access key and timestamp. Sign requests
    by creating a string from request method, URL path, MD5-hashed body, and UTC millisecond
    timestamp, then compute HMAC-SHA256 using a secret key. Include the access key,
    signature, and timestamp in request headers X-Nova-Access-Key, X-Nova-Signature,
    and X-Nova-Timestamp respectively. For sub-account operations, add X-Nova-Account-Id
    header with the sub-account ID value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://doc.novadax.com/en-US/:
  - The limit parameter (optional, string type) controls the number of orders returned
    per request. No explicit pagination fields like next, cursor, or page indicators
    are described in the response structure or headers.
  - Use query parameters size (optional, default 100) to control page size and start
    (optional) to specify the record ID for pagination. The response returns an array
    of records; use the ID of the last record as the start parameter in the next request
    to fetch subsequent pages.
