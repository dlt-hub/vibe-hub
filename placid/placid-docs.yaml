auth_info:
- information_source; https://placid.app/docs/2.0/sdk/authentication:
  - Placid API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for server-to-server authentication. JWTs
    are generated with your Placid API key and secret, signed using HS256 algorithm,
    and sent as a Bearer Token in the Authorization header. You can generate JWTs
    either via their API endpoint or self-sign them using HS256 with the required
    Header, Payload, and Signature structure.
- information_source; https://placid.app/docs/2.0/url/authentication:
  - Authentication is optional for the Placid URL API. To add security, use signed
    URLs with HMAC-SHA256 signatures appended as a query parameter. Hash your private
    API token and the query string using HMAC-SHA256, then append the result as `&s={SIGNATURE}`
    (must be the last parameter) to your image URL. Retrieve your project-specific
    private API token from placid.app/app/projects under API Tokens for each project.
  - Requests to Placid.app API require HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication. Create
    a signature by hashing the query string with your private API token using hash_hmac('sha256',
    $query_string, $api_token_private), then append it to the URL as the &s= parameter.
    The signature must be computed before adding the &s parameter itself to the query
    string.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://placid.app/docs/2.0/rest/collections:
  - The API uses optional per_page query parameter to control page size. Paginated
    responses include links.next and links.prev fields for navigation, along with
    meta.per_page indicating items per page. Use the URL in links.next to fetch subsequent
    pages until links.next is null.
