auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.provetcloud.com/restapi/:
  - The Provet Cloud REST API uses HTTP requests with authentication headers. The
    documentation references authentication via OAuth 2.0 as the authentication method,
    with data returned in JSON format. Specific OAuth 2.0 implementation details are
    available in the dedicated authentication documentation.
- information_source; https://developers.provetcloud.com/restapi/0.1/:
  - 'Required permissions: Reporting: Reports page and Reporting: Financial Bank payment
    processing reports. Rate limit is 300 requests per minute.'
  - 'Required permissions: Settings: Health plan settings. This endpoint is rate-limited
    to 300 requests per minute.'
  - 'Requires api_staff_token access token passed as a parameter for authentication.
    This endpoint is restricted to select provet accounts and requires Financial:
    Invoices permissions.'
  - 'Requires api_staff_token access token passed as a string parameter to authenticate
    requests. The "Backdate invoice" endpoint specifically requires this token for
    authenticating the request and is restricted to select providers with Financial:
    Invoices permissions.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.provetcloud.com/restapi/0.1/:
  - Multiple endpoints support pagination via query parameters. The page and page_size
    query parameters control pagination for listing endpoints (page is a page number,
    page_size is the number of results per page). Response structure for paginated
    results is not detailed in the documentation provided.
  - Page and page_size are query parameters for the List Cancellation Reasons endpoint.
    Page is a page number and page_size is the number of results per page, though
    exact defaults and maximum values are not specified in the documentation.
  - Pagination for the List Referrals endpoint uses query parameters page (page number)
    and page_size (number of results per page), both integers. The documentation does
    not specify response fields indicating pagination state, such as total count,
    has_more, or next page information.
  - Pagination is available for the List Items endpoint using query parameters page
    (page number) and page_size (number of results per page), both integers. Stop
    paginating when the response contains fewer results than the requested page_size
    or when no additional pages are available.
  - Pagination is controlled by query parameters page (page number) and page_size
    (number of results) in the request. The response structure for pagination fields
    is not documented in the provided text.
