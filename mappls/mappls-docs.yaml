notes:
- CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.
- Supports both manual interaction with the authorization server and convenience methods
  for token exchanges.
- Authorization servers that assume all clients are web-based, or require clients
  to maintain confidentiality of the client secrets may not work well.
- AppAuth supports PKCE if the server supports it.
- Custom URI schemes are supported on macOS.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- 'For any queries and support, please contact: apisupport@mappls.com'
