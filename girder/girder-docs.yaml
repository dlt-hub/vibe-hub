auth_info:
- information_source; https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-docs.html:
  - The documentation describes authentication token management methods in a Girder
    API REST resource class. Authentication uses tokens that can be passed in requests,
    managed via cookies, and validated against required scopes. The `getCurrentToken()`
    method retrieves the current token, `deleteAuthTokenCookie()` removes the auth
    cookie, and `ensureTokenScopes(scope)` validates that the token has the required
    scope or scopes (raising an AccessException if authorization fails).
- information_source; https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html:
  - OAuth2 authentication via Google. Client ID and client secret must be obtained
    from Google Cloud Console and entered in the plugin's configuration page. The
    OAuth callback URI is https://my.girder.com/api/v1/oauth/google/callback. Custom
    OAuth scopes can be added via Google.addScopes(). After successful OAuth authentication,
    the token is available in event.info['token'] for integration purposes.
- information_source; https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-client.html:
  - HTTP Basic Auth is used for all requests. Provide a username and password when
    constructing the GirderClient object, which will be automatically included in
    request headers.
- information_source; https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html:
  - Endpoints default to requiring administrator permissions. Access restrictions
    for administrator, user, or token-based access are enforced before endpoint code
    execution. CORS is disabled by default; enable it via Admin console Server configuration
    by setting CORS Allowed Origins (blank by default, set to * for any origin or
    comma-separated list of explicit origins), and optionally CORS Allowed Methods
    and CORS Allowed Headers fields.
