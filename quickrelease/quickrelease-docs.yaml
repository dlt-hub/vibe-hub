notes:
- It's easier to add all your cylinders first, then your balloon.
- Modifications made to a balloon’s details will only impact upcoming flights, not
  historical ones.
- Badges serve as visual indicators of the status of insurance and inspection dates.
- 'Green Badge: Both dates up to date.'
- 'Orange Badge: One date set to expire within one month.'
- 'Red Badge: One date expired or not provided.'
- The trial is currently limited to 30 selected customers to ensure quality and proper
  support
- Messages sent directly from your WhatsApp Business phone won’t sync back to QR -
  always use the QR interface for consistent communication
- Pilots and Crew members must have a valid email address and language preference
  set in their profile to receive notifications in their preferred language.
- The daily export in HTML format can be utilized for disaster preparedness.
- It’s recommended that customers establish procedures and infrastructure to handle
  offline operations.
- Each status is represented by a distinct icon to help you quickly identify the booking’s
  current state.
- API key is required to test all methods in the API playground.
