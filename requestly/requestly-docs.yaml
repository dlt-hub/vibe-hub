notes:
- Requestly is an open-source tool for API Mocking, Testing, and Debugging.
- You can simulate network delays for testing your application’s behavior under slow
  network conditions.
- The API is currently in BETA.
- API keys cannot access rules or data outside the associated workspace.
- Intercepting traffic to localhost or 127.0.0.1 requires specific configuration.
- This typically occurs due to SSL pinning, especially on Android devices.
- Requestly supports various authorization mechanisms, including API keys, OAuth 2.0,
  Bearer Tokens, and Basic Authentication.
- API Builder helps you design APIs, manage them using collections, and streamline
  workflows with variables.
- GraphQL requests work over HTTP just like REST, but instead of defining multiple
  endpoints, you typically interact with a single endpoint.
- Collection Runner enables you to execute multiple saved API requests from a collection
  in one go, sequentially, while leveraging existing variable and scripting features.
- Requestly allows you to send authorization data along with your API requests.
- Authorization data confirms that the sender has permission to access the API.
- Scripts in Requestly allow you to extend and customize your API requests and responses
  dynamically using JavaScript.
- Automated API testing ensures endpoints function as expected.
- History is stored locally in your browser’s local storage and is not synced to the
  cloud considering the security and privacy of your data.
- Only the last 20 requests are preserved in the history. Older entries are automatically
  removed as new requests are made.
- Requestly HTTP interceptor is a web proxy that runs on your computer.
- By routing network requests through Requestly, you can intercept all the network
  traffic made by the browser or your application.
- Create mock APIs locally without sending requests to the server.
- Supports bulk API mocking using recorded sessions.
- Requestly makes it easy to import and export File Server files as JSON.
- This feature is available only on Desktop App.
- Feature is supported in Browser Extensions only.
- HAR (HTTP Archive) files store detailed information about the network requests and
  responses.
- Local Workspace is currently in early beta and available only for the API Client
  on the desktop app.
- Some features may not work as expected.
- Multi-workspace view works only with local workspaces at this time.
- Requestly does not support the import of 'Modify Response Body' configurations from
  Header Editor.
- Global variables are not automatically exported using this method.
- Available on Extension Version >=24.7.23 and Desktop app version >=1.8.1
- Requestly simplifies every stage of API development.
- The API client in Requestly allows you to easily send API requests, without the
  need for writing code or using a terminal.
- This feature is perfect for developers testing API endpoints during development,
  QA engineers validating API responses for edge cases, and support engineers debugging
  API issues in real-time.
- Recording API sessions allows you to monitor and debug HTTP traffic between your
  application and the server.
- This feature is supported in Browser Extensions only.
- Sessions are temporarily stored in local storage, discarding older activity for
  efficiency.
- Uses HAR files to analyze network activity.
- Offers flexible access control for session recordings.
errors:
- Recording sessions capped at 5 minutes for optimal browser performance.
