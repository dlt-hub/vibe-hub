auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/integrations/indexers/covalent/:
  - API Key authentication is required. Obtain a free API key from GoldRush (begins
    with `cqt_` or `ckey_`), then pass it as basic auth credentials in the format
    `api_key:` (with empty password) using the `-u` flag in curl, or as the username
    in HTTP basic authentication headers.
  - 'API requests require a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Include
    the header ''Authorization: Bearer INSERT_API_KEY'' where INSERT_API_KEY is replaced
    with your actual API key.'
  - All requests require authentication using an API Key obtained from the GoldRush
    platform. The API Key must be provided to authenticate calls to the GoldRush API
    endpoints.
  - Authorization header using Bearer token. Include the API key in the Authorization
    header with the format "Bearer INSERT_API_KEY" when making requests to the API.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token scheme. Send the API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer INSERT_API_KEY" where INSERT_API_KEY is replaced with your actual
    API key obtained from Covalent.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/integrations/indexers/covalent/:
  - 'Pagination information is present in the response structure. The API uses offset-based
    pagination with the following parameters: has_more (boolean indicating if more
    results exist), page_number (current page, starting at 0), and page_size (number
    of results per page, default 100). To paginate, increment page_number in subsequent
    requests until has_more returns false.'
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with block bucket numbers in the URL path.
    The response includes a links object with prev and next fields containing full
    URLs to the previous and next pages. Pagination is complete when the complete
    field is true, and you continue by following the next URL until no further next
    link is provided.
  - The endpoint uses 0-indexed `page` parameter as a path parameter to request specific
    pages of transactions. The response indicates pagination is available but does
    not explicitly show next/previous fields or stopping conditions in the provided
    excerpt.
  - Use the `page` query parameter (0-indexed integer) to request specific pages.
    Response includes `links.prev` and `links.next` fields to navigate between pages;
    when either is null, that direction has no more pages.
