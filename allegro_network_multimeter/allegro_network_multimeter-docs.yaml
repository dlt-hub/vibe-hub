auth_info:
- information_source; https://allegro-packets.com/wiki/index.php?mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop&title=REST_API_description:
  - Basic authentication or API token authentication is required. For basic auth,
    send an Authorization header with value "Basic" followed by base64-encoded "USER:PASSWORD".
    Alternatively, use an Authorization header with value "Bearer API_TOKEN" when
    using an API token.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer API_TOKEN" where API_TOKEN is replaced with your actual API
    token. Additionally, basic authentication with USER:PASSWORD credentials can be
    used as an alternative, passed via the -u parameter in curl or as a standard HTTP
    Basic Auth header.
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: basic authentication using username
    and password via the curl -u parameter (USER:PASSWORD), or bearer token authentication
    via the Authorization HTTP header with the format "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN".
    The token approach is recommended for security as it keeps credentials out of
    process listings.'
  - The credentials are the same as for the web interface. Users with admin role have
    access to all APIs by default, while non-admin users have read access to most
    statistics. Starting with version 4.2, API tokens can be used instead of username/password,
    with configurable permissions set when creating the token. Access can be configured/restricted
    in role settings as of version 4.1.

  - Basic authentication or API token bearer authentication is required. For basic
    auth, send an Authorization header with value "Basic {base64(USER:PASSWORD)}".
    For API token auth, send an Authorization header with value "Bearer API_TOKEN".
    Both methods use the Authorization header in the HTTP request.
