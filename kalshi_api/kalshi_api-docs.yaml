notes:
- Tokens expire every 30 minutes, requires periodic re-login.
- API Key authentication is considered one of the easiest to use by developers but
  hard for API developers to get right.
- Environment variables are key-value pairs that are stored outside of source code.
- Values of environment variables can be applied to particular environments in order
  to change behavior or configuration.
- Only non-secret values can be read. Secrets are write-only, meaning the value can't
  be retrieved once it's set.
- Allow unauthenticated requests to proceed is false
- Frontend API URL is required
- OAuth resource metadata is disabled by default
- Allow unauthenticated requests is set to false by default.
- oAuthResourceMetadataEnabled is set to false by default.
- Requires setup of PropelAuth account.
- The payload of the Phantom JWT token will be on the request.user.data object accessible
  to the runtime.
- Authenticated requests will populate the 'user' property of the 'ZuploRequest' parameter
  on your RequestHandler.
- The secret to use for HMAC authentication must be stored as an environment variable.
- API key authentication is required to access the API.
- Use the environment variable MONGO_URI for MongoDB connection.
- API Tooling includes software and utilities for designing, testing, monitoring,
  and documenting APIs.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Buying an API management solution wins the build vs buy debate because the benefits
  outweigh building your own.
- API observability helps you understand how your APIs work, fix problems faster,
  and improve performance.
- It’s a step beyond monitoring, combining metrics, logs, and traces for a complete
  view of API behavior.
- Requires technical expertise for MuleSoft.
- Boomi offers a low-code solution for rapid deployment.
- This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
- API versioning should be a mandatory part of all requests.
- URL-based versioning is recommended for simplicity.
- We recommend requiring the client to indicate the version of the API they were designed
  for.
- Do not recommend just turning off the API permanently.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The API is serverless and built using NodeJS and Typescript.
- Requires proper database configuration and permissions management.
- API Analytics involves collecting and analyzing data about API performance, usage,
  and errors.
- API Monitoring provides insights into uptime, latency, error rates, and performance
  metrics.
- Zuplo seamlessly integrates Git workflows into API deployment and configuration
  processes.
- If issues arise, you can quickly revert to previous API configurations in seconds,
  minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth operation.
- API security should be outsourced to professionals.
- API Testing verifies that your API endpoints work as expected, ensuring reliability,
  security, and performance. It helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- Keep your APIs online with these reliable failover strategies and tools.
- Prevent API downtime with smart, code-based traffic surge alerts.
