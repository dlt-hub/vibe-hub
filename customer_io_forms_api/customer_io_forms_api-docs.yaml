auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.customer.io/integrations/data-in/connections/forms/forms-api/:
  - 'The Forms API requires authentication via an API key sent in the request headers.
    Include the header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` when making POST requests
    to `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/forms/{form_id}/submit`. The API key should
    be obtained from your Customer.io workspace settings. The request payload must
    include a `data` object containing an identifier field (email or id) that maps
    to the person submitting the form.'
- information_source; https://docs.customer.io/get-started/send-messages/:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer token required in the Authorization header. Pass the bearer
    token as "Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_BEARER_TOKEN" in the request headers when
    making API calls to Customer.io endpoints.'
- information_source; https://docs.customer.io/integrations/api/cdp/:
  - 'Basic Auth is required. Send credentials as an HTTP Authorization header using
    the format "Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)". The username is your
    Customer.io Site ID and the password is your API key.'
  - 'Our API uses basic authorization with an API Key as the username and a blank
    password. Base64 encode your credentials in the format API_key: and send them
    in the Authorization header using the HTTP basic scheme. For EU regions, use the
    cdp-eu subdomain instead of cdp in the endpoint URL.'
- information_source; https://docs.customer.io/integrations/api/track/:
  - Basic authentication is required for the Track API. Use your Site ID as the username
    and your secret key as the password. Include these credentials in the Authorization
    header using the standard HTTP Basic Auth format (base64-encoded "username:password").
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.customer.io/integrations/api/app/:
  - Pagination uses a "next" field in the response. Include the value of "next" as
    a query parameter in subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of newsletters.
    Stop paginating when "next" is not present in the response.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with a "next" field in the response containing
    a string value to fetch the next page of results. Include this "next" value in
    subsequent requests to retrieve additional pages.
  - 'Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme with query parameters: `start` (optional
    string token for the page, obtained from the `next` property in responses) and
    `limit` (optional integer, default 50, maximum 1000) to control page size. Responses
    contain a `next` property to retrieve subsequent pages.'
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, optional, max 100) to set results per
    page, sort (query parameter, optional, "asc" or "desc") to order results, and
    start (query parameter, optional) as a cursor token. The response contains a next
    property; use this value as the start parameter in the next request to retrieve
    subsequent pages.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: start (string token for page navigation,
    provided in response next property) and limit (integer for maximum results per
    page). Use the next value from responses to construct subsequent requests.'
