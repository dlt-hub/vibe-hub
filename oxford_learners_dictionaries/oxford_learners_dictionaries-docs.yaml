pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/api/v1/documentation/html:
  - Pagination uses query parameters pageindex (int, the index of result) and pagesize
    (int, the number of results). The documentation does not specify response fields
    for navigation, stopping conditions, or how to construct subsequent requests.
  - The search endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameters pagesize
    (number of results per page) and pageindex (zero-based page index). The response
    structure for indicating pagination state or navigation is not documented in the
    provided text.
