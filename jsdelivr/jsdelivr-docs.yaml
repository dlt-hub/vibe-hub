notes:
- Uses Multi-CDN infrastructure built on top of CDN networks provided by Cloudflare,
  Fastly, Bunny, and GCore.
- Our public CDN is built to be used in production by even the largest websites.
- Files are fetched directly from npm only the first time or when S3 goes down.
- Custom CDN endpoints available upon request
- Using jsDelivr CDN is free for both personal and commercial use
- There are no limits on bandwidth or number of requests
- Universal creative library is loaded with %%PATTERN:hb_format%%.js path.
- Some build tools make explicit use of Node features which have been introduced in
  version *8.9.0*.
- No default CSS file set by the package author so the URL is guessed.
- Slick works on IE8+ in addition to other modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox,
  and Safari.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- HLS.js is only compatible with browsers supporting MediaSource extensions (MSE)
  API with 'video/MP4' mime-type inputs.
- Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations and most have it
  on their own CDNs, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s).
- GSAP is now 100% FREE including ALL of the bonus plugins.
- We can work together and setup a custom configuration for your project.
- Custom CDN Endpoints can be set up for full control over files.
