auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bluecatnetworks.com/r/Address-Manager-RESTful-v2-API-Guide/Collections/9.5.0:
  - Basic authentication is required. Include an Authorization header with the value
    "Basic {basicAuthenticationCredentials}" where basicAuthenticationCredentials
    is a base64-encoded string of "username:password".
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    using the format "Authorization: Basic {basicAuthenticationCredentials}", where
    basicAuthenticationCredentials is a base64-encoded string of username:password.'
  - Basic authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    using the format "Basic {basicAuthenticationCredentials}", where basicAuthenticationCredentials
    is the base64-encoded username:password string.
  - Send API credentials using HTTP Basic Authentication in the Authorization header
    with the format "Basic {basicAuthenticationCredentials}". The header name is Authorization
    and the value should be "Basic" followed by base64-encoded username:password credentials.
  - The provided authorization token is invalid. This indicates the API uses token-based
    authorization sent in request headers. Clients must provide a valid authorization
    token; requests without proper credentials will receive a 401 Unauthorized response
    with error code InvalidAuthorizationToken.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bluecatnetworks.com/r/Address-Manager-RESTful-v2-API-Guide/Collections/9.5.0:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The offset parameter specifies
    the row number to start from (for example offset=10), and limit specifies the
    maximum number of results to return (for example limit=1000). The response includes
    a next object with an href containing the next request URL with updated offset
    and limit values.
  - The API uses limit and offset query parameters for pagination. The limit parameter
    (default 1000, maximum 100,000) specifies the number of resources per page, and
    offset specifies the starting row. The response includes a count field with the
    number of returned resources and prev/next links in the _links object to navigate
    pages when total resources exceed the limit.
  - Use query parameters `offset` and `limit` to control pagination. The response
    includes `count` field for returned resources, and `_links` object with `prev`
    and `href` containing next page URIs. Stop paginating when `_links` is omitted
    or no next link is present.
- information_source; https://docs.bluecatnetworks.com/r/Address-Manager-RESTful-v2-API-Guide/Introduction/9.5.0:
  - Use pagination query parameters `offset` and `limit` to control which resources
    are returned. The response includes `count` (number of resources returned), `data`
    (array of resources), and `_links` object with `prev` and `next` href URIs for
    navigating pages. Stop paginating when the number of resources returned is less
    than the `limit`.
- information_source; https://docs.bluecatnetworks.com/r/Address-Manager-RESTful-v2-API-Guide/Creating-an-API-session/9.5.0:
  - Use pagination query parameters offset and limit to control which and how many
    resources are returned. The response includes count field for number of resources,
    data array containing resources, and _links object with URI links to previous
    and next pages. Stop paginating when no offset is set and returned resources are
    less than the limit.
