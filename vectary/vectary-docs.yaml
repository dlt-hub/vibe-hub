notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Workspaces are independent entities, each with its own subscription and role settings.
- Workspace settings provide options for managing members, viewing invoices, and deleting
  workspaces.
- Billing section accessible only to workspace owner, includes subscription details.
- Search is available in both the Dashboard and Studio.
- Access Token is required for certain actions.
- User ID is needed for some operations.
- Roles are assigned within single workspaces.
- In cases where multiple Business workspaces exist, they operate independently.
- Vectary utilizes an internal measurement system that can be defined only when importing/exporting
  a file or configuring augmented reality settings.
- 'More detailed statistics are displayed in Preview mode: Performance analyzer'
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- A token needs to be generated only once in Figma and linked to Vectary to connect
  the Figma account.
- Vectary only supports geometry that can be directly converted to polygons, meaning
  we do not support curves or points.
- We recommend the size of the STEP/IGES file up to 50MB.
- 'Bulk file import is possible: to do this, drag and drop ZIP files onto the dashboard'
- Default values may result in distorted geometry. However, you can define the level
  of detail for each part of the object yourself. It is important to note that increasing
  the level of detail leads to an increase in the number of polygons, which results
  in a larger file size and can potentially affect the performance of the project.
- Each change in quality settings is based on the original file, so you can safely
  experiment with the settings.
- Optimized scenes are essential for achieving fast loading times and smooth performance
  in web environments across all platforms.
- Mesh density is a key factor in this process, as overly complex geometry can negatively
  impact performance.
- Vectary only supports geometry that can be directly converted to polygons.
- We do not support curves or points.
- Default values may result in distorted geometry.
- Access token is required to open Vectary Processor for the first time and can be
  retrieved from the Vectary Dashboard.
- Design mode is the primary mode in Studio, where the core project development happens.
- Scenes are assembled by creating or importing 3D assets, adjusting materials, and
  adding interactive elements.
- Projects in Vectary Processor are not saved automatically
- Optimized scenes are essential for achieving fast loading times and smooth performance
  in web environments across all platforms
- 'Supported formats for geometry import: FBX, GLTF, GLB, OBJ, STL'
- HDRI provides realistic lighting by capturing a wide range of luminance values.
- Materials can look dramatically different depending on the selected HDRI.
- HDRI environment influences materials and reflections.
- Intensity value can exceed 100 for stronger effects.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in vectary
- Some data may have limits on frequency of requests
- Some effects must be enabled manually for optimal performance.
- Requires setup of connected app in Vectary
- Libraries provide quick access to pre-configured assets and custom resources for
  more efficient project creation.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- This feature is currently in Beta as we actively refine the experience with variables
  and expressions.
- Enabled Augmented Reality will not conflict with WebXR.
- WebXR currently supports interactive elements, animations, floating UIs and hotspots.
- Limited support for iOS devices requires specialized WebXR-compatible browsers.
- WebXR integrates alongside existing AR experiences.
- Loading Screen feature enables customization of the project's loading interface.
- Allows changing every aspect of the loading screen, including the background, preloader,
  and defining whether the project loads automatically or upon button interaction.
- This feature allows customization of mouse movement sensitivity and behavior for
  rotation, panning, and dolly (zoom) actions in a shared project.
- These settings apply globally to the entire project.
- Specific limitations related to camera rotation, zoom, and panning can also be individually
  configured in each camera's settings.
- WebXR currently supports interactive elements, animations, and floating UIs and
  Hotspots on Android devices; unsupported on VR headsets.
- Limited iOS support requires specialized WebXR-compatible browsers such as XR Browser.
- Check the API rate limits to avoid throttling
- Requires connected app setup for OAuth2
- Projects are private by default and accessible only to you and your workspace members.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Vectary
- Some endpoints may have rate limits
- Fast loading is essential. Ideally, the scene should load within 2 to 3 seconds.
- Keep the embed size under 5MB, with a hard maximum of 10MB.
- Keep the embed size under 5MB, with a hard maximum of 10MB
- Cloning feature allows users to duplicate a project into their own workspace.
- No tokens are required. A Vectary project link is sufficient to begin.
- Comments can be added directly to any location in the scene
- Workspace members can be mentioned using `@` followed by their name
- Mentioned users receive an email notification if email alerts are enabled in their
  account settings
- Background color is affected by the Adjustment effect.
- Custom events need to be setup directly in studio.
- Improved interactions optimization for performance.
- Improved resolution and performance in WebXR.
- Ensure the API key is kept secret.
- Some endpoints may have usage limits.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in API
- Adjusted USDZ import to retain correct scale.
- Improved support for skeletal animation in AR on iOS
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Vectary.
