auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/rest-api-developers-guide/overview/using-logicmonitors-rest-api:
  - LogicMonitor REST API requires authentication using either LMv1Auth or a Bearer
    token. LMv1Auth is a custom authentication scheme; Bearer token authentication
    uses the standard Authorization header with a Bearer token. Both methods must
    be used before making API calls with the Python or GO SDKs.
  - 'LogicMonitor REST API supports three authentication methods: Bearer token, LMv1,
    and Basic authentication (v1 only). All requests must use HTTPS. For detailed
    implementation including header names, parameter formats, and token acquisition,
    refer to the REST API Authentication documentation.'
- information_source; https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/adding-an-api-token:
  - 'LogicMonitor''s REST API supports two token-based authentication methods: LMv1
    tokens (key-based authentication using access-id and access-key pair) and Bearer
    tokens. LMv1 tokens consist of an access-id and access-key that are automatically
    generated per user and used to authenticate API calls to the LogicMonitor platform.'
- information_source; https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/adding-a-bearer-token:
  - Bearer token authentication is used for LogicMonitor REST API calls. The token
    is generated per user in the LogicMonitor UI (Settings > User Access > Users and
    Roles > Bearer Token tab) and must be sent as a bearer token in the Authorization
    header for API requests. The token is fully visible only at generation time, is
    unique and non-transferable per user, and requires the "Allow Creation of API
    Tokens" permission to generate. Users with DataIngestion permission can have tokens
    created for them.
  - Bearer token authentication is used to authenticate API requests. The bearer token
    must be enabled (enabled by default after generation) to authenticate requests;
    disabled tokens will cause all existing API requests to fail. For the Python v3
    SDK, you authenticate by setting the bearer token in the SDK configuration, similar
    to the GO SDK method SetBearerToken(), where you provide your bearer token value
    to the config object.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.logicmonitor.com/support-files/rest-api-developers-guide/sdks/docs/:
  - Offset-based pagination with optional size parameter. Use offset query parameter
    to specify starting position (default 0) and size to control results per page.
    Response includes items array and total count to determine remaining pages.
  - 'Offset-based pagination. Query parameters: size (optional, page size), offset
    (optional, starting position). Use offset and size to navigate pages; increment
    offset by size for next page.'
  - Pagination for the getReportGroupList endpoint uses offset and size query parameters.
    The size parameter controls the number of results per page, and offset specifies
    the starting position. The response includes a data array with report groups and
    a total count field to indicate the total number of available results.
  - Pagination is controlled by size (page size, optional integer) and offset (starting
    position, optional integer) query parameters. The response structure for pagination
    fields is not shown in this documentation excerpt.
  - 'Pagination is supported via optional query parameters: size (page size), offset
    (starting position), and filter (optional filtering). The response structure is
    not shown in the provided documentation chunk, so the specific pagination response
    fields cannot be determined from this excerpt.'
