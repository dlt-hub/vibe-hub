auth_info:
- information_source; https://help.akana.com/content/current/cm/api/:
  - The documentation references authentication and session management. Authentication
    with the Akana API Platform API uses a session cookie-based approach. You must
    log in using credentials, manage the session cookie for subsequent requests, and
    explicitly log out by invoking POST /api/login/logout when finished. Refer to
    the "Authentication and Security with the Akana API Platform API" documentation
    for detailed information on the login process and session cookie management.
  - Use the POST /api/login endpoint to obtain an authentication token, which must
    then be included in subsequent API requests. The token is valid for 30 minutes
    and must be renewed periodically. Authentication is required for some operations
    but not all; check individual operation documentation to determine if authentication
    is needed. Tokens are typically passed via cookies, which the client platform
    must support.
- information_source; https://help.akana.com/content/current/cm/api/Ref_AuthenticationAndSecurity.htm:
  - 'Authentication uses cookie-based sessions. After login, the server returns a
    cookie via Set-Cookie response header that must be included in subsequent requests.
    When the Atmo-Renew-Token: renew response header is present, the client must use
    the updated cookie from the new Set-Cookie header in further operations. Cookies
    can be manually renewed using POST /api/login/renewToken, and sessions are ended
    with GET /api/login/endsession.'
  - CSRF protection is implemented using X-Csrf-Token_{fedmemberID} response headers
    that must be extracted and sent back in subsequent requests. Session cookies are
    maintained via Set-Cookie response headers and can be renewed using POST /api/login/renewToken
    endpoint when user information changes during the session.
  - Session-based authentication using a cookie named AtmoAuthToken. After calling
    POST /api/login, include the returned session cookie in subsequent request headers.
    Most operations require this session cookie; specific permission requirements
    depend on user roles (app team member, Business Admin, Site Admin, API Admin,
    etc.) as documented per operation.
