auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.thesportsdb.com/docs_api_examples:
  - API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the X-API-KEY header with
    each request. The api_key value should be obtained from the service and included
    as a string in the header.
  - The API uses API key authentication via the X-API-KEY header. Include your API
    key in the X-API-KEY request header when making calls to the API endpoints.
- information_source; https://www.thesportsdb.com/docs_api_testing:
  - V1 API uses an API key passed as a query parameter (e.g., `?123/searchteams.php`).
    V2 API requires the API key sent in the `X-API-KEY` header with your private API
    key as the value.
- information_source; https://www.thesportsdb.com/documentation:
  - 'The API key (value "123" in the examples) is passed as a path segment in the
    URL immediately after "/json/" in all requests. Include your API key directly
    in the URL path before the endpoint name, for example: https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/{your_api_key}/searchteams.php'
  - The API uses a numeric API key for authentication. For v1 API, pass the key as
    a URL query parameter. For v2 API, send the key in the request header (exact header
    name not specified in documentation). The free API key is 123, and premium keys
    are available on user profiles for supporters. Premium keys unlock additional
    methods, higher limits, and access to v2 API.
