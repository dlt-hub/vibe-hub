- This category is for ecosystem developers to ask questions regarding Atlassian Design
  System, Atlaskit, and AUI.
- Ask questions related to Atlassian provided developer tools and libraries.
- This category is intended for any posts that don’t fit into another, more specific
  category.
- This category is for discussing the impact of Data Residency on the ecosystem.
- This category is for developers who are interested in discussing server to cloud
  migrations of their apps.
- This category contains active Early Access Programs that Atlassian is running for
  cloud platforms with the ecosystem.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- It’s very frustrating it’s not documented what URLs are allowed on various Atlassian
  products and services and how to deal with custom URL schemes.
- 'After changes [CHANGE-2717] and [CHANGE-2794] it’s possible: To use link directly
  when client egress is allowed to all *, To use bridge.router.navigate or bridge.router.open
  when client egress is configured to myscheme:*.'
- There is no dedicated REST endpoint that directly returns 'users who can be reporters'
  for a given project.
- Reporters are usually customers, not licensed Jira users.
- Having a credit system by Atlassian to compensate is really important to vendors.
- Some field types are rejected as 'unknown question types'.
- Properties won’t be indexed unless added to the manifest
- After the upgrade, the application links is broken.
- 'Macros which utilise this invocation are failing with the error: ''Cannot invoke
  method getPrimaryApplicationLink() on null object''.'
- The payload size of the function cannot be more than 200 KB.
- Consumers will have a maximum timeout of 55 seconds.
- The floating table of contents will help users navigate live docs & pages.
- Delta migrations allow for smaller migrations with reduced downtime.
- Currently this feature is only available in Jira but we are working on introducing
  this feature to Confluence.
- Plan to remove all v1 APIs currently marked as deprecated from service on December,
  2nd 2024.
- v1 pagination requires handling of next links to avoid 404 errors.
- All Confluence v1 APIs currently marked as deprecated will be removed from service
  on March 31, 2025.
- Seems like the returned insertId worked with only AUTO_INCREMENT and not with AUTO_RANDOM
- 'Avoid using AUTO_INCREMENT fields in your tables, as this could cause hotspot issues
  when used on databases with very large datasets. We recommend either of the following
  strategies instead: Use AUTO_RANDOM to handle auto-increment primary key hotspot
  tables or Store UUIDs as BINARY(16) type.'
- As of recently, Forge SQL queries that previously returned numeric values for aggregation
  functions are now returning string representations of numbers.
- The rollout of this feature has been paused. Apps should see numbers for all INT
  types as numbers, without any String conversion.
- Atlassian has banned such links in the work item description field.
- 'For Software / Business projects: Use the Group & User Picker endpoint with a projectId.'
- You can declare a total of 30 entityProperties in the manifest
- Custom JQL functions rely on precomputed data that the Forge function provides,
  which Jira then uses to evaluate the query.
- Precomputations are stored on a per-user basis, or are they instance-wide.
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Delta migrations allow for smaller migrations with reduced migration downtime.
- Delta migrations minimise customer downtime and operational pressure.
- Marketplace partners must implement the new listener methods to support delta migrations.
- Receiving every single Issue update event from a Jira Cloud instance has never been
  a good idea and is something that is frequently advised against doing due to the
  volume of events that can be sent.
- Migration to v2 APIs is necessary before December, 2nd 2024
- v1 pagination requires multiple calls now in v2
- Next links in v2 API require a fix to avoid 404 errors
- Deprecation period for all Confluence v1 APIs extended until March 31, 2025.
- Currently updating to @atlaskit/link-datasource version > 4.22.0 is blocked for
  us due to this license issue.
- There are no allowed values for the Goals field.
- enableDownloadButton has no visual or functional effect — the toolbar does not show
  a download button.
- alignLeftOnInsert is ignored, and images continue to default to center or full width.
- fullWidthEnabled is ineffective — uploaded images continue to occupy the full width
  of the editor container.
- 'Update your CSP to include: style-src https://ds-cdn.prod-east.frontend.public.atl-paas.net
  font-src https://ds-cdn.prod-east.frontend.public.atl-paas.net'
- Some older releases the zipURL has changed from https to http.
- Use multipart/form-data for file uploads
- Change the value of name property to customize tab title.
- Comment type in Confluence GraphQL API needs parentCommentId field
- adding the <meta> tags has no affect as the content-security-policy is being set
  by the iframe html response request headers
- There is no way to forcibly convert free users into paid ones; they will have to
  manually update to the paid version of your app.
- Forge will become a paid platform in January
- CORS issue may prevent reading rate limit headers from response
- A hello world custom field.
- A editable custom field.
- A Read Only custom field.
- A time since created custom field.
- Forge cli is not taking the environment variable FORGE_EMAIL and FORGE_AUTH_TOKEN
  while executing forge install commend
- Iframe has 150px in initial render and then resized to 50px, causing movement.
- Add the right permissions to your manifest
- When the app loads, the iframe height starts at less than half of the screen height.
- Setting specific pixel values for height prevents infinite growth but doesn’t achieve
  the desired responsive design.
- Custom UI is intended to be hosted by Forge and not designed for iframes hosted
  externally.
- To allow external frames, permissions need to be set in the configuration.
- Multiple reports from Marketplace Partners that their apps are experiencing errors
  when loaded in the host Atlassian product.
- The loading problem disappears after a short period of time (e.g. 45 mins) and the
  app starts working again.
- Browser behaviour may be involved in the problem (e.g. corporate firewalls, browser
  type/version, caching, etc.).
- The main problem is that loading add-on iframe times out and add-on code is not
  executed at all.
- When it happens, all apps/iframes are affected.
- 'Try disabling the clipboard API. eg I use this package in one of my apps and the
  copy function still works on latest Chrome: use-clipboard-hook - npm'
- 'Adding the parameters copiedDuration: 3000, disableClipboardAPI: true made it work!'
- Chrome version 92 blocks cross-origin alerts, confirms, and prompts
- Assuming you’re using UI Kit, use a Box. You can set the size with xcss.
- Please include modified-date field in the response body for v.2 AND allow time based
  filters on endpoints
- Users can choose a cover/title image for blog posts.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Atlassian
- Some components may have rendering issues in certain environments
- Pasting HTML content containing img tag with query param src is not submittable.
- I resolve this problem by use the rest api.
- I save the image in JIRA_HOME. And read image, send it via rest(url)
- You should reference your image relative to the root of the site you’re running.
- It looks like you are making that call from the front-end, if that is the case maybe
  you should use client instead of backend in the manifest.
- On 28 Feb 2025, the Forge sandbox runtime and Forge UI Kit 1 will be deprecated.
- Apps must migrate from the Sandbox runtime to the new Node.js runtime.
- Apps using UI Kit 1 must migrate to the latest version of UI Kit.
- Existing apps in the old runtime will run until 28th March 2025.
- Apps using UI Kit 1 will stop working on February 28th.
- Resolvers should be usable now, can you confirm that issue is resolved
- Forge timeout issue after 25 seconds - API takes approx 30 seconds to complete.
- 'To avoid nesting modals, use actionType: dynamic with Custom UI.'
- Use Forge Bridge Modal API to render Atlaskit modal directly.
- JWT token generation is required for authentication.
- Uses inline styles which may be blocked by CSP
- Some API endpoints may require specific permissions.
- Bamboo Data Center supports API integration
- Initial attempts to create the issue picker using the API resulted in a CSP error.
- Adding *.atlassian.net as an external source resolved the CSP issue.
- The link used in the application itself has to be relative
- 'The Apps label is rendered after the private API request: /rest/servicedesk/1/customer/servicedesk-data/forge/fetch-extensions.'
- To hide the app title, set a non-standard whitespace character as the title of the
  module in the manifest.
- unsafe-inline permissions helped.
- Docs have tons of deprecated stuff.
- With Custom UI, you’re responsible for the styling yourself and can use any framework
  you like.
- CSP on the forge iframe prevents images to be loaded from '<instance>.atlassian.net'
  and 'api.media.atlassian.com'.
- Better support for attachments is something we are looking at but are unable to
  give an exact timeframe for yet.
- It will be possible to fetch images from a remote server as part of our upcoming
  CSP work.
- Web triggers currently have a lower payload limit than invoke due to a limitation.
- Accessing forge api route gives error on Content Security Policy
- Custom UI apps now allow-list the host product
- Atlassian-hosted avatars now load by default
- App failing to run when the run time is nodejs20.x
- After changing the run time to nodejs18.x I stopped getting the error in staging.
