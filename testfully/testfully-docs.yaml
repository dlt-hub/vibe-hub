auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.testfully.io/docs/authorization/:
  - Basic authentication requires sending an Authorization header with the value "Basic
    " followed by a Base64-encoded string of "username:password". Username and password
    are entered in the Authorization tab, with the header name typically set to "Authorization"
    and prefix to "Basic".
  - The API supports multiple authentication methods. Basic authentication uses an
    Authorization header with Base64 encoded username and password prefixed with "Basic".
    Bearer token authentication sends an API key in the Authorization header prefixed
    with "Bearer". API key authentication sends a key-value pair either in request
    headers or query string parameters with a configurable field name. OAuth 2.0 authentication
    requires configuring a provider, grant type, token refresh policy, authorization
    and access token URLs, client ID, client secret, scope, and audience.
