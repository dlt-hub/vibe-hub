    AWS Signature Version 4 authentication. Credentials are sent via the Authorization
    header for requests to AWS services like S3.

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.lacework.net/api/v2/docs:
  - '"paging" object contains rows (number of results returned, max 5000), totalRows
    (total count), and urls (containing next page URL). Use the next URL from urls
    to fetch subsequent pages; stop when urls is empty or no next URL is provided.'
  - 'Pagination uses a `paging` field in the response containing `rows` (number of
    results returned), `totalRows` (total available results), and `urls` with a `nextPage`
    field providing the complete Next Page URL. To fetch the next page, send a GET
    request to the entire `nextPage` URL with required headers "Authorization: Bearer
    {YourAPIToken}" and "Content-Type: application/json". Next Page URLs remain valid
    for 24 hours.'
  - Pagination uses a `paging` field in the response containing `rows`, `totalRows`,
    and `url` fields. The documentation does not specify request parameters for pagination
    control (such as page, limit, or offset parameters), so the exact mechanism for
    navigating pages is unclear from this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses a `paging` field in the response containing `rows`, `totalRows`,
    and `urls`. The `urls.nextPage` field provides the complete Next Page URL, valid
    for 24 hours. To retrieve the next page, send a GET request to the entire Next
    Page URL with Authorization and Content-Type headers. Pagination is unavailable
    if the `paging` field is absent from the response.
  - 'Pagination uses a `paging` object in the response containing `rows` (current
    page size), `totalRows` (total count), and `urls.nextPage` (complete URL for next
    page). To paginate, send a GET request to the `nextPage` URL with required headers
    "Authorization: Bearer {YourAPIToken}" and "Content-Type: application/json". Next
    Page URLs expire after 24 hours. Stop paginating when `nextPage` is not returned.'
