  - 'Pocket API uses OAuth2 authentication. First, register an application at getpocket.com/developer/apps/new.php
    to obtain a Consumer Key. Then POST to https://getpocket.com/v3/oauth/request
    with headers Host: getpocket.com, Content-Type: application/json, X-Accept: application/json,
    and JSON body containing consumer_key and redirect_uri fields to receive an access
    token for subsequent API requests.'
  - The OpenWeatherMap API requires an API Key for authentication. Pass the API key
    as a query parameter named appid in the GET request URL, for example appid=YOUR_API_KEY.
    The key is obtained by creating a free account at openweathermap.org and copying
    it from the API Keys tab in the portal, though it may take up to 10 minutes after
    account creation to become active.
