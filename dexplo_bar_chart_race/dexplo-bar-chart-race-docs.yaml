notes:
- It is possible for some bars to be out of order momentarily during a transition
  since both height and location change linearly and not directly with respect to
  their current value.
- Dexplot is a Python library for delivering beautiful data visualizations with a
  simple and intuitive user experience.
- By default, conversion to pdf happens via LaTeX, which you must have pre-installed
  on your machine.
- Conversion via Chrome browser is much quicker and will look very different than
  the LaTeX rendition.
- Currently, this package only works for the 'classic' Jupyter Notebook and is not
  available in Jupyter Lab.
