notes:
- Sphinx AutoAPI generates documentation from Python code.
- Install the `sphinx-autoapi` package using pip.
- Add AutoAPI it to the Sphinx extension list.
- List your package directories in `autoapi_dirs`.
- Sphinx AutoAPI include all subpackages and submodules recursively, unless those
  are marked as private by prefixing their name with an underscore.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Python 3.11 support added, dropped support for Python 3.8
- 'Known issue: Refresh issue arises on macOS when the viewer window is resized by
  a window manager'
- ZeroConf setup with the RPi means no need to mess with explicit IP addresses.
- Uses doit to automate SVG optimization
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- This article targets an audience of FOSS maintainers who are unhappy with the state
  of their project’s API documentation, and are frustrated with the process of improving
  it.
- Sphinx AutoAPI includes all subpackages and submodules recursively, unless those
  are marked as private by prefixing their name with an underscore.
- Updated the documentation template (#428)
- Updated installation instructions to use pipx (#428)
- The read command records the source SVG paths in the vp_source and vp_sources system
  properties.
- The read command is currently the only command which sets the vp_source and vp_sources
  variables.
- This is the last version of vpype to support Python 3.7.
- The site is built using Hugo and GitHub Pages.
- Python 3.11 support introduced
- 'Known issue: refresh issue arises on macOS when the viewer window is resized by
  a window manager'
- Migrated to PySide6 (from PySide2), which simplifies installation on Apple silicon
  Macs
- Using layout tight would formerly set the page size to 0 by 0, which is useless
  in itself and caused a blank display.
- Added inch unit as a synonym to in, useful for expressions.
- No such 'contains' test exists by default in Jinja2. It's trivial to add one.
- The read command now records the source SVG paths in the vp_source and vp_sources
  system properties.
- The article covers both hardware and software aspects of the project.
- The setup involves two Raspberry Pis for convenience.
- vsketch doesn’t zero-pad the frame number in the SVGs it produces
- This can trigger a complete rebuild whenever the sketch file is modified
- Uses doit for batch processing SVGs
- Tasks can be skipped if dependencies are up-to-date
- The file may also have a different name, or be located elsewhere, but then its path
  should be provided to doit.
- Using dodo.py is simpler because this file is automatically detected and loaded
  by doit.
- Introduced metadata to the pipeline in the form of properties which may either be
  attached to specific layers or all of them.
- The read and write commands now preserve a sub-set of SVG attributes.
- This release further solidifies the block commands which were overhauled in vpype
  1.9.
- Improved the linemerge algorithm by making it less dependent on line order.
