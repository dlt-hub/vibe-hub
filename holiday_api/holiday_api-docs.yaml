  - API key authentication is required and must be provided with each request. The
    API returns a 401 status code if the API key is missing. Rate limits are enforced
    monthly and vary by plan, with usage tracked via the requests property in the
    response body.
  - API key authentication is required, passed as a query parameter named "key" in
    requests to the Holiday API endpoints.
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key as the `key` parameter in
    the request URL query string or in the request body as a `key` field. The API
    key is a required string parameter that identifies your account and enables rate
    limiting tracking per API key.
  - Holiday API uses API key authentication passed as a query parameter. Include the
    key parameter in your request URL with your API key value, for example key=__YOUR_API_KEY__.
  - The API requires an API key passed as a query parameter named "key" in GET requests
    to authenticate. Include your API key in the URL as ?key=__YOUR_API_KEY__.
