pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bookla.com/rest-api-docs/:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter controls
    the number of results returned, and offset specifies the starting position in
    the result set. The response contains a clients array with the paginated results.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The response includes limit,
    offset, and total fields. Use offset to navigate pages by incrementing it by the
    limit value; stop when offset plus returned items reaches total.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit parameters in the request body. offset specifies
    the starting position (integer), and limit specifies the maximum number of results
    to return (integer). Continue paginating by incrementing offset by the limit value
    until fewer results than limit are returned.
  - The API supports offset-based pagination with limit and offset query parameters.
    The limit parameter controls the number of results returned per request, and the
    offset parameter specifies where to start in the result set. The response includes
    a bookings array; construct subsequent requests by incrementing the offset value
    by the limit amount until fewer results than the limit are returned.
  - The response includes offset-based pagination with limit, offset, and total fields.
    Use limit and offset as query parameters to control page size and starting position;
    stop when offset + returned items equals total.
