pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.jivesoftware.com/api/v3/6.0/rest/:
  - '**count** and **startIndex** are query parameters for pagination. **count** specifies
    how many results to return per request, and **startIndex** specifies the starting
    position for results. Use **startIndex** values incrementally with **count** to
    retrieve subsequent pages until all results are obtained.'
  - Use the `startIndex` query parameter to paginate through results, incrementing
    it by the `count` value for each subsequent request. The response includes a `links.next`
    field containing the URL for the next page; stop paginating when `links.next`
    is absent.
  - Use the count query parameter to specify items per page. The response includes
    startIndex (current position), itemsPerPage (page size), and a links.next field
    containing the URL for the next page. Continue paginating until no next link is
    present.
- information_source; https://developers.jivesoftware.com/api/v3/cloud/rest/ContentService.html:
  - Pagination uses startIndex (zero-relative index, optional) and count (maximum
    number of results, optional) query parameters. The response returns an array of
    items; use startIndex and count to control which page of results to retrieve.
  - Pagination uses startIndex (zero-relative index, optional, query parameter) and
    count (maximum number of results, optional, query parameter) for offset-based
    pagination on the Get Outcome Types endpoint.
