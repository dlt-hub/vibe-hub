In this guide, we'll set up a complete Shopline data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector, like in the partial example code below:

```python-outcome
@dlt.source
def shopline_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://open.shopline.io/v1/products/:product_id/variations/:id",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            }
        },
        "resources": [
            "update_price`", "update_quantity`"
        ],
    }
    [...]
    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    # Connect to destination
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='shopline_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='shopline_data', 
    )
    # Load the data
    load_info = pipeline.run(shopline_source())
    print(load_info) 
```

### Why use dltHub Workspace with LLM Context to generate Python pipelines?

- Accelerate pipeline development with AI-native context
- Debug pipelines, validate schemas and data with the integrated **Pipeline Dashboard**
- Build Python notebooks for end users of your data
- **Low maintenance** thanks to Schema evolution with type inference, resilience and self documenting REST API connectors. A shallow learning curve makes the pipeline easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses, bringing mature data loading to pythonic Iceberg with or without catalogs

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from shopline‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- **Products Management**: Endpoints for updating product quantities, searching for products, and retrieving product details.
  - `/v1/products/:product_id/update_quantity`: Update the quantity of a specific product.
  - `/v1/products`: List products with pagination options.
  - `/v1/products/search`: Search for products using various criteria.

- **Addon Products**: Manage additional products that can complement main products.
  - `/v1/addon_products`: Retrieve a list of addon products.
  - `/v1/addon_products/:id/update_quantity`: Update the quantity of a specific addon product.

- **Orders Management**: Endpoints for handling orders, including searching, updating status, and retrieving order information.
  - `/v1/orders`: Retrieve a list of all orders.
  - `/v1/orders/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific order.
  - `/v1/orders/search`: Search for orders based on various parameters.

- **Gifts Management**: Manage gifts in the system.
  - `/v1/gifts/:id/update_quantity`: Update the quantity of a specific gift.

- **Token Information**: Retrieve information about the current token being used.
  - `/v1/token/info`: Get details about the authentication token.

- **Order Labels**: Manage the labeling of orders for tracking or processing.
  - `/v1/orders/label`: Create or retrieve labels for orders.

You will then debug the Shopline pipeline using our Pipeline Dashboard tool to ensure it is copying the data correctly, before building a Notebook to explore your data and build reports.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - We suggest using a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started!

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Set up `dlt` Workspace**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install "dlt[workspace]"
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with Shopline support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:shopline duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup the necessary files and folders for the next step.
    
2. ü§† **Start LLM-assisted coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a prompt to get you started:
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for Shopline API, as specified in @shopline-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints update_price` and update_quantity` and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in shopline_pipeline.py and name the pipeline shopline_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python shopline_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Set up credentials** 
    
    To access the Shopline OpenAPI, you must include the `User-Agent` header with a value such as "Shopline", which should be replaced with your company's handle; additionally, you need to provide the `:access_token` in the authorization header formatted as `Bearer :access_token`.
    
    To get the appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://open-api.docs.shoplineapp.com/docs/openapi-request-example.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python shopline_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly, you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline shopline load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset shopline_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/shopline.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **Debug your pipeline and data with the Pipeline Dashboard**

    Now that you have a running pipeline, you need to make sure it‚Äôs correct, so you do not introduce silent failures like misconfigured pagination or incremental loading errors. By launching the dlt Workspace Pipeline Dashboard, you can see various information about the pipeline to enable you to test it. Here you can see:
    - Pipeline overview: State, load metrics
    - Data‚Äôs schema: tables, columns, types, hints
    - You can query the data itself
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline shopline_pipeline show dashboard
    ```
    
6. üêç **Build a Notebook with data explorations and reports**

    With the pipeline and data partially validated, you can continue with custom data explorations and reports. To get started, paste the snippet below into a new marimo Notebook and ask your LLM to go from there. Jupyter Notebooks and regular Python scripts are supported as well.

    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("shopline_pipeline").dataset()
   # get "update_price`" table as Pandas frame
   data."update_price`".df().head()
    ```
