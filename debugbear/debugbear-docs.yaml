notes:
- Use the x-api-key for authentication in headers.
- DebugBear provides unique features that are crucial to debugging complex issues,
  like request-chain visualization.
- Track site speed in the browser with zero-config alerts
- Supports CI/CD integration and API access for testing
- DebugBear continuously runs high-quality site speed tests and alerts you when there's
  a problem.
- No credit card required for trial
- Maximize organic traffic by optimizing Google's Core Web Vitals.
- Get more conversions by providing a good experience to visitors.
- Requires setup of connected app in DebugBear
- Tracks Core Web Vitals data.
- Supports real-user monitoring.
- CrUX data is delayed by 28 days
- DebugBear is a page speed monitoring service built for Core Web Vitals.
- Uses real user monitoring data for accurate performance insights.
- Google collects metrics from real users on your website as part of the Chrome User
  Experience Report (CrUX).
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in DebugBear
- No credit card required.
- For designers and web developers.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- DebugBear does not act as a data processor for Lab Data.
- Web performance requires specialized skills, so it's a good idea to bring in an
  external consultant to make sure your team can work on the most impactful changes.
- DebugBear runs website tests in a controlled lab environment built on top of Google's
  Lighthouse tool.
- Lab data collected with Lighthouse-based tools usually shows slower speeds than
  field data from real users.
- Lighthouse tests on PageSpeed Insights or in Chrome DevTools load pages on a fast
  connection and then simulate how they would have loaded with a slower network.
- DebugBear throttles the network at the operating-system level and then runs the
  Lighthouse test, resulting in increased accuracy.
- Four devices are configured by default.
- DebugBear offers in-depth performance testing with a detailed request waterfall.
- DebugBear tracks the size of your JavaScript or CSS bundles.
- DebugBear will alert you if the size of your bundles change.
- Uses OAuth2 authentication.
- DebugBear can alert you to regressions by sending notifications over email, in Slack,
  or in Microsoft Teams.
- Real user metrics available from Chrome User Experience Report
- Lab-based tests can provide extra debug information
- LCP is one of the three Core Web Vitals metrics that impact search result rankings.
- For optimal user experience, aim for an LCP of 2.5 seconds or less.
- Different versions of Chrome measure LCP slightly differently.
- The LCP metric changes as more content on the page is painted.
- DebugBear allows you to monitor your performance over time, understand the role
  of different resources on the page, and get insights into how to load them more
  quickly.
- Prefetched resources will use up data on the visitor's device, so you should avoid
  prefetching an excessive amount of resources.
- Chrome sometimes prefetches resources too early, which means they compete with the
  actual content on your website and make it load more slowly.
- Lazily loading the LCP image on your website can cause poor page performance and
  user experience.
- Cache content for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- For caching to be effective, configure validators like ETags or Last-Modified headers
- If you set your sampling rate to be lower than 5% then your embed code will change.
- You may get a message saying that you need to update the embed code on your website
  for the change to take effect.
- You can still make small changes to your sampling rate without needing to update
  the embed code.
- Only the first 1000 requests or user timing entries are considered for auto collection.
  This should not impact the majority of users.
- You can configure DebugBear Real user monitoring (RUM) directly from the DebugBear
  dashboard.
- Avoid downloading the script and hosting the file on your server.
- Editing the proxy configuration changes the code of your RUM script.
- Make sure that the element matching the CSS selector is present when the DebugBear
  RUM snippet loads. If it only appears later then the page group won't be assigned.
- Google uses Core Web Vitals as a meaningful ranking signal.
- API keys can have full access or read-only access. Read-only API keys cannot trigger
  tests or create projects, pages, or annotations.
- 'Results are reported to GitHub if the following arguments are passed into the CLI:
  --repoOwner, --repoName, --commitHash, --baseBranch, --baseHash'
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is one of the three Core Web Vitals metrics that impact
  search result rankings in Google.
- A Cumulative Layout Shift score below 0.1 is considered good for user experience.
- Interaction to Next Paint became one of the Core Web Vitals metrics in March 2024.
- INP is a Core Web Vitals metric that affects your Google search rankings.
- The script runs as soon as the page starts loading, so use logic like `await waitForElement("body")`
  if you want to interact with page content.
- In your page settings, click on Show advanced.
- Then expand the Warm Load section and enable Disable clearing cache.
- The steps described here only work for user interactions in a single-page app.
- Data won't be collected if a redirect occurs after the initial page load.
- Only a small amount of performance data is collected for user flows that run before
  the primary page test.
- Cookie banners only appear during a visitor's first page view on your website.
- Testing your page speed without cookie consent popups is more representative of
  a typical user experience.
- Enabling fixed IPs reduces the number of servers that can run your tests, and it
  may take longer for tests to finish.
- RUM tools can load analytics code asynchronously to ensure they don’t slow down
  the page load speed.
- Data collection should also happen asynchronously where possible.
- Requires API key for authentication.
- You'll need an Admin API key to create and manage projects and pages.
- For security, API keys or tokens should not be hard-coded in the config.yml.
- Alerts are sent once a performance budget has been breached or there has been a
  significant change.
- Set the variable key to DEBUGBEAR_API_KEY and enter the API key obtained from the
  Project API tab on the DebugBear website.
- Set up the DEBUGBEAR_API_KEY environment variable
- Real user monitoring can help identify slow interactions.
- Poor INP scores can vary based on user device performance.
- TTI is not one of the Core Web Vitals metrics that directly impact SEO.
- Total Blocking Time is a web performance metric that Google uses to assess the page
  speed impact of CPU processing tasks.
- Ideally, TBT should be under 300 milliseconds on mobile and under 100 milliseconds
  on desktop.
- 'If `buffered: true` isn''t working for you, try using a newer version of Chrome.'
- Lighthouse score is frequently unreliable
- Different score thresholds on mobile vs desktop
errors:
- 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Reduce the frequency of API calls.'
- 'INVALID_REQUEST: Check the parameters passed in the request.'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
