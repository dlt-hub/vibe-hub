- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Jet Admin
- Some API responses may contain nulls in deeply nested fields
- Setup of connected app in api is required.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token.
- API keys are deprecated by the end of January 2024.
- Personal access tokens allow you to more securely grant API access to Airtable data.
- Airtable API requires API key for authentication
- Airtable's API keys stopped working and you will have to migrate to personal access
  tokens.

- This video might be partially outdated due to product changes - we'll replace it
  with the fresh one soon.
- However, you still can use the concepts from it and apply them to the current version
- OAuth2 authentication is required for API access.
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup.
- Data may vary based on user permissions.

- Disabling VPN solved the problem - this is the most common reason for such an error.
  After disabling it, reload the page.
- Even though the query was correct, it didn't account for the fact that Jet handles
  filtering automatically, so you should not add the `WHERE` clause.
- Created actions won’t be copied, you will need to add them manually.
- If you've added new SQL tables to your database, you will need to manually select
  new tables to load into JetAdmin.
- Make sure there are no network restrictions.
- Check whether your Jet Bridge is the latest version.
- Check your CORS policies in Django.
- By default, there is a parameter in Jet Bridge for Django that contains CORS in
  settings.py called 'JET_CORS_HEADERS'.
- It is enabled by default and filled automatically, but if your Django already has
  an app called 'corsheaders' then it turns off.
- You can configure your CORS settings in the 'corsheaders' app instead.
- Alternatively, you can try to force 'JET_CORS_HEADERS' to be set to True, but it
  can lead to strange effects, so we would advise trying it only as a last resort.
- Disabling VPN solved the problem - this is the most common reason for such an error.
- omit WHERE and only set up the inputs and reference them in the query.
- Some API features may require additional permissions.
- Ensure OAuth2 token is valid before making API calls.
- To familiarize yourself with how Jet works, let's build a simple CRM that will allow
  us to View and Edit the Customers.
- Some endpoints may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- 'Priority field configured as Select with options: High, Medium, Low'
- Company id links Deals to Companies
- Requires OAuth2 authentication setup
- Check API documentation for rate limits
- To familiarize yourself with how Jet works
- Requires OAuth2 setup for API access
- Rate limiting may apply based on user tier
- OAuth2 setup is required for authentication.
- Make sure to handle token expiration properly.
- Components are prebuilt UI elements your users engage in, such as Tables, Forms,
  Buttons.
- Ensure correct API endpoint structure for data retrieval
- Authentication must be configured for data access
- Users will be able to interact only with their data
- Requires an API token for access.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.

- In Jet Admin, you can customize the appearance of your Portal for better usability.
- In Airtable, field types are detected automatically.
- For Client-side pagination, filters, sorting, and pagination are applied automatically
  — no additional configuration needed.
- Some responses may include nested fields with nullable values
- Requires configuration of OAuth and API keys.
- Maximum limit number of emails to be sent is 10 emails per 1 minute.

- Effective agents start with clear and detailed configuration. Providing precise
  instructions, well-defined inputs, and carefully selected settings and tools ensures
  your agent performs accurately and reliably.
- Agents don’t run on their own—they need to be triggered manually or programmatically.
- To run an agent automatically—such as on a schedule or after receiving a webhook—you'll
  need to create an Automation that includes the Invoke Agent block.
- AI prompter allows you to build complex formulas simply by describing what you want
  to achieve.
