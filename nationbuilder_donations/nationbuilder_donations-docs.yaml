auth_info:
- information_source; https://nationbuilder.com/api_quickstart:
  - OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with client credentials. Exchange authorization
    code for access token via POST to https://{slug}.nationbuilder.com/oauth/token
    with JSON body containing grant_type (authorization_code), code, client_id, client_secret,
    and redirect_uri. Response includes access_token (bearer token) and refresh_token.
    Use access_token in query parameter access_token on API requests. Access tokens
    expire after 24 hours and require refresh token flow implementation to obtain
    new tokens.
- information_source; https://support.nationbuilder.com/en/articles/9180281-api-authentication-quick-start-guide:
  - 'NationBuilder uses OAuth2 with refresh token flow. To refresh an expired access
    token, make a POST request to `https://{slug}.nationbuilder.com/oauth/token` with
    form parameters: `grant_type=refresh_token`, `refresh_token=<your_refresh_token>`,
    `client_id=<your_client_id>`, and `client_secret=<your_client_secret>`. The response
    includes a new `access_token` (Bearer token type), `refresh_token`, `expires_in`
    (seconds, default 86400), and `created_at` timestamp. You can either proactively
    refresh before expiration using the `expires_in` value, or handle the 401 `token_expired`
    error response when the token has already expired and then refresh.'
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow is used. Exchange an authorization code for an
    access token by posting to the token endpoint with grant_type=authorization_code,
    client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri. The response contains an access_token
    with token_type bearer. Use the access token in subsequent API requests via the
    access_token query parameter.
- information_source; https://support.nationbuilder.com/en/articles/9559128-generating-api-tokens:
  - NationBuilder API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Access tokens are sent
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" and expire after 24
    hours. To refresh an expired token, send a POST request to https://www.nationbuilder.com/oauth/token
    with grant_type set to "refresh_token", along with your refresh_token, client_id,
    and client_secret in the JSON request body.
- information_source; https://support.nationbuilder.com/en/articles/9903805-api-authentication-guide:
  - NationBuilder uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Admins must log in and grant
    application access to their nation. After authorization, exchange the code (via
    POST to https://{slug}.nationbuilder.com/oauth/token with grant_type=authorization_code,
    code, client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri in JSON body) for an access token.
    The code expires after 10 minutes. Obtain client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri
    from Settings > Developer > Your apps.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://nationbuilder.com/donations_api:
  - 'The response includes pagination fields: a "next" field containing the URL for
    the next page of results (with query parameters including limit and succeeded_since),
    and a "prev" field for the previous page (null when at the start). To paginate,
    use the URL provided in the "next" field for subsequent requests until "next"
    becomes null.'
  - Use the `limit` query parameter (max 100, optional) to control page size. The
    response includes `next` and `prev` fields containing full URLs with `__nonce`
    and `__token` pagination tokens; use the `next` URL to fetch the next page, and
    stop when `next` is null.
