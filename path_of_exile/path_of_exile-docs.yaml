auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/reference:
  - Required scope service:leagues for listing and retrieving leagues, and service:leagues:ladder
    for accessing league ladders. Scope-based authorization is used; no explicit headers,
    API keys, or tokens are detailed in this documentation chunk.
  - Required scope service:leagues:ladder. This endpoint requires OAuth2 authentication
    with the service:leagues:ladder scope to access league ladder data.
  - 'Required scope: service:leagues:ladder. This endpoint requires OAuth2 authorization
    with the service:leagues:ladder scope. The access token must be provided in the
    Authorization header as a Bearer token (Authorization: Bearer <access_token>).'
  - The documentation describes required OAuth2 scopes for API endpoints. To access
    the PvP Match Ladder endpoint, the scope service:pvp_matches:ladder is required.
    To access Account Leagues, the scope account:leagues is required. These scopes
    must be granted during OAuth2 authorization to use the respective endpoints. The
    actual authentication mechanism (bearer token in Authorization header) is not
    detailed in this excerpt, but follows standard OAuth2 patterns where an access
    token with the required scopes is passed as a bearer token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/reference:
  - Pagination is controlled by optional query parameters limit (default 20, maximum
    200) and offset for scrolling through results. The response includes a total field
    indicating total entries, with a hard limit of 15000 entries per ladder; requests
    beyond this return empty results.
  - The List Leagues endpoint uses offset-based pagination with optional query parameters
    limit (default 50, maximum 50) and offset to scroll through results. The response
    returns a leagues array containing up to limit matching leagues.
  - The endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameters limit (default
    20, max 500) and offset to scroll through results. Each ladder contains maximum
    15000 entries; requests beyond this return empty results.
  - 'Use offset and limit query parameters to paginate: offset specifies the starting
    position (used with limit to scroll through results), and limit restricts results
    returned (default 20, maximum 500). Each ladder contains only top 15000 entries;
    requesting beyond this returns empty results.'
