  Sweden on the Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen) and Fire TV Stick 4K Max devices.
- Not all retail marketplaces have an Amazon Appstore marketplace.
- Default app availability is in every marketplace unless restricted.
- App Submission API requires authentication.
- Users can find apps using search, browse, and recommendations.
- Amazon Appstore apps are available in nearly 200 countries.
- App Submission API requires OAuth2 authentication
- Amazon Appstore for Android is now discontinued. You can no longer submit or update
  apps for Android mobile devices.
- Changes to account ownership take effect immediately.
- Amazon requires two-step verification when you add or edit payment information in
  the Developer Console.
- If you are under 18, a parent or guardian is required to create an Amazon Appstore
  developer account.
- Identity verification and Amazon developer account setup isn't currently supported

- 'Last updated: Oct 16, 2023'
- Updating privacy data is a metadata update and doesn't require a new app version.
- Starting April 2023, the User data privacy questionnaire becomes available for apps
  that collect user data.
- Starting November 2023, a User Data Privacy section will be visible on app detail
  pages.
- User account and data deletion information will be available on the Amazon Appstore
  on Fire tablets, Fire TV devices, and Amazon.com.
- Providing user account and data deletion information helps keep privacy a priority,
  and can help increase user trust in your app.
- App bundles are optional. You can continue submitting apps using the existing APK
  format.
- LAT supports app bundles. The Appstore recommends using LAT to test your app bundle
  before submitting your app to be published live.
- If you are planning to update your binary file, you must fix compatibility issues
  in your manifest in order to maintain your current device support.
- Using <compatible-screens> is not recommended. This element can dramatically reduce
  the number of devices available to your application.
- When you submit your app to the Amazon Appstore, you must include various screenshots
  of your app to include with your app's listing.
- The language support selection here doesn't influence whether your app becomes available
  in localized Appstore marketplaces.
- The package name in your app must be unique and shouldn't include 'amazon' in the
  name.
- Device support has been reduced from the previous version. Some existing customers
  will not be able to upgrade.
- To resolve manifest conflicts, Amazon recommends editing the manifest to retain
  your current device support.
- The incompatibility could be due to the API level, OpenGL compression format, CPU,
  screen size and density, device features, or other factors about your app such as
  lack of availability in the geographic locale.
- Multiple binaries cannot support the same device.
- When a new Amazon device is released, the Amazon Appstore detects if your app is
  compatible with the device and, if so, automatically makes your app available on
  that device.
- The image extension must match the actual image type.
- If the required image size isn't proportional for the required space, your image
  will be placed on top of a background image that fills the space correctly.
- Amazon wants to ensure that apps listed in the Amazon Appstore meet certain quality
  requirements.
- Apps cannot be updated while they are in the Amazon review process.
- Any app can participate in staged rollout.
- You must select Edit staged rollout from the Staged rollout drop-down menu after
  halting a staged rollout.
- You cannot lower the rollout percentage.
- No approval is needed for each incremental increase.
- Limited to new versions for existing apps
- Only the app file is included
- Android app files only
- The app self-suppression feature is available to Android app submissions only.
- This feature doesn't support web app submissions.

  the App Submission API, this means the app is pending and might be in the review
  state.

  as increased visibility.
