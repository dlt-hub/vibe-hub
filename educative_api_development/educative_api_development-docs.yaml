auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.educative.io/blog/great-web-apis-for-web-development:
  - Use an access token generated from a Meta developer account. Include the access
    token in requests to the Graph API endpoints; the documentation indicates you
    generate this token and use it to make requests, though the exact header or parameter
    name for passing the token is not specified in this excerpt.

  - Transport layer requires HTTPS. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 access tokens, OpenID
    Connect, JWT bearer tokens, or API keys. Authorization enforces scopes, roles,
    or claims with least privilege per endpoint. Access tokens should be short-lived
    with refresh token rotation; server-side secrets stored securely. CORS policies,
    CSRF protection, rate limits, and audit logs provide additional security.

  - 'Authentication is performed by sending client_id and client_secret as query parameters
    in the URL. The client_id and APP_SECRET (client_secret) must be included in the
    params dictionary passed to the GET request, where params = {''client_id'': CLIENT_ID,
    ''client_secret'': APP_SECRET}.'
  - HTTP basic authentication using CLIENT_ID and APP_SECRET passed via the Authorization
    header, or alternatively pass CLIENT_ID and APP_SECRET as query parameters named
    client_id and client_secret respectively.
