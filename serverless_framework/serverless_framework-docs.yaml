  - 'Clients must add API keys in the `x-api-key` header when `private: true` is set.
    Custom authorizers can be configured to validate tokens from the `Authorization`
    header (via `identitySource: method.request.header.Authorization`) with optional
    regex validation (`identityValidationExpression`), and the authorizer function
    processes either just the token or the full request event based on the `type`
    parameter.'
- information_source; https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/license-keys:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required in the Authorization header. Access keys
    are passed as Bearer tokens in the format "Authorization: Bearer <access-key>".
    License keys can alternatively be provided via the SERVERLESS_LICENSE_KEY environment
    variable or the licenseKey field in serverless.yml configuration file.'
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer <access-key>" for all requests to the accesskeys API endpoints.
  - License Keys are simple identifiers used to authenticate access to Serverless
    Framework V4 and validate subscription usage. They are provided as environment
    variables or CLI configuration and disable Dashboard access, making remote requests
    only for License Key validation and telemetry. To manage License Keys programmatically,
    you need an orgId (from Settings > General) and an access key (from Settings >
    Access Keys), which are then used in API requests to the core.serverless.com endpoint.
- information_source; https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api:
  - 'JWT authorization is used to restrict access to HTTP API endpoints. Credentials
    are sent via the Authorization header (identitySource: $request.header.Authorization),
    validated against an issuer URL (typically AWS Cognito), and matched against configured
    audience values (client IDs). Optional scopes can be specified per endpoint to
    enforce fine-grained permissions.'
