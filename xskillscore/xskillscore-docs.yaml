notes:
- Uses contingency-based scoring for bin edges
- API does not require authentication.
- Uses xarray for dataset manipulation and metrics calculation
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Can be used on tabular data such as that stored in a pandas.DataFrame.
