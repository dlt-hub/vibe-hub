  - Any access to the Developer API is authenticated with a valid API key. Sprinto
    admin users can generate an API key from the Sprinto app. Currently only Sprinto
    admin users can generate API keys, and all keys have complete access to the available
    graph.
  - The Sprinto GraphQL API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the
    request headers (exact header name not explicitly stated in this excerpt, but
    standard practice is Authorization header). The API key should be generated from
    the Sprinto app and stored in an environment variable rather than hardcoded to
    avoid exposing credentials. Base URL for all requests is https://app.sprinto.com/dev-api/graphql.
