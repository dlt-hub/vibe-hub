auth_info:
- information_source; https://upcloud.com/docs/guides/deploying-server-upcloud-api/:
  - Base64 authentication is required for all API requests, including POST /1.3/server.
    Credentials must be sent as Base64-encoded username and password in the Authorization
    header using the standard HTTP Basic Authentication scheme.
- information_source; https://upcloud.com/docs/guides/getting-started-upcloud-api/:
  - 'The UpCloud API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Encode your username and password
    as "username:password" in Base64, then send it in the Authorization header as
    "Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>". For example in Python: auth
    = base64.b64encode("username:password".encode()) and include it in the Authorization
    header of your HTTPS requests to api.upcloud.com.'
  - The UpCloud API uses HTTP Basic authentication. The Authorization header must
    contain the API username and password Base64 encoded in the format "username:password".
    Credentials are sent as a single Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header
    for each request.
  - UpCloud API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API username and password.
    Create a separate API user account in the UpCloud Control Panel, set an API password,
    and enable API access permissions. Use the API username and password as credentials
    for Basic Auth when making requests to https://api.upcloud.com. The API account
    has configurable permissions for servers, storage, and tags, with full permissions
    to resources it creates by default.
