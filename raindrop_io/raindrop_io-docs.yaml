auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.raindrop.io:
  - You must register your application and authenticate with OAuth when making requests
    to the Raindrop.io API. The API uses OAuth for authentication, requiring applications
    to be registered at app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations before making authenticated
    requests.
- information_source; https://developer.raindrop.io/:
  - You must register your application and authenticate with OAuth. The documentation
    indicates that OAuth authentication is required for making requests to the Raindrop.io
    API, and applications must be registered at app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations
    before use.
- information_source; https://developer.raindrop.io/v1/authentication/token:
  - External applications use OAuth2 protocol to obtain user-authorized API tokens.
    Developers must register applications in the App Management Console, configure
    a valid OAuth redirect URL, and follow a three-step token exchange process including
    authorization request, redirection callback, and token exchange, plus support
    for access token refresh.
  - OAuth2 authentication is used. Developers must register applications in the App
    Management Console to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. For testing, a Test
    token can be copied from app settings and used directly. The OAuth2 authorization
    flow starts with a GET request to https://raindrop.io/oauth/authorize with query
    parameters client_id (the unique Client ID of the registered app) and redirect_uri
    (the configured redirect URL). Alternatively, for accessing only your own account
    data, use the Test token as described in the Make authorized calls section.
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is required. Step 1: redirect user to https://api.raindrop.io/v1/oauth/authorize
    with query parameters client_id and redirect_uri. Step 2: user is redirected back
    to your redirect_uri with authorization code in query parameter code. Step 3:
    exchange code for access_token via POST to https://raindrop.io/oauth/access_token
    with JSON body containing grant_type set to "authorization_code", code from step
    2, client_id, and client_secret. Content-Type header must be application/json.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.raindrop.io/v1/raindrops/multiple:
  - Pagination uses page (query parameter, 0-indexed) and perpage (query parameter,
    max 50) to control which raindrops are returned. The response structure for indicating
    pagination state or navigation fields is not documented in this excerpt.
