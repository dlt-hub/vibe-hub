  - Access tokens expire after 60 minutes (default) and are sent in API requests.
    When an access token expires, use the refresh token to obtain a new one by making
    a POST request to /api/oauth/token with parameters client_id, client_secret, grant_type
    set to "refresh_token", and the refresh_token value in the request body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    The refresh token expires if the app is disconnected, the client secret is rolled,
    or the app connection is re-authorized after a scope change; if both tokens expire,
    the OAuth flow must be restarted.
  - Authorization Code Flow (OAuth2) is used for server-side applications where the
    client secret can be maintained confidentially. The flow requires redirecting
    users to https://api.getjobber.com/api/oauth/authorize with response_type=code,
    client_id set to your Client ID from the Developer Center, redirect_uri set to
    your callback URL (must be URL encoded and configured in Developer Center), and
    an optional state parameter for security verification. After user authorization,
    Jobber redirects back to your callback URL with an authorization code and the
    state parameter (if provided).
  - Jobber uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. In step 4, your application exchanges
    an authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to https://api.getjobber.com/api/oauth/token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, sending client_id, client_secret,
    grant_type set to authorization_code, code (the authorization code from step 3),
    and redirect_uri as form parameters. You must use HTTPS. The state parameter from
    step 1 should be validated against the state returned in step 3's redirect.
  - OAuth2 authorization code flow with access and refresh tokens. Access tokens are
    sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" to authenticate API
    requests to https://api.getjobber.com/api/graphql. Refresh tokens are used to
    obtain new access tokens; token rotation behavior depends on configuration (OFF
    returns same refresh token, ON returns new refresh token each time). Invalid tokens
    return 401 "invalid_request" error. Disconnects invalidate all tokens and trigger
    APP_DISCONNECT webhook.
- information_source; https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/getting_started/:
  - Jobber uses OAuth 2.0 for app authorization. Apps define scopes to control what
    data they can read or write via the GraphQL API, and these scopes are shown to
    users during the OAuth authorization screen. Access tokens obtained through the
    OAuth 2.0 flow are valid for 60 minutes. Scopes can be freely edited while an
    app is in Draft state, but published apps requiring additional scopes will require
    users to re-authorize.
