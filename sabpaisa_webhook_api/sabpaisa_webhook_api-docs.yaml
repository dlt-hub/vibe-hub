auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.sabpaisa.in/docs/webhook-api/:
  - Merchant credentials provided by SabPaisa are required for authentication. Webhook
    payloads are encrypted and must be decrypted using the same auth key, auth IV,
    and algorithms provided by SabPaisa's payment gateway. Your webhook endpoint must
    respond with a 200 OK status to acknowledge receipt.
- information_source; https://developer.sabpaisa.in/docs/laravel/:
  - Encryption-based request authentication using AES256-HMAC-SHA384. Merchants must
    encrypt request data (encData) using an authKey and authIV via AES256HMACSHA384HEX
    encryption, and decrypt callback responses (encResponse) using the same keys and
    algorithm. The encrypted payload is sent as the encData parameter in requests
    and received as encResponse in POST callbacks to the callbackUrl.
- information_source; https://developer.sabpaisa.in/docs/java/:
  - Requests and callbacks use AES256 encryption with HMAC-SHA384 authentication.
    Encryption requires authKey and authIV parameters, and responses are sent as an
    encResponse parameter via POST to the merchant's callbackUrl. Decryption uses
    the same authKey and authIV to retrieve plaintext parameters separated by ampersands.
- information_source; https://developer.sabpaisa.in/docs/net/:
  - The API requires encrypted request data (encData parameter) containing client
    credentials and transaction details. The encData string must include clientCode,
    transUserName, and transUserPassword along with transaction parameters like payerName,
    payerEmail, payerMobile, clientTxnId, amount, callbackUrl, and channelId. All
    mandatory parameters must be present in the encrypted string or the request will
    fail with a "Missed Mandatory parameter null" error.
- information_source; https://developer.sabpaisa.in/docs/python/:
  - The API uses encryption-decryption for request and response handling. Requests
    must include an encData parameter containing encrypted data using the provided
    authKey and authIV. Responses are sent via POST callback to the callbackUrl with
    an encResponse parameter that must be decrypted using the same authKey and authIV.
    Transaction IDs (TxnId) must be randomly generated for each transaction to avoid
    duplicate transaction ID errors from the payment gateway.
