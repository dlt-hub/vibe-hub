notes:
- This service takes as input an image and returns a json with information about the
  probability that it includes NSFW content.
- Check out the navigation bar for all the how-to guides regarding this project.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Access the Core engine Backend documentation at http://localhost:8080/docs.
- Access the Core engine Frontend on http://localhost:3000.
- Access the service documentation at http://localhost:9090/docs.
- This service rotates images by 90, 180, 270 degrees clockwise depending on the value
  of the `rotation` parameter.
- Rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise depending on the value of the `rotation`
  parameter. (90, 180, 270)
- Model binary file saved in 'model-creation/model/anomalies_detection_model.h5'.
- Training loss plot saved in 'model-creation/evaluation/training_loss.png'.
- Anomaly detection plot saved in 'model-creation/evaluation/result.png'.
- The service expects a CSV file with a single column containing the time series data.
- The service returns a plot of the time series with the detected anomalies highlighted
  in red.
- The second step will only be executed if the first step detects at least one face.
- Follow the official tutorials to learn how to create a new service.
- Follow the official tutorials to learn how to create a new service
- If your repository is part of the Swiss AI Center GitHub organization, most of the
  following secrets are already set for you.
- All `DEV_*` secrets can be duplicated to `PROD_*` secrets to deploy the service
  on the production environment.
- All `DEV_*` variables can be duplicated to `PROD_*` variables to deploy the service
  on the production environment.
- Disable Wikis.
- Disable Projects.
- Change visibility of the repository to Private or Public.
- Install DVC with pip, ensure to install with s3 optional dependencies.
- Use aws configure to add your Access Key ID and your Secret Access Key.
- This is a work in progress. It has not been tested yet.
- PROD_DATABASE_URL must be saved with postgresql:// protocol. The default value is
  postgresql://.
- All the tasks will be executed linked to an element called PipelineExecution.
- The Core engine will wait for the previous task to be finished before launching
  the next one.
- Start the service with Docker Compose (recommended)
- Start the service locally with plain Python
- This service uses an autoencoder model to detect an anomaly in a time series.
- The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI standard.
- Your dataset label column must be called 'target'.
- Avoid having multiple empty lines at the end of the file.
- A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the /docs route.
- The model must take only one image as input.
- If you specify nothing, the whole json will be returned.
- This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query text-to-image AI models.
- This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query text-to-text AI models.
- This service uses Hugging Face's model hub API to directly query AI models.
- The bounding boxes are drawn as red unfilled rectangles at the coordinates specified
  by the 4 fields above.
- The JSON file may contain additional fields; they will be ignored.
- The detection usually works well starting from a couple of phrases.
- If multiple languages are present in the input text, then the detection will output
  the most present language.
- This simple service only has one route /compute that takes a mp3 file as input,
  which will be analyzed.
- The Core engine allows to create and manage pipelines of microservices.
- Another service is available, GlitchTip, to centralize the logging errors thrown
  by the Core engine and its services.
- The Core engine Backend StatefulSet must be deleted and recreated every time a new
  Docker image is created.
- The service StatefulSet must be deleted and recreated every time a new Docker image
  is created.
- Designed to prepare datasets for machine learning tasks such as image classification,
  object detection, and image generation.
- Before using this service, you need to vectorize a pdf document using the document-vectorizer
  service.
- Docker is used in many repo of the project to build images and run containers
- Docker compose is used in many repo of the project to launch the local development
  environment
- The .env file should be placed in the root of the project.
- Pydantic will automatically read the file and load the environment variables into
  the application when using the BaseSettings class.
- The configuration for DVC is available in the .dvc directory and the dvc.yaml file.
- In order to deploy Kubernetes pods with a domain name, an Ingress controller must
  be deployed.
- flake8 is used in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the code quality is maintained
  and that the code is consistent across the project.
- A secret can only be updated, not viewed. Please be careful to have a copy of the
  secrets you store on GitHub Secrets.
- An account or a Kube config file is necessary to access the Kubernetes cluster.
- We use Material for MkDocs to generate the documentation website.
- We use minikube to deploy our platform locally for development purposes.
- PostgreSQL can be used for development as well.
- We use pytest to test our services.
- None.
- Circular dependencies can be a problem.
- Inheritance issues with SQLModel.
errors:
- Pending tasks will not have output available until they are finished.
