notes:
- Connecting to an active staging/testing environment hosted by TSG Global.
- Throughput may occasionally become an issue.
- TSG Global makes sending and receiving SMS easy.
- 'Authentication is done by passing your TSG Global API key via the Authorization
  header in the format ''Authorization: Bearer <api_key>''.'
- We donâ€™t recommend using this endpoint - perhaps only for testing. For production
  traffic, we recommend registering a webhook.
- We highly recommend you connect via TLS in order to securely transport your messages
  to us.
- Requesting DLR for the message to be sent to you requires setting 'request_delivery_reports'
  to true
- All requests are made using the POST HTTP Verb to the specified endpoint.
- It is recommended to utilize the TLS port when capable. TLS supports versions 1.1
  and 1.2.
- Per your MSA, there is a 90 day number holding requirement.
- You can not specify a disconnect date.
- Webhook API specification available on the next page
- After ordering toll-free numbers, you should register a campaign for them using
  the Toll-Free Verified Sender Form.
- Failure to provide VSFs results in blocking to Canada and lower throughputs to US
  destinations for toll-free numbers.
- You can generate a Bearer token to access our GraphQL API using the username and
  password you use to access our Customer Portal.
- This token lasts for 7 days.
- Handles SMS sending and receiving with compliance to global regulations.
