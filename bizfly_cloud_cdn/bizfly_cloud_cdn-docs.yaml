auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bizflycloud.vn/cdn/resources/api/:
  - 'BizflyCloud CDN API uses two required headers for authentication: X-Auth-Token
    and X-Tenant-Name. The X-Auth-Token is a bearer token obtained from the API authentication
    endpoint, and X-Tenant-Name contains the tenant identifier (typically an email
    address). Both headers must be included in every API request to the CDN API endpoint
    at https://api.cdn.bizflycloud.vn/v3/.'
  - 'The API requires two headers for authentication: X-Tenant-Name containing the
    tenant identifier (e.g., huyleviet@vccloud.vn) and X-Auth-Token containing a bearer
    token (e.g., gAAAAABgFicAtTVZ4-2QVUxuowaKLDD7CGBe5fMsG5ISN5r7cvLhQAfB7Z9RaGbGgRvcGfY5qzxPr_aSRtbg2P9t7obroeuhXOOkuGSxpdfbVOYejOITp7A_xk2RJmZO5Js-yZAJmk5cnVUCc1FfP-LRRK6FyVLHx4shiogldyY95pUxWvV8z-jIQBw0_iqZ2GsI).
    Both headers must be included in every request.'
  - 'The API uses token-based authentication. Requests require two headers: X-Tenant-Name
    (containing the tenant email) and X-Auth-Token (containing the authentication
    token). The token appears to be a bearer token that must be obtained separately
    and included in each request.'
  - X-Auth-Token header is required for authentication. Send the token value in the
    X-Auth-Token request header. Additionally, X-Tenant-Name header must be included
    in requests.
  - X-Tenant-Name and X-Auth-Token headers are required for authentication. X-Tenant-Name
    contains the tenant identifier (email format in examples), and X-Auth-Token contains
    a bearer token that must be included in every request to the API.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bizflycloud.vn/cdn/resources/api/:
  - The API uses query parameter pagination with page and limit parameters. The response
    includes total (total count), pages (total pages), next and prev (URIs for next/previous
    pages), and results (the paginated data array). Stop paginating when the current
    page reaches the pages value or when next/prev URIs match the current page.
- information_source; https://docs.bizflycloud.vn/business_email/api/:
  - Query parameters page (optional, int) and per_page (optional, int) control pagination
    for the organizations list endpoint. The documentation does not specify response
    fields indicating pagination state or how to determine when to stop paginating.
  - Use page[number] as a query parameter (optional) to paginate through the member
    list. The documentation does not specify response fields indicating pagination
    state, total pages, or how to determine when pagination ends.
