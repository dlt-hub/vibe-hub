auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.clicktime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002884071-REST-API-v2-General-Information:
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is used to obtain a token from the "Me" endpoint. Send
    a GET request to https://api.clicktime.com/v2/me with credentials formatted as
    EMAIL:PASSWORD either via the --user flag or as a Base64-encoded string in the
    Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Basic ENCODED_STRING" where
    ENCODED_STRING is the Base64 encoding of EMAIL:PASSWORD.'
  - 'Clients authenticate using a custom per-user token sent in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Token {token}". The token is obtained by logging into
    the web application under "My Preferences" > "Authentication Token" tab, or via
    Basic authentication against the "Me" endpoint. Tokens do not expire based on
    time but can be manually invalidated and regenerated through "My Preferences"
    or the "Me/ResetAuthToken" endpoint.'
  - Set the Authorization header as usual for batch requests to /v2/$batch. The documentation
    references standard authorization but does not explicitly specify the auth scheme,
    header name, or credential format in this excerpt.
  - The ClickTime v2 REST API supports two authentication methods. Most endpoints
    require token authentication, while the GET /Me endpoint and POST /Me/ResetAuthToken
    endpoint support basic HTTP authentication using email and password credentials.
    Basic authentication allows you to retrieve your API token from the Me endpoint,
    which can then be used for other API calls.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://support.clicktime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002884071-REST-API-v2-General-Information:
  - The API uses Link headers containing first and last page links constructed with
    offset and limit query parameters for pagination.
  - 'The API uses page-based pagination with a count parameter in responses showing
    total results to calculate expected pages. Different endpoints have different
    maximum page sizes: GET /TimeEntries has a maximum of 100, while GET /Reports/Time
    has a default of 2,500.'
  - The page element contains pagination data including count (total results), offset
    (position from first result), and limit (results per response). It provides a
    links object with absolute URLs to first, last, next, previous, and current pages.
    Response Link headers also contain first and last page links using offset and
    limit query parameters.
