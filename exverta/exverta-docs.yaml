    include it with requests, though the specific header name and transmission method
    are not detailed in this excerpt.
  - 'API requests require two headers for authentication: X-API-Key and X-API-Secret.
    Both must be included in the request headers for all endpoints. The X-API-Key
    header holds your API key and X-API-Secret header holds your API secret. Missing
    or invalid API keys return error code 2001.'
  - 'API requests require two headers for authentication: X-API-Key and X-API-Secret.

    header should contain your API key and the X-API-Secret header should contain
    your API secret.'
