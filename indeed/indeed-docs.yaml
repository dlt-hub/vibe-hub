auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.indeed.com/api/sponsored-jobs-api-ats/get-campaign-job-details:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication is required with the employer.advertising scope. Include
    an access token that represents employer permissions in the Authorization header
    as a Bearer token.
- information_source; https://docs.indeed.com/getstarted/integrate-and-call-apis:
  - Indeed uses OAuth2 for API authentication. Partners obtain a client ID and secret
    from Partner Console, then exchange these credentials for an access token by making
    a POST request to https://apis.indeed.com/oauth/v2/tokens with Accept and Content-Type
    headers. The access token is then included in Indeed API calls for authentication.
    For 3-legged OAuth apps, an authorization code is also required as part of the
    credential exchange process.
  - Indeed uses OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. To authenticate, POST to
    https://apis.indeed.com/oauth/v2/tokens with client_id, client_secret, grant_type=client_credentials,
    and scope=employer_access in the request body. The response contains an access_token
    with token_type Bearer that expires in 3600 seconds and must be refreshed hourly.
    Use the access_token in subsequent API calls as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header.
  - 'POST requests to https://apis.indeed.com/graphql require an Authorization header
    with a Bearer token in the format "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>". The
    access token must be refreshed hourly as it expires after 3600 seconds. Include
    Content-Type: application/json header with all requests.'
  - The Indeed API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Obtain OAuth credentials (client_id
    and client_secret) as a partner, then exchange them for an access token via the
    oauth/v2/tokens endpoint. Include the access token in HTTP request headers when
    calling Indeed APIs.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.indeed.com/api/sponsored-jobs-api-ats/get-campaign-job-details:
  - This endpoint uses offset-based pagination with a maximum of 500 results per page.
    Use the `offset` query parameter to request different pages, and validate consistency
    across pages using the `hash` parameter from the response; if the hash changes
    between requests, wait one minute and restart from offset 0.
