notes:
- API governance is important for any organization implementing an API First strategy.
- Governance traditionally gets a bad rep; it’s viewed as slow, manual, and error-prone.
- API Governance is the framework and set of practices that ensure your APIs are high
  quality, consistent and compliant, and aligned to business goals.
- Good governance is built in throughout the platform, including capabilities such
  as Governance families and levels to tailor rule sets to each API’s use case, driving
  flexibility.
- Embedded developer level governance in your repo such as GitHub, to reduce friction.
- API curation and business-level metadata governance to make sure you’re proud to
  put your logo on your exposed APIs.
- Well-governed API updates including impact analysis and change management.
- API governance reporting and tracking.
- Automated governance checking and bulk updates to make adherence quick and easy.
- API consumption governance to manage who can use your APIs (and where).
- Support for AI as a consumer of APIs.
- API governance is the framework and set of practices that make your APIs quality
  and usable.
- Governance can be slow and cumbersome, but by adopting best practices, you can transform
  your governance process.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Well-governed and automated to ensure chaos remains a thing of the past.
- Vendor-neutral API catalog powering multiple portals, kept active with governed-lifecycle
  management.

  to ensure no outages to production services.
- No more tool silos. No more lifecycle gaps.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The ignite Platform by digitalML improves developer efficiency by up to 50% by streamlining
  API discovery, governance, and lifecycle management.
- APIs are the connective tissue of modern enterprises, but without the right catalog,
  they become scattered, underused, and difficult to govern.
- 90% of enterprise APIs aren’t documented well enough to be consumable by AI tools.
- 'Updating APIs to be AI-Agent Ready: Why It Matters Now'
- 90% of enterprise APIs are not well documented.

- digitalML is committed to supporting large enterprises in their API maturity journey
  through our flagship ignite Platform.
- 'ignite is composed of three main platform areas: A Holistic API Catalog, API Consumer
  Portals, Extended API Lifecycle Management.'
- Your APIs need to be discovered, consumed, and reused to drive value and efficiency
  from your API program.
- One holistic catalog for all API types, connected through integrations with runtime
  platforms and pipelines.
- An API catalog is a centralized, searchable repository of all the APIs in your ecosystem.
- A Holistic API Catalog is the best choice for large enterprises.
- API versions and their corresponding documentation and any attachments need to be
  kept up to date and active in your portal.
- Agentic AI is here to help enterprises increase their productivity at scale.
- More than 60% of organizations rolling out AI agents identify API readiness and
  data governance as their top technical roadblocks.
- APIs are critical for internal services, partner integrations, and customer value.
- API chaos can arise from poor documentation and lack of standardization.
- A holistic API catalog is recommended for large enterprises.
- Embraces Representational State Transfer (REST) as the gold standard of API development
- Supports multiprotocol programs
- API reuse is a priority for enterprises aiming to enhance efficiency and achieve
  significant cost savings.
- API versioning involves managing and communicating changes to your APIs over time,
  without affecting your API consumers.
- A good versioning strategy is particularly important for large enterprises.
- Shifting to API reporting that’s unified across design, runtime, and consumption
  metrics ensures strategic decisions can be made on the entire API inventory.
- API lifecycle management is essential for enterprises to deliver high quality APIs.
- Banks face operational risk from improper API governance and lifecycle management.
- Banks have already transitioned to APIs.
- As APIs are scaled within banks, the governance load grows too.
- Some Banks are getting ahead using effective API lifecycle management with automated
  governance.
- Supports multiple API formats and flexible architecture
- Emphasis on unified reporting and metrics tracking
- A vendor neutral catalog of all your APIs, Services, Events, and Integrations, always
  active and in-sync with your repos and gateways.
- Multiple Consumer Portals to drive API adoption, reuse and collaboration. Powered
  and maintained from your single catalog.
- A well-defined versioning strategy is paramount for maintaining a robust connection
  between API providers and consumers, especially for large enterprises managing vast
  API ecosystems.
- Abstracting your APIs provides a unique solution and can be used to deliver all
  of the needs above, in supporting API first at scale.
- API catalog serves as the centralized repository for an enterprise’s entire API
  inventory.
- API portal is the interface where API consumers go to discover and onboard APIs.
- API metrics aids enterprises in making business decisions on their API program.
- Enterprises cannot unlock the true value of AI without first getting their API house
  in order.
- API lifecycle management and proper API governance are core to the platform, ensuring
  APIs are high quality and consistent at scale.
- A vendor-neutral API catalog powering multiple portals, kept active with governed-lifecycle
  management.
- Complete control, visibility, and flexibility to drive more value from your APIs.
- enterprises cannot unlock the true value of AI without first getting their API house
  in order

- The portal supports any consumption use case
- The Consumer Portal is customizable by design
- Data privacy is a fundamental human right.
- Standard tactics include encryption and tokenization, access controls, and masking
  for the APIs.
- Supports multiple consumption use cases across multiple API types.
- Without the right tools to assist teams in rapidly delivering APIs while aligning
  with a canonical model, these practices may prove so labor intensive that deadline-driven
  teams choose a more expedient path.
- The Consumer Portal is customizable by design, and you can implement as many of
  them as you want.
- The portal supports multiple types of APIs and API product bundles.
- APIs should be built with future utility in mind.
