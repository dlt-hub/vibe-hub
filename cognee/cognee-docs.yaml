auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.cognee.ai/api-reference/introduction:
  - API key authentication is required for Cogwit deployments. Send the API key in
    the X-Api-Key header with each request. For local deployments at http://localhost:8000,
    the API key is optional. The header name is X-Api-Key and should be included in
    the headers dictionary of your HTTP requests.
  - All requests require an API key sent in the X-Api-Key header with the value YOUR-API-KEY.
    The Content-Type header should be set to application/json. Obtain your API key
    from the Cogwit dashboard at https://platform.cognee.ai/.
  - All requests to the Cognee API require an API key passed in the X-Api-Key header.
    For Cogwit Cloud, obtain your API key by signing up at platform.cognee.ai and
    creating it in your dashboard. Local Docker setup has optional authentication
    that can be disabled for development.
- information_source; https://docs.cognee.ai/api-reference/root:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer <token>", where <token> is your auth token. The Authorization header
    is required for all requests.
  - 'The API requires Bearer token authentication passed in the Authorization header.
    Include the header Authorization: Bearer <token> with each request to authenticate.'
