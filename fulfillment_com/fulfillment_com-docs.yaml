auth_info:
- information_source; https://fulfillment.github.io/api/:
  - 'Authorizations: fdcAuth


    This endpoint requires fdcAuth authorization. No further details about the fdcAuth
    mechanism, credentials format, or how to provide it are specified in the provided
    documentation.'
  - OAuth v2.0 authentication with implicit or password grant types. Obtain client_id
    and client_secret from your account executive. Send access_token in the Authorization
    header as Bearer {access_token}. Use refresh_token from POST /oauth/access_token
    to perpetuate access without storing passwords. Password grant requires username,
    password, client_id, and client_secret. Store both access_token and refresh_token
    for reuse; refresh the access_token when it expires using the refresh_token.
  - OAuth2 password grant flow using client_id and client_secret credentials. Send
    POST request to /oauth/access_token with username, password, grant_type set to
    "password", client_id, and client_secret in JSON body. Response includes access_token
    (Bearer token type), refresh_token, and expires_in. Use the access_token in subsequent
    requests via fdcAuth authorization scheme.
  - The API uses fdcAuth as the authorization scheme. This is a custom authentication
    mechanism specific to FDC; however, the documentation does not provide explicit
    details on how to implement fdcAuth, such as the header name, parameter name,
    token format, or how to obtain credentials. To use this endpoint, you would need
    to refer to additional FDC authentication documentation or contact FDC support
    for the specific implementation details of fdcAuth.
  - The API uses fdcAuth authorization. This is a named authorization scheme that
    must be configured to access the endpoint. The specific implementation details
    of fdcAuth (such as header name, token format, or credential location) are not
    provided in this documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://fulfillment.github.io/api/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer >= 1, default 1) and limit (integer
    1-200, default 80), where page is a multiplier of limit to skip results. Response
    includes meta.pagination with totalPages, currentPage, count, and total fields
    to indicate pagination state.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, >= 1, default 1) and limit (integer,
    1-200, default 80). The page parameter multiplies the limit to determine how many
    items to skip; construct subsequent requests by incrementing the page value until
    all results are retrieved.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (integer, >= 1, default 1) and limit (integer,
    1-200, default 80). The page parameter multiplies the limit to determine offset;
    construct subsequent requests by incrementing page. Response includes meta and
    data objects; stop when data array is empty or fewer items than limit are returned.
  - Request uses page (query parameter, integer >= 1, default 1) and limit (query
    parameter, integer 1-200, default 80) for pagination. Response includes meta.pagination
    object with totalPages, currentPage, and count fields to indicate pagination state.
  - Use query parameters page (integer >= 1, default 1) and limit (integer 1-200,
    default 80) to paginate results. The page parameter is a multiplier of limit to
    skip before returning results; increment page to retrieve subsequent pages until
    no more results are returned.
