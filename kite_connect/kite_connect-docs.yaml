auth_info:
- information_source; https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/user/:
  - API key and access token are passed as query parameters. The endpoint expects
    api_key and access_token query parameters to validate the session token. Both
    parameters are required for authentication.
  - 'Access tokens are passed as query parameters in logout requests: api_key and
    access_token. The X-Kite-Version header set to 3 is required. After logout, the
    access_token is invalidated and a new login flow is needed for subsequent API
    interactions.'
  - 'All requests must be authenticated using the HTTP Authorization header with the
    scheme "token" followed by the api_key and access_token separated by a colon,
    formatted as "Authorization: token api_key:access_token". The access_token expires
    at 6 AM the next day (regulatory requirement) unless invalidated via logout or
    master-logout from the Kite Web trading terminal, and can be refreshed using the
    refresh_token for approved platforms.'
  - Authentication and token exchange uses a two-step process. First, obtain an authorization
    code via a login redirect, then exchange it for an access token by sending a POST
    request with api_key, request_hash, and checksum parameters. Subsequent API requests
    require the access_token sent in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}"
    and the api_key in the X-Kite-Version header.
  - Authorization is performed using a token-based scheme. Send the API key and access
    token in the Authorization header with the format "token api_key:access_token",
    and include the X-Kite-Version header set to 3 in requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/alerts/:
  - Use query parameters page (page number) and page_size (number of alerts per page)
    to paginate through alert results. Response structure for pagination endpoints
    not detailed in provided excerpt.
