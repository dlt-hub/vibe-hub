auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.eegcloud.tv/docs/api:
  - The EEG Cloud API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key. Set the username
    to the literal string `api_key` and the password to your actual API key value
    (obtained from the API Keys menu in your account). Both username and password
    must be included in the Basic Auth header for each request. Do not use website
    username/password credentials as this approach is deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release.
