auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/greengrass/2017-06-07/openapi.json:
  - AWS Signature Version 4 signing is required for all requests to the AWS Greengrass
    API. Requests must be signed using AWS access key ID and secret access key credentials,
    with the signing name set to "greengrass". The signature is typically included
    in the Authorization header following the AWS SigV4 protocol.
  - The API uses an optional client token for request correlation. Send the X-Amzn-Client-Token
    header in requests; this is not a security credential but rather an idempotency
    or correlation mechanism.

  - Use query parameter MaxResults (optional) to specify maximum results per request,
    and NextToken (optional) to retrieve subsequent pages. The response includes NextToken
    field; when null, pagination is complete.
