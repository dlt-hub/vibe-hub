auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.fuze.finance:
  - HMAC SHA256 authentication is required for all requests. Sign the request payload,
    query parameters, API slug, and X-TIMESTAMP header using your apiSecret as the
    HMAC key to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Include the X-TIMESTAMP header
    with the request creation time. Credentials (apiKey and apiSecret) must be kept
    secure and rotated regularly using the rotate API key pair endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.fuze.finance/:
  - Fuze's REST APIs require HMAC SHA256 authentication. You must sign each request
    using your apiKey and apiSecret. The signature is created by HMAC-SHA256 hashing
    the request payload, query parameters, api slug, and X-TIMESTAMP header (request
    creation time) using your apiSecret as the key. Include the apiKey and X-TIMESTAMP
    in your request headers. Credentials must be kept secure and rotated regularly
    using the rotate API key pair endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.fuze.finance/authentication:
  - 'API requests require three headers: X-API-KEY (your Fuze API key), X-TIMESTAMP
    (Unix time in seconds), and X-SIGNATURE (HMAC SHA signature). The X-SIGNATURE
    is computed as a keyed HMAC using your API secret and must be included with every
    request for authentication.'
  - 'API requests require two custom headers for authentication: X-TIMESTAMP (Unix
    timestamp in milliseconds since epoch) and X-SIGNATURE (HMAC SHA256 signature).
    The X-SIGNATURE is generated by signing a JSON payload containing the request
    body, query parameters, URL slug, and X-TIMESTAMP value using the api-secret as
    the HMAC key. The JSON payload must maintain field order: body, query, url, ts.
    For GET requests with no parameters, use empty objects for body and query fields.'
  - OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <access_token>". The token must have BASE_MODULE
    WRITE or READWRITE permission; READ-only tokens will receive 401 responses.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.fuze.finance/walkthroughs/payments:
  - 'Pagination uses body parameters: pageSize (optional, default 50, max 100) specifies
    records per page, and pageNumber (optional, starting at 0) specifies the page.
    The response does not indicate total pages or a next page field, so pagination
    continues by incrementing pageNumber until fewer than pageSize records are returned.'
  - Pagination uses pageNumber (starting at 0) and pageSize (optional, default 50,
    max 100) parameters in the request body to control which records are returned
    per page. The response structure does not explicitly specify pagination metadata
    fields like total count or has_more, so you increment pageNumber to fetch subsequent
    pages until no more results are returned.
  - This endpoint supports limit-offset pagination via body parameters. Use pageNumber
    (optional, starting at 0) and pageSize (optional, default 50, max 100) to request
    specific pages. The response returns an array of records in the data field; continue
    paginating by incrementing pageNumber until fewer records than pageSize are returned.
  - 'pagination information extracted from the provided documentation chunk:


    The response includes a pagination object with page (current page number, 0-indexed),
    per_page (items per page, default 100), total (total number of results), and order
    (sort order). Request pagination by passing query parameters page and per_page
    in the POST request; stop when results returned are fewer than per_page or when
    page index reaches total divided by per_page.'
