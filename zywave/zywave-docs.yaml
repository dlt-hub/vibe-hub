auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.zywave.dev/apis/getting-started/testing-api-calls/:
  - API uses OAuth 2.0 code flow for authentication. After configuring authentication
    parameters and clicking Fetch Tokens, a sign-in pop-up appears where you authenticate
    and grant application access to Zywave data. Upon successful authentication, an
    ACCESS TOKEN is generated in the ACCESS TOKEN field, and optionally a REFRESH
    TOKEN if the offline_access scope was included. The ACCESS TOKEN is then used
    in subsequent API calls by copying the entire token value.
- information_source; https://www.zywave.dev/apis/getting-started/registering-an-app/:
  - Zywave API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Applications must be registered
    through Zywave Admin to obtain an automatically generated application secret,
    which is required for OAuth 2.0 authentication. Access tokens are retrieved from
    IdentityServer using configured grant types, and scopes determine what data and
    operations the application can access, with specific scopes tied to particular
    API endpoints (e.g., api.industries for Industries endpoint, api.companies for
    Lead insights endpoint).
- information_source; https://www.zywave.dev/apis/getting-started/authentication/:
  - 'OAuth2 authorization code flow is used to obtain an access_token by POSTing a
    code to https://auth.zywave.com/connect/token. For v2.x APIs, include the access_token
    in the request header and specify a profile either as "Profile: {TypeCode} {ID}"
    or "Profile: Token {ProfileToken}" header value. Access tokens expire and require
    re-authorization. For v3.x APIs, profiles are not required.'
