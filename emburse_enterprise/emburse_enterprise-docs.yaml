  - API keys are required to access REST API resources. Ensure you are using an API
    key that matches the environment in which it was issued. A 401 Unauthorized error
    typically indicates either insufficient access to the specific API resource or
    a mismatched API key for the environment.
- information_source; https://help.chromeriver.com/hc/en-us/articles/37656010951693-REST-Image-API-Migration-Guide:
  - API Key authentication is required. An admin generates an API key through Admin
    Settings > Security > API Key Management, and the key is used along with a Customer
    Code for authentication. The exact header names, parameter names, and how to send
    these credentials (e.g., in which header or query parameter) are not specified
    in this documentation chunk.
  - 'The API uses three required custom headers for authentication: x-api-key (a UUID-format
    API key), customerCode (client identifier), and chain-id (environment/chain identifier).
    Send these headers with each request to the invoice API endpoints.'
  - 'The REST API uses header-based stateless authentication. Include three required
    headers with each request: x-api-key set to your API key, customerCode set to
    your customer code, and chain-id set to your chain ID. Also include Content-Type
    header set to application/json.'
