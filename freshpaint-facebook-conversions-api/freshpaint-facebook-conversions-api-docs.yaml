notes:
- Supports forwarding from the Google Tag Manager Integration
- If you've configured multiple Pixel IDs, you can choose a specific one by suffixing
  the Pixel ID.
- HIPAA customers should use only Facebook Conversions API to remain HIPAA compliant
- Freshpaint’s default state doesn’t share anything at all.
- Freshpaint’s unique opt-in approach is the safest way to prevent inadvertently sharing
  protected health information with marketing tools that aren’t HIPAA-compliant.
- HIPAA mode is a feature that Freshpaint provides to give customers full control
  over what Protected Health Information (PHI) is sent to their destinations.
- The Enforced Allowlists feature allows you to send properties classified as PHI
  to your HIPAA-compliant destinations, and send only non-PHI properties to non-HIPAA
  compliant destinations.
- You may want to send events to a non-HIPAA compliant destination without applying
  ID Masking or Allowlists.
- It's important to understand exactly what metadata and properties a destination
  collects, and whether these metadata and properties contain PII or health information.
- Property values are limited to 255 characters.
- Dynamic Properties are not retroactive at this time
- The visual tagger is recommended for non-technical users.
- Defining events through Liveview is recommended for quick setup.
- 'Go to the URL below to see how to find your Freshpaint Environment ID: https://documentation.freshpaint.io/reference/faqs/where-do-i-find-my-environment-id'
- Participate in the Analytics Beta by contacting support@freshpaint.io
- Freshpaint offers a HIPAA-compliant translation widget giving customers access to
  74 supported languages.
- Freshpaint is working with your marketing and compliance teams to help with your
  organization's HIPAA compliance.
- Server-side GTM is not supported, but Freshpaint can help you migrate from Server-side
  GTM to Freshpaint tags on Client-side GTM.
- Using the Freshpaint GTM Template and the Google Tag Manager Destination at the
  same time is not currently supported.
- Videos that have just been uploaded will initially be in the 'processing' state
  while Freshpaint encodes the video and prepares it for use in web streaming.
- No throttling on request rate limits.
- The impression pixel currently supports IP Matching and Cookie Matching.
- When building lookalike audiences, always exclude the original audience you’re basing
  the lookalike on.
- Freshpaint supports several targeting techniques that can be used individually or
  in combination, depending on your campaign goals.
- Avoid using any language that could imply health conditions, procedures, or patient
  information.
- Ad platforms like Google and Meta prohibit targeting users based on sensitive health
  information.
- Avoid health context in the alias name
- Name, description, and labels stay in Freshpaint
- Audience integrations require identifiers to match individuals from your Freshpaint
  Audience within the Ad Platform.
- Matching is probabilistic, not deterministic — expect a 30–40% match rate.
- You must have the Admin or Data Manager role within your Freshpaint account to allowlist
  these identifiers.
- By default identity matching is off, you will need to enable Identity Matching to
  use segmentation with many integrations.
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for Freshpaint Audiences
- It takes 2 minutes for the Freshpaint CDN to clear.
- After toggling a new destination, it can take up to 2 minutes before the destination
  starts showing up on your website.
- Transformations can be used to modify data before sending to destinations.
- Real-time monitoring for event validation and debugging is available.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Installing the Freshpaint Javascript SDK to the production website has to be done
  by an engineer.
- Once installed (either locally or on production), a non-technical user can use Autotrack
  within the Web source to control and manage data without assistance from a technical
  user.
- For features like Freshpaint Tag Manager or Dynamic Event Properties, add 'unsafe-eval'
  to CSP.
- 'The following urls will need to be allowlisted on your CSP in order to load the
  Freshpaint snippet: https://perfalytics.com/static/js/freshpaint.js, https://perfalytics.com/static/js/integrations.js,
  https://perfalytics.com/static/js/editor.js'
- 'script-src: https://freshpaint-cdn.com, https://perfalytics.com'
- 'script-src-elem: https://freshpaint-cdn.com, https://perfalytics.com'
- 'connect-src: https://*.perfalytics.com, https://perfalytics.com'
- Using 'unsafe-eval' in a Content Security Policy (CSP) allows the execution of arbitrary
  JavaScript code, increasing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- If you are not using React, you can skip to the next part of the quickstart guide.
- The data we autocapture is based on the current state of the elements on your webpage.
- If you configure Google Analytics 4 Proxy through Freshpaint at the same time you
  have it installed directly on your site, your Google Analytics account will start
  counting every user twice.
- If you are using a client-side integration, by default the only data sent to a destinations
  is the same data that is natively collected by the destination.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token.
- Uses OAuth2 with header authorization
- Time machine for warehouses is enabled automatically.
- Backfill feature allows sending historical event data to destinations.
- Next.js requires a unique id attribute on any Script component that does NOT use
  the src attribute.
- The Freshpaint Android SDK does not support autotrack.
- Next.js requires a unique id attribute on Script components that do not use the
  src attribute.
- The Freshpaint iOS SDK does not support autotrack. That means you will have to instrument
  any events you want to track with precision tracking.
- The Freshpaint Android SDK does not support autotrack. That means you will have
  to instrument any events you want to track with precision tracking.
- Send advertising events directly to Basis Technologies
- Ensure that the Enable cookieless conversion checkbox is checked.
- Configuring the impression pixel does not require sharing an IP address or Cookie
  with Basis.
- The Freshpaint React Native SDK supports autotrack.
- You can create new events through the Freshpaint UI.
- Supports HIPAA mode

  allowlist.
- At least one form of matching must be enabled for Impression Pixel configuration.
- The connected user profile must have permission to 'Insert Offline Conversions'
  in Google Campaign Manager 360 for the destination to work.

  send your user data via Freshpaint.
- If two event/table or event property/column names normalize to the same value, only
  one of these will be synced.
- The Google Ads Conversion API requires setting up new Conversion Actions within
  Google Ads.

  are received properly by TikTok.
- To avoid sending PHI to a non-HIPAA compliant destination, you must restrict PII,
  health information, or both.
- When determining whether a destination may collect PHI, it's important to understand
  exactly what metadata and properties a destination collects.
- Facebook Events are case-sensitive
- Freshpaint provides several features to restrict and manage Protected Health Information
  (PHI) in your customer data.
- Freshpaint allows you to configure explicit lists of properties, called allowlists,
