auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.hypo.at/live-psd2-oauth-flow:
  - 'OAuth2 Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain an access token via OAuth2
    authorization code flow using client_id and client_secret with scope "apic-psd2",
    then include the token in the "Authorization: Bearer" header for all API requests
    to psd2.hypo.at. The token response includes access_token, token_type "Bearer",
    and expires_in (seconds). Additionally, X-Request-ID, Consent-ID, and Cache-Control
    headers are required, and client certificate authentication (cert.pem and key.key
    files) via mTLS is also needed.'
  - This API uses mutual TLS (mTLS) certificate-based authentication combined with
    OAuth2 client credentials flow. First, register via POST to obtain a clientId
    using client certificate and key files. Then exchange the clientId for an OAuth
    access token by POSTing to the SSO endpoint with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id, and scope=apic-psd2, again using the same certificate and key files.
    The token request requires Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded and
    returns an access token for subsequent API calls.
- information_source; https://developer.hypo.at/sandbox-oauth-flow:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {token}". Additionally, include the Consent-ID header with a
    consent identifier value for PSD2 compliance.
  - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow is used. Send a POST request to https://sso.hypo.at/
    with Basic Authorization header containing Base64-encoded ClientId:ClientSecret
    credentials to obtain an access token.
  - 'OAuth2 with client credentials grant type. Exchange base64-encoded client credentials
    (Authorization: Basic header) for an access token at https://sso.hypo.at/as/token.oauth2
    using grant_type=client_credentials and scope=apic-sbx-psd2. Use the returned
    access_token value in subsequent API requests via Authorization: Bearer header.'
