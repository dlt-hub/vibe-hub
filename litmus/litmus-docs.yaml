auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.litmus.com/instant:
  - 'The API supports two authentication methods: API key authentication using HTTP
    Basic Auth (with the API key as username and empty password via the -u flag),
    or OAuth2 Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer $TOKEN".
    For OAuth, you must implement the OAuth2 flow to obtain tokens from litmus.com
    on behalf of end users, then include the token in requests via the Authorization
    header with format "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN".'
  - 'The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {token}" where the token is a 64-character hex
    string provided by the service.'
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with an API key. Include the API key in
    the Authorization header using the format `-u "$API_KEY:"` (Basic auth with the
    API key as username and empty password). The end_user_id is passed as a field
    in the JSON request body to associate emails with a unique user identifier.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Include an Authorization header with the
    value "Basic" followed by base64-encoded credentials (typically username:password)
    for all requests to the instant-api.litmus.com endpoint.
  - 'Your application''s API key is used for server-to-server authentication via HTTP
    Basic Auth. Send the API key as the username with an empty password in the Authorization
    header using the Basic scheme, formatted as Authorization: Basic base64(API_KEY:).'
