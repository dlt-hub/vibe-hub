notes:
- Daton offers a variety of pricing plans to fit the needs of businesses of all sizes.
- Free 14-day trial to test out the platform
- You are required to provide this API key while integrating Freshdesk on Daton.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses basic authentication with email and password
- Daton requires READ permissions to your data sources.
- Daton requires the CREATE and MANAGE permissions for destinations.
- Daton will require access permissions both for extracting data from data sources
  and for loading data to cloud based data warehouses and data lakes. As a generic
  rule, Daton would need read access to data sources and write access to data destinations.
- Scopes will be pre-defined as Read-Only for most of the OAuth sources such as Facebook
  Ads, Google Analytics, etc. Users can verify the scopes during authentication on
  Daton.

- 'Token Expiration: Users may need to intervene if Daton cannot retrieve a new token.'
- 'API Key Expiration: Users must provide a valid API key if the current key becomes
  invalid.'
- 'User Losing Access to Sources: Creating a dedicated user for data access is recommended
  to avoid interruption.'
- 'Database Connection Errors: Changes in whitelisting or credentials can disrupt
  connections.'
- 'Breaching Rate Limits: Daton is designed to handle rate limiting from sources.'
