auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.btcsquare.net/:
  - 'API key and secret are required for authentication. Requests must include three
    headers: X-API-KEY containing your API key, X-SIGNATURE containing an HMAC-SHA256
    signature of the request, and X-TIMESTAMP containing the current Unix timestamp
    in milliseconds. The signature is computed from a concatenation of timestamp,
    HTTP method, request path, and request body (if present).'
  - 'BTCsquare API uses HMAC-SHA512 signature-based authentication. Include three
    headers in every request: X-BTCSQUARE-API-KEY (your API key), X-BTCSQUARE-API-TIMESTAMP
    (current microtime in milliseconds), and X-BTCSQUARE-API-SIGN (HMAC-SHA512 signature).
    The signature is generated by base64-encoding an HMAC-SHA512 hash of the concatenated
    string path + timestamp + HTTP method + request body, using your API secret as
    the key.'
  - The API requires three headers with every request. X-BTCSQUARE-API-KEY is your
    API key generated after logging in to BTCSquare.net. X-BTCSQUARE-API-SIGN is an
    HMAC-SHA256 signature computed from the string {path+timestamp+method+body}, where
    path is the endpoint (e.g. /v2/order), timestamp is the current Unix millisecond
    timestamp, method is GET/POST/DELETE, and body is the JSON request body. X-BTCSQUARE-API-TIMESTAMP
    is the current timestamp for your request. All three headers must be included
    in every API request.
  - Users must register with BTCsquare.net and generate API keys and secrets from
    the My Account > Trading API section. Each API key can have custom access rights
    (R1 for read orders/trades/balances, R2 for place/modify/cancel orders, R3 for
    payment info, R4 for cryptocurrency withdrawals). The API is rate-limited to 30
    requests per second per user account.
- information_source; https://api.btcsquare.net:
  - 'API keys and secrets must be generated by registered users in the My Account
    > Trading API section of BTCsquare.net. Each key can have custom access permissions:
    R1 for viewing orders/trades/balances, R2 for placing/modifying/canceling orders,
    R3 for payment information and withdrawal previews, and R4 for cryptocurrency
    withdrawals. Rate limiting is 30 requests/second per user account. The documentation
    does not specify the exact header names or parameter names for sending credentials
    in requests.'
