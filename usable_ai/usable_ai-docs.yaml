  - 'APIs can accept credentials via query parameters or HTTP headers. Google APIs
    typically require an API key as a query parameter named key. Other services prefer
    the Authorization header with a bearer token format like "Authorization: Bearer
    YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN". Some APIs may also use custom headers for credentials. The
    Authorization header is the standard approach for OAuth tokens and bearer tokens
    across most API providers.'
  - 'Authorization uses Bearer token authentication. Include the header Authorization:
    Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN in requests to authenticate with the Pinterest API. The
    access token must be provided in the Authorization header with Bearer prefix.'
  - 'RapidAPI requires two custom headers for authentication: x-rapidapi-host (the
    API host identifier) and x-rapidapi-key (your API key). Both headers must be included
    in every HTTP request, or the request will be rejected.'
