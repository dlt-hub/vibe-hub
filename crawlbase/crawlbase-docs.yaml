  - 'The Crawling API uses token-based authentication. Include your API key as a query
    parameter named `token` in the request URL: `?token=API_KEY`. The full endpoint
    format is `https://api.crawlbase.com?token=API_KEY&url=encodedURL`, where the
    API key is your private token required to authenticate all requests.'
- information_source; https://crawlbase.com/blog/store-scraped-data-on-cloud/:
  - All Cloud Storage API requests require passing a user token via the query parameter
    token=USER_TOKEN. The token is sent as a query parameter in all GET and DELETE
    requests to manage stored data, including retrieving pages, checking storage count,
    and deleting items.
  - Authentication uses a private token passed as a query parameter. Send GET requests
    to the storage API endpoint with token=USER_TOKEN in the query string, where USER_TOKEN
    is your private token obtained upon signing up.
- information_source; https://crawlbase.com/docs/crawling-api/parameters/:
  - API authentication uses a query parameter named token set to your USER_TOKEN value.
    Include the token parameter in the request URL query string when making requests
    to the api.crawlbase.com endpoint.
  - API authentication uses a token-based query parameter approach. Include the token
    as a query parameter named `token` with your user token value (e.g., `token=USER_TOKEN`)
    in the request URL to the api.crawlbase.com endpoint.
