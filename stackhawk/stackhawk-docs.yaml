auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.stackhawk.com/apidocs.html:
  - 'Authentication uses bearer tokens sent via the Authorization header. After obtaining
    a token through initial authentication, include it in subsequent requests using
    the `Authorization: Bearer` header format.'
  - 'Use your StackHawk API Key from Settings > API Keys to request an access token
    via GET /api/v1/auth/login with the X-ApiKey header, then use the returned access
    token with the Authorization: Bearer header for subsequent API requests.'
- information_source; https://docs.stackhawk.com/hawkscan/configuration/:
  - HawkScan supports token-based authorization passed via HTTP headers. The token
    is configured with a type (default "HEADER"), a value specifying the header name,
    and a tokenType (default "Bearer") that prefixes the token. For JWT tokens, set
    isJWT to true and optionally configure renewMillis for automatic token refresh.
    Alternatively, custom session management can be implemented via a sessionScript
    with a name and parameters map. Authorization is verified using a testPath that
    specifies an endpoint, HTTP method, request headers/body, and a success regex
    pattern to validate auth is working before scanning.
  - Token-based authentication with optional cookie-based session management. Tokens
    are extracted from authentication responses using a TOKEN_PATH mechanism and passed
    to the application via configured authorization headers or parameters on each
    request. Cookie authorization is also supported as an alternative session maintenance
    method.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.stackhawk.com/apidocs.html:
  - 'Paginated requests use optional path parameters: pageToken (string, starts at
    ''0''), pageSize (number, defaults to 10), sortField (defaults to ''name''), and
    sortDir (''asc'' or ''desc'', defaults ascending). Responses include nextPageToken
    (string for next page) and totalCount (total resources). Use nextPageToken value
    as pageToken in subsequent requests to paginate through results.'
