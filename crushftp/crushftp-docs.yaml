- information_source; https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=APIFileTransfer:
  - 'API authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth or a POST parameter. For HTTP methods
    like MKCOL and DELETE, include the Authorization header with Basic authentication
    credentials in the format "Authorization: Basic" followed by base64-encoded username:password.
    Alternatively, POST requests can include a c2f parameter (appears to be a session
    or authentication token) along with the command and path parameters.'
  - 'CrushFTP supports two authentication methods: (1) POST-based login with command=login&username=user&password=pass&encoded=true
    to obtain a CrushAuth cookie token for session tracking, or (2) HTTP Basic authentication
    using the Authorization header with BASE64 encoded credentials in format Authorization:
    Basic <base64(username:password)>. The Basic auth method cannot be tracked to
    a single session. For file operations (GET/PUT/MOVE/POST), include the Authorization:
    Basic header with BASE64 encoded username:password.'
  - 'The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header with the format "Basic" followed by base64-encoded username:password (e.g.,
    "Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l"). Additionally, a "c2f" parameter
    appears to be used in POST requests, though its exact authentication purpose is
    not clearly documented in this excerpt.'
- information_source; https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=CrushOIDC:
  - OAuth2 and OpenID Connect configuration endpoints are listed for multiple identity
    providers (Apple, Google, Microsoft Azure AD/B2C, Amazon Cognito, Okta, Auth0,
    Dropbox). For providers not supporting OpenID Connect but supporting OAuth2 (like
    Box), a local JSON configuration file can be used instead, which must contain
    the authorization_endpoint (required) and optionally token_endpoint fields.
- information_source; https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=GDriveSetup:
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication with Google Drive REST API v3. Users must
    grant consent for secure access to their Google Drive data through the OAuth 2.0
    flow, which handles credential management and authorization.
