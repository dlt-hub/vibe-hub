auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.buda.com/:
  - 'Buda.com uses API-KEY and API-SECRET authentication for private routes. Generate
    an API-KEY and API-SECRET from the account settings at https://www.buda.com/manejar_api_keys.
    Never share your API-SECRET.


    To authenticate, sign all private requests by creating a nonce (integer, must
    be greater than the previous nonce; timestamp is recommended), then generate a
    signature string with the format "{METHOD} {path} {base64_encoded_body} {nonce}"
    where path includes query string but not host, base64_encoded_body is the request
    body encoded in Base64 (empty for GET requests), and nonce is the integer. The
    signature is computed from this string using your API-SECRET (the documentation
    cuts off but indicates HMAC is used based on context). Send the API-KEY, nonce,
    and signature in request headers when calling private routes.'
  - HMAC authentication is required. Use the BudaHMACAuth class with api_key and secret
    parameters passed to the auth argument in requests library calls. The authentication
    mechanism is implemented as a custom auth handler that signs requests with HMAC.
  - The API uses HMAC authentication. Credentials are passed via a BudaHMACAuth object
    initialized with api_key and secret parameters, which is then supplied to the
    auth argument in requests.post() calls. The HMAC auth scheme signs requests to
    authenticate cryptocurrency withdrawal and address operations.
  - 'The API uses HMAC-SHA384 authentication. Generate an HMAC signature by hashing
    a string (containing the HTTP method, endpoint, nonce, and payload) with your
    API-SECRET, encode it as hexadecimal, then include three headers in your request:
    X-SBTC-APIKEY (your API key), X-SBTC-NONCE (a unique timestamp), and X-SBTC-SIGNATURE
    (the generated HMAC signature).'
  - The API uses OAuth for secure and standardized authorization. OAuth allows users
    to securely authorize third-party applications to access their data without sharing
    full credentials. For additional details, contact api.support@buda.com.
pagination_info:

  - "Esta llamada usa paginaci\xF3n. Consulta la secci\xF3n de paginaci\xF3n en la\
    \ documentaci\xF3n para detalles sobre c\xF3mo paginar resultados en el endpoint\
    \ GET /markets/<market_id>/orders."
  - 'Pagination uses optional URL parameters: timestamp (Unix time, optional) to specify
    a starting point, and limit (optional) to control the number of trades returned
    per request. The response includes a timestamp field indicating the data''s reference
    time; use this value as the timestamp parameter in subsequent requests to fetch
    earlier trades.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters per (default 20, max 300) and page (default 1).
    Responses include a meta object with total_pages, total_count, and current_page
    fields. Iterate from page 1 to total_pages to retrieve all results, preferably
    with per set to 300 for efficiency.
  - Use the query parameter `page` to request specific pages. The response includes
    a `pagination` object with fields `current_page`, `total_pages`, `per_page`, and
    `total_count` to indicate pagination state and construct subsequent requests.
- information_source; https://api.buda.com/en/:
  - Pagination uses a page-based scheme with `page` parameter (starting at 1) and
    `page_size` up to 300. The response includes a `meta` object with `total_pages`,
    `total_count`, and `current_page` fields to track pagination state and determine
    when to stop iterating.
