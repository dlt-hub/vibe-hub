notes:
- Files are added with a URL from where Cloudprinter can fetch the files when the
  order has been accepted.
- A TLS encrypted HTTPS connection, use of an access key in the query string and use
  of a network access control list is recommended.
- Orders are not pushed to any printer, but otherwise processed the same way in the
  Cloudprinter.com system.
- Printer signals are generated to simulate that the order was printed and shipped.
- Sandbox orders are free.
- This spine width calculation uses average bulk values.
- The characteristics of the paper used by different print partners may vary.
- The price check supports multi-currency. Default currency is EUR.
