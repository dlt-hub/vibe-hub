auth_info:
- information_source; https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/:
  - API key authentication accepts a key-value pair sent either in request headers
    or query parameters. Bearer token authentication uses an access token (such as
    JWT) included in the Authorization header with the format "Bearer <token>". JWT
    bearer authentication generates and adds JWT tokens to requests, which can be
    placed in either the request header or query parameters.
- information_source; https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-10/:
  - OAuth 1.0 authentication is supported with two or three-legged flows. The consumer
    application requests an access token using a key and secret, receives a temporary
    token, requests user authorization, exchanges the temporary token for an access
    token upon user grant, and then uses the access token to access user data from
    the service provider. Signature methods supported include HMAC, PLAINTEXT, and
    RSA. Authorization details can be passed in request headers, body, or URL. Required
    fields depend on the signature method selected.
  - OAuth 1.0 authentication with configurable signature methods. Send authorization
    data in request headers (as Authorization header with OAuth prefix and comma-separated
    details) or in request body/URL parameters depending on request method. For HMAC
    or PLAINTEXT signatures, provide Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token,
    and Token Secret. For RSA signatures, provide Consumer Key and Access Token.

  : - Guided Auth supports bearer, basic, API key, and OAuth 2.0 authentication credentials.
      For OAuth 2.0, Postman automatically refreshes tokens stored in the Postman
      Vault. Credentials are added through the Authorization tab by selecting the
      appropriate auth type from the recommended setup options, and vault secrets
      are deleted upon signing out of Postman.

  - Postman API authentication uses an API key passed as a query parameter. Generate
    a Postman API key from the Postman dashboard, then include it in requests to the
    Postman API by appending `?apikey=postman-api-key` to the URL, such as in `https://api.getpostman.com/collections/collection-id?apikey=postman-api-key`.
