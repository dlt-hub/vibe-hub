auth_info:
- information_source; https://admin.nearkey.io/docs/api-rest.html:
  - The API uses a secret token passed as a query parameter named `token` for authentication.
    This token is shown in the app settings and must be included in requests to the
    `/shoot` endpoint.
  - The API uses token-based authentication. To authenticate, call POST /login with
    email, device_id, device_desc, and recaptcha token to receive an auth token. The
    token must be activated by clicking a link in a received email, then use this
    token for subsequent API requests.
  - 'To test endpoints that need authentication, generate an auth token by calling
    /login and validating it via email. Then pass the token in the Authorization header
    as "Authorization: TOKEN your-token-here".'
- information_source; https://admin.nearkey.io/docs/quickstart.html:
  - API tokens are created via POST request to https://api.nearkey.io/login with JSON
    body containing email, device_id (must start with "api-"), and device_desc. The
    device_id parameter serves as the API token identifier. The response returns a
    JSON object with an API token that should be used for subsequent API requests.
    Exact header names and how to send the token in requests are not specified in
    this excerpt.
  - 'Authentication uses a custom TOKEN scheme. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Authorization: TOKEN xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" where xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is
    replaced with your actual API token. This token must be provided for all authenticated
    requests to the API.'
