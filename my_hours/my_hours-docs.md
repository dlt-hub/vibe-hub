In this guide, we'll set up a complete My Hours data pipeline from API credentials to your first data load in just 10 minutes. You'll end up with a fully declarative Python pipeline based on dlt's REST API connector.

```python-outcome
import dlt
from dlt.sources.rest_api import (
    RESTAPIConfig,
    rest_api_resources,
)

@dlt.source
def my_hours_source(access_token=dlt.secrets.value):
    config: RESTAPIConfig = {
        "client": {
            "base_url": "https://myhours.com/api/",
            "auth": {
                "type": "bearer",
                "token": access_token,
            },
        },
        "resources": [
            "time_logs",
            "clients",
            "projects"
            ],
    }

    yield from rest_api_resources(config)


def get_data() -> None:
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name='my_hours_pipeline',
        destination='duckdb',
        dataset_name='my_hours_data', 
    )
    access_token = "my_access_token"
    load_info = pipeline.run(my_hours_source(access_token))
    print(load_info)  # noqa
```

### Why use dlt for this?

- dlt is fully declarative, while being python-native and enabling imperative customization
- Offers schema evolution with type inference for resilient, low maintenance pipelines
- Performance and scalability control
- Shallow learning curve - the pipeline is easy to extend by any team member
- dlt is the tool of choice for Pythonic Iceberg Lakehouses

## What you‚Äôll do

We‚Äôll show you how to generate a readable and easily maintainable Python script that fetches data from my_hours‚Äôs API and loads it into Iceberg, DataFrames, files, or a database of your choice. Here are some of the endpoints you can load:

- Time Management: Access and manage time logs, projects, and clients.
- Team Management: Retrieve information about team members and manage tags associated with time logs.

You can combine these endpoints to build pipelines that extract structured content from My Hours workspaces at scale ‚Äî via REST APIs or webhook ingestion.

## Setup & steps to follow

```default
Before getting started, let's make sure Cursor is set up correctly:
   - Use a model like Claude 3.7 Sonnet or better
   - Add the specification file **@my_hours-docs.yaml** as context
   - Index the REST API Source tutorial: https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/rest_api/ and add it to context as **@dlt rest api**
   - [Read our full steps on setting up Cursor](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/llm-tooling/cursor-restapi#23-configuring-cursor-with-documentation)
```

Now you're ready to get started! 

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute these commands in a new Cursor shell.**
    
    Install dlt with duckdb support:
    ```shell
    pip install dlt
    ```

    Initialize a dlt pipeline with My Hours support.
    ```shell
    dlt init dlthub:my_hours duckdb
    ```

    The `init` command will setup some important files and folders, including `requirements.txt`. Install the requirements for the rest of the project.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. ü§† **Start vibe-coding**
    
    Here‚Äôs a nice prompt for you to start: 
    
    ```prompt
    Please generate a REST API Source for My Hours API, as specified in @my_hours-docs.yaml 
    Start with endpoints "time_logs" and "clients" and skip incremental loading for now. 
    Place the code in my_hours_pipeline.py and name the pipeline my_hours_pipeline. 
    If the file exists, use it as a starting point. 
    Do not add or modify any other files. 
    Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial. 
    After adding the endpoints, allow the user to run the pipeline with python my_hours_pipeline.py and await further instructions.
    ```

    
3. üîí **Setup credentials** 
    
    Authentication is managed via OAuth2 with a refresh token flow. Credentials must be from an admin My Hours account. The token URL for refreshing the access token is 'https://myhours.com/oauth/token'.
    
    To get appropriate API keys, please visit the original source at https://www.myhours.com/.
    If you want to protect your environment secrets in a production environment, look into [setting up credentials with dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add_credentials).
    
4. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Run the pipeline in the Python terminal in Cursor**
    
    ```shell
    python my_hours_pipeline.py
    ```
    
    If your pipeline runs correctly you‚Äôll see something like the following:
    
    ```shell
    Pipeline my_hours load step completed in 0.26 seconds
    1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset my_hours_data
    The duckdb destination used duckdb:/my_hours.duckdb location to store data
    Load package 1749667187.541553 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
    ```
    
5. üìà **See data**
    
    ```shell
    dlt pipeline my_hours_pipeline show --marimo
    ```
    
6. üêç **Get your data in Python**
    
    ```python
    import dlt

   data = dlt.pipeline("my_hours_pipeline").dataset()
   # get time_logs table as Pandas frame
   data.time_logs.df().head()
    ```

## Running into errors?

Requires admin level My Hours account for access. Ensure correct credentials and admin access to avoid 401 errors. Be cautious of the rate limits to prevent 429 errors and consider implementing exponential backoff for retry mechanisms. Adjust pagination settings as needed for the volume of time logs.
