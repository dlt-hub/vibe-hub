  - 'API key authentication is required. Submit your unique gateway API key with each
    request (exact header name and submission method not specified in provided text).
    Invalid or missing API keys will return a 401 Unauthorized response with errorMessage
    "API security error: API key check failed." and fault details in rootCause.'
  - Gateway authentication requires including a globally unique API key with each
    request. The API key is issued upon successful access request and is tied to your
    security account and BC Registries Account ID. The API key must have permission
    to access the specific API being requested, with more granular authorization managed
    by security roles associated with your SBC Connect account ID. You will receive
    instructions on how to request, replace, and maintain your API key for your gateway
    environment.
- information_source; https://developer.api.bcregistry.gov.bc.ca/en-CA/products/get-started/apis-summary:
  - API key authentication is required for all requests. Each API key is globally
    unique, tied to a security account, and must be included with every request. The
    API key must have permission to access the specific API being called. More granular
    authorization for Registries is managed by security roles associated with your
    SBC Connect account ID, which is linked to your security account and API key.
    API keys can be requested, replaced, and maintained through the access request
    process.
  - The API uses an API key for authentication. The API key is issued upon successful
    completion of an access request and is globally unique and tied to your security
    account. Authentication failures return a 401 Unauthorized status with an error
    message indicating "API key check failed" and an oauth.v2.InvalidApiKey error
    code. The exact mechanism for submitting the API key (header name, query parameter,
    or request body field) is not specified in the provided documentation.
- information_source; https://developer.api.bcregistry.gov.bc.ca/en-CA/products/mhr/overview:
  - All requests must include a BC Registries issued API key and an Account ID. The
    API key should be set in the session via the AUTHORIZE button in the API interface
    by entering the key value under API Key Auth, or it can be submitted with each
    request. Both the API key and Account ID are required credentials obtained through
    the account setup process.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.api.bcregistry.gov.bc.ca/en-CA/products/ppr/overview:
  - If the number of Financing Statements in search results exceeds 75 and the request
    format is application/pdf, report creation is asynchronous and requires a callbackURL
    request parameter. A notification is sent to the callback URL with an id and getReportURL,
    which can be used in a GET request to retrieve the report.
