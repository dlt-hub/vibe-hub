- openGauss cannot monitor file permissions and slow disks. When the file permission
  is abnormal, the database exits and the corresponding information is recorded in
  logs. On a slow disk, the response to database operations is slower than usual.
- The read-only mode of the standby node and cascaded standby node is incompatible
  with the ultimate RTO feature. If the ultimate RTO feature is enabled, disable the
  read-only mode of the standby node and cascaded standby node.
- Memory Optimized Tables (MOTs) are incompatible with the incremental checkpoint
  feature. If MOTs are used, disable the incremental checkpoint function.
- LLVM does not support the Arm architecture. When the MOT TPC-C is imported, an LLVM
  error is reported. To avoid this problem, disable the JIT function using the enable_mot_codegen
  parameter. You can configure force_mot_pseudo_codegen= true to reduce the impact
  on TPC-C test performance when the JIT function is disabled.
- Ensure that the IP address types of the primary and standby nodes are the same.
- If the installation stops abnormally, check whether the installation directory and
  data directory meet the expected requirements.
- 'The name of a database object must meet the following requirements: The name of
  a non-time series table ranges from 1 to 63 bytes and that of a time series table
  ranges from 1 to 53 characters.'
- The current database ODBC driver is based on an open-source version and may be incompatible
  with data types tinyint, smalldatetime, and nvarchar2.
- This function establishes a new database connection using the parameters taken from
  the string conninfo.
- If the server connection attempt fails (as indicated by PQstatus), the application
  should call PQfinish to release the memory used by the PGconn object.
- The PGconn pointer must not be used again after PQfinish has been called.
- This function is applicable to fault recovery after a connection exception occurs.
- The connection status can be one of the preceding values. After the asynchronous
  connection procedure is complete, only two of them, CONNECTION_OK and CONNECTION_BAD,
  can return.
- Client applications that use these functions must include the header file libpq/libpq-fs.h
  and link with the libpq library.
- Large object manipulation using these functions must take place within an SQL transaction
  block.
- To prevent password leakage, when running CREATE USER/ROLE to create a database
  user, do not specify the UNENCRYPTED attribute.
- Considering the usage and service continuity of a database, the database still allows
  a user to log in after the password expires.
errors:
- 'CONNECTION_BAD: Failed connection.'
- 'CONNECTION_OK: Normal connection.'
- Function will return an otherwise-impossible value, typically 0 or -1 if an error
  occurs.
