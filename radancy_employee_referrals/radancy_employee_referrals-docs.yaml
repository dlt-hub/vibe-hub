auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.1brd.com/:
  - Bearer Token authentication is used for SCIM API requests. To obtain the token,
    create an API key in the Employee Referrals application's Integrations tab. Alternatively,
    acquire an OAuth token by sending a POST request to https://auth.1brd.com/oauth/token
    with Base64-encoded ClientId and Client Secret in the Authorization header using
    Basic auth scheme, then use the returned access_token value. Include the Bearer
    Token in the Authorization header of subsequent SCIM API requests to https://customer.services.1brd.com/api/customers/{COMPANY
    ID}/scim/v2/. The COMPANY ID is found in the Company ID Information section of
    the account preferences, Integrations tab, under API Key Management. OAuth token
    response includes access_token, expires_in (in seconds), and scope fields (read
    write).
  - Bearer token authentication is required for SCIM provisioning requests. Include
    the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}" when making requests
    to the SCIM endpoint at https://customer.services.1brd.com/api/customers/{COMPANY
    ID}/scim/v2/.
  - Bearer token authentication. Obtain an access token using your API key and secret,
    then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer youraccesstoken" for all
    subsequent requests to /v1/ endpoints.
  - The Employee Referrals API uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow. To authenticate,
    a Company Administrator must generate an API key and API secret from account settings.
    Send a POST request to https://auth.1brd.com/oauth/token with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
    grant_type=client_credentials, scope=read%20write, and an Authorization header
    containing Basic {base64(apikey:apisecret)}. The response includes an access_token
    with token_type bearer. Use this access_token in subsequent API requests to authenticate.
  - 'Webhook endpoints may optionally be secured using Basic Authentication or OAuth
    2.0 client credentials flow. Webhooks are sent as POST requests with JSON arrays
    to your configured URL, and you can restrict acceptance to specific IP addresses:
    52.57.76.133 and 52.57.83.207.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.1brd.com/:
  - Paginated responses use offset-based pagination with query parameters offset and
    limit to control the page position and size. The response includes an items array
    containing the collection elements, and pagination metadata fields such as href,
    offset, limit, and total to indicate the current page state and total count. Stop
    paginating when the number of returned items is less than the requested limit
    or when offset plus limit exceeds total.
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. limit controls the number of
    results per request, and offset specifies the starting position. Refer to Pagination
    documentation for specific details on default values, maximum limits, and response
    structure.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters for requests. Responses include
    total for the total count, offset and limit for the current pagination state,
    and first, next, and last fields containing URLs to navigate between pages.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. The response includes an href
    field with the full paginated URL, and a total field indicating total results.
    Use offset to navigate through pages by incrementing it based on the limit value.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset specifies the starting
    position (default 0) and limit specifies the number of items per page (default
    25 based on example). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing offset by
    the limit value until fewer items than limit are returned.
