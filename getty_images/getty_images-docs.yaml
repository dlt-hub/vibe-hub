auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.gettyimages.com/docs/:
  - A valid Api-Key header and access token are required. The Api-Key should be sent
    as an HTTP header named "Api-Key" with your API key value. The access token must
    also be provided, though the specific header or parameter name for the token is
    not explicitly stated in this excerpt.
  - 'API requests require two authentication headers: Api-Key header with your API
    key value, and Authorization header with Bearer token containing an access token.
    Both credentials must be provided together in the request.


    Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>

    Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
  - 'All requests to the Getty Images API require an `api-key` header. Additionally,
    elevated privileges require an access token obtained via OAuth2 client credentials
    grant, sent as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.


    Required headers: `api-key` header with your API key value. Optional but recommended:
    `Authorization` header with format `Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` for elevated privileges.


    To obtain an access token, make a POST request to `https://authentication.gettyimages.com/oauth2/token`
    with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and body parameters: `client_id=<API_KEY>`,
    `client_secret=<API_SECRET>`, and `grant_type=client_credentials`. The response
    contains the access token to use in subsequent API requests.'
  - Clients using the `download_sizes` or `largest_downloads` arguments must provide
    an access token. The `accept-language` header can be used to request localized
    responses in supported languages, though this is not authentication-related. An
    `api-` header is mentioned but appears incomplete in the documentation.
  - Getty Images API uses API key authentication. The `api-key` header is required
    for all requests and must contain your API key value. Additionally, the `gi-country-code`
    header can be sent to override automatic end-user location detection, though not
    all API customers have access to this feature.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.gettyimages.com/docs/:
  - Pagination is controlled by `page` and `page_size` query parameters. `page` defaults
    to 1, and `page_size` defaults to 30 for search results with valid values of 1,
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 100. Use the `result_count`
    property in responses to calculate available pages.
  - Use the query parameter page to request specific pages of search results. The
    API returns a 400 Bad Request error if the page number exceeds the total number
    of pages available, with an error response indicating the maximum allowed page
    value and total results count.
