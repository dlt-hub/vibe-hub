pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.clearbooks.co.uk:
  - Paginated endpoints accept a `limit` query parameter (up to 200 maximum) to specify
    results per page and a `page` query parameter to select the page number. Responses
    include headers X-Pagination-Limit, X-Pagination-Current-Page, X-Pagination-Total-Pages,
    and X-Pagination-Total-Count to indicate pagination state and total available
    results.
  - Pagination uses limit (query parameter, integer, range 1 to some maximum) and
    page (query parameter, integer, default >= 1) to request paginated supplier data.
    The response structure for pagination fields is not shown in this excerpt.
  - Pagination uses limit and page query parameters. limit is an integer between 1
    and a maximum value, and page is an integer with default value 1. Use these parameters
    to request specific pages of sales documents.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters limit (integer, range 1 to unspecified
    maximum) and page (integer, default >= 1) to control results. The response is
    an array of attachment objects; use page increments to retrieve subsequent pages
    until no more results are returned.
  - Pagination uses query parameters limit (integer, 1-500 range) and page (integer,
    >= 1, default 1) to control page size and page number respectively for the list
    purchases endpoint.
