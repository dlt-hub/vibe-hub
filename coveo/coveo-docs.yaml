auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.coveo.com/en/1525/:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Send the API key in the X-Api-Key header
    with each request. The header name is X-Api-Key and the value is your API key
    string (example: Az4adfSyBhZX8fTThUJ4Kb2TC3Ax0RshgrZtUiqM).'
  - API key authentication is used, passed as a query parameter named api_key. The
    api_key value is provided by the user and included in requests as a query string
    parameter, for example GET /users?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE.
  - 'Authentication uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The API
    key is encrypted in the source configuration and replaced with the placeholder
    @ApiKey at runtime. Coveo sends the request with the header Authorization: Bearer
    [actual_api_key].


    For custom headers like X-Api-Key, the API key is similarly configured in the
    Authentication section and sent as a custom HTTP header in requests.'
  - Authentication with an API key as a query parameter is required. Enter the API
    key in the Authentication section of the Add a REST API source panel, then use
    the @ApiKey placeholder in the source JSON configuration. When processed, Coveo
    replaces @ApiKey with the actual key value and encrypts it. The query parameter
    name is api_key.
  - Authentication with an API key is supported through the Authentication section
    of the REST API source panel. The API key should be entered in the Authentication
    section, then referenced in the source JSON configuration using the @ApiKey placeholder.
    When Coveo processes the configuration, it replaces the @ApiKey placeholder with
    the actual encrypted key value, ensuring credentials are not stored in clear text.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.coveo.com/en/1525/:
  - Offset-based pagination uses query parameters limit (page size) and start (offset
    position, default 0), incrementing start by the limit value for each subsequent
    page. URL-based pagination uses a nextPage field in the JSON response containing
    the complete URL for the next page, which is used directly in the subsequent request
    until no nextPage is returned.
  - Page-based pagination uses OffsetType "page" with OffsetStart and PageSize properties,
    incrementing a page number parameter per request. Offset-based pagination uses
    OffsetType "item" with OffsetStart and PageSize, incrementing an offset parameter
    by PageSize. URL-based and cursor-based pagination use OffsetType "url" or "cursor"
    respectively, with PageSize and NextPageKey properties to construct subsequent
    requests.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach with a Paging object containing PageSize
    (required, number of items per page), NextPageKey (string identifying the pagination
    token in responses), and OffsetType set to "cursor". The UsePayloadTokens parameter
    indicates whether pagination tokens come from the response payload. Move to the
    next page by extracting the NextPageKey value from the current response and using
    it in the subsequent request.
  - Pagination uses offset-based or page-based navigation. Configure `OffsetType`
    as "page" or "offset", set `PageSize` for results per page, and use `Offset` parameter
    name in query string. Set `FetchNextPageUntilNoResult` to true to fetch until
    no results return, or alternatively use `TotalCountHeaderKey` or `TotalCountKey`
    to determine total pages.
  - 'Pagination uses offset-based parameters in the query string: the `Offset` parameter
    specifies the query field name (e.g., "position"), and `OffsetStart` indicates
    the starting index value. For POST requests with payload tokens, use `UsePayloadTokens`
    to omit `Limit` and `Offset` from the query URL and instead pass a token (e.g.,
    `nextPageId`) from the response in the request payload to fetch the next page.'
