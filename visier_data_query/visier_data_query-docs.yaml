auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.visier.com/developer/Studio/data/data connectors/data-connectors.htm:
  - Data connectors authenticate to source systems using service account credentials
    stored in an encrypted secret store. The specific authentication requirements
    vary by source system and may include REST API authentication over HTTPS, JDBC
    database connections, SOAP, or GraphQL APIs, with permissions controlled by the
    service account's access level in the source system.
- information_source; https://docs.visier.com/developer/Studio/data/data connectors/databricks/databricks-reqs.htm:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is used for Delta Sharing. The bearer token is passed
    in the Authorization header to authorize access to the share endpoint, with an
    optional expiration time in ISO 8601 format.


    Key details: bearerToken field contains the token value (example: test_token),
    sent as Authorization: Bearer <token> header; endpoint is the Delta Sharing API
    URL (example: https://oregon.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/delta-sharing/.../);
    expirationTime is optional and indicates when the token expires (example: 2025-05-29T22:00:00.000Z);
    shareCredentialsVersion indicates the credential format version (currently 1).'
  - Delta Sharing authentication uses a bearer token provided in a credential file
    generated during the Databricks share setup. The token is supplied as "bearerToken"
    in JSON format and should be used in the Authorization header as a Bearer token
    when making requests to the Delta Sharing endpoint specified in the same credential
    file.
- information_source; https://docs.visier.com/developer/Studio/data/data connectors/workday/workday-reqs.htm:
  - OAuth 2.0 using authorization code grant type with non-expiring refresh token
    is recommended. Provide Domain name (Workday instance URL), client ID, client
    secret, and refresh token in connector credential configuration. For basic auth,
    provide Username and Password. OAuth 2.0 is required for Workday Query Language
    connector support.
- information_source; https://docs.visier.com/developer/Studio/data/data connectors/workday/workday-raas-reqs.htm:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication requires an API client configured in Workday with authorization
    code grant type. Provide client ID, client secret, and a non-expiring refresh
    token. Additionally supply domain name (your Workday instance URL), integration
    user username and password, and implementation name (tenant ID). Optionally provide
    an integration system ID for custom attributes. The refresh token should not expire
    to avoid authentication failures during scheduled Visier jobs.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.visier.com/developer/apis/references/api-reference.htm:
  - Pagination is controlled by query parameters limit (integer, the maximum number
    of results to retrieve) and start (integer, the offset index starting at 0). The
    response includes limit and start fields echoing the request parameters, and connectorCredentials
    array containing the paginated results. To retrieve the next page, increment start
    by the previous limit value and repeat the request.
  - 'Pagination is supported via query parameters: limit (integer, the maximum number
    of results to retrieve) and start (integer, the offset/index to start from, beginning
    at 0). The response includes limit and start fields echoing the request parameters.
    To paginate, increment start by the limit value and repeat the request until fewer
    results than limit are returned.'
  - Pagination is used with the GET endpoint for retrieving committed changes. The
    query parameters limit (default 400) and start (default 0) control pagination,
    where limit specifies the maximum number of results per request and start specifies
    the zero-based index to begin returning results from.
  - Pagination uses a limit query parameter (integer, default 100, maximum 1000) to
    control the maximum number of data access sets returned. When the number of valid
    sets exceeds 100, the response status code is 206; to retrieve more than 100 sets,
    increase the limit parameter value.
  - Pagination uses limit (integer, query parameter) to specify the maximum number
    of analytic tenant details to retrieve, and start (integer, query parameter) as
    the offset index starting from 0. The response includes limit and start fields
    echoing the request parameters.
