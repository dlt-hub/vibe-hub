  - The API key must be passed as a URL query parameter named APPID. After registering
    with openweathermap.org, you receive an API key that is required for all API calls
    to their weather endpoints.

  : - Authorization Bearer Tokens are required and must be passed in the HTTP request
      header. Add the Authorization header with the value formatted as "Bearer <token>"
      in the Default HTTP Request Headers field. The token value should be replaced
      with the actual bearer token provided by the API service. Multiple header tokens
      can be added in the same field using the specified JSON format with the Name
      field set to "Authorization" and the Value field containing "Bearer <your_token>".
    - Replace the Values with the token that needs to be passed in the HTTP Request
      Headers section. Multiple header tokens can be passed. Ensure tokens are formatted
      correctly without line breaks to avoid deserialization errors. The Authorization
      header should contain the bearer token in the proper format. For development
      purposes only, pass the token as a custom HTTP header in the REST Service instance
      configuration, and verify the REST Service API URL does not contain spaces as
      K2RESTBroker may double-encode already-encoded URLs, causing 401 or 404 responses.

  - 'Authorization bearer token needs to be passed in the Authorization header when
    calling REST API services. The token should be included as "Authorization: Bearer
    {token}" in the request headers.'
  - Services use Authorization Bearer Tokens passed in the HTTP Authorization header.
    Add the token in the Default HTTP Request Headers field with the header name "Authorization"
    and value formatted as "Bearer <token>", where <token> is replaced with the actual
    authentication token. Multiple header tokens can be included in the same configuration.
