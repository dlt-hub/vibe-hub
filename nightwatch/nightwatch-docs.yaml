auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.nightwatch.io/:
  - API uses email and password credentials to obtain a bearer token via POST request
    to https://api.nightwatch.io/api/v1/token with JSON body containing email and
    password fields. The returned token should then be used in subsequent API requests
    as a bearer token in the Authorization header.
  - Authentication uses email and password credentials sent in a JSON request body
    to a token endpoint, which returns an access_token that must be included with
    all subsequent requests. The token is permanent until revoked and only needs to
    be obtained once. Send a POST request to https://api.nightwatch.io/api/v1/token
    with email and password parameters in the JSON body to retrieve the access_token
    from the response.
- information_source; https://apidocs.nightwatch.io/authentication/:
  - Nightwatch API uses access_token authentication passed as a URL query parameter.
    Include the access_token parameter in all API requests with your personal access
    token obtained from the app settings at API Access. The request format is https://api.nightwatch.io/some_action?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
    where ACCESS_TOKEN is replaced with your personal token.
- information_source; https://apidocs.nightwatch.io/user/:
  - Authentication uses an access token passed as a query parameter. Include access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
    in the URL query string for all requests to the API endpoint.
  - Nightwatch API uses access token authentication passed as a query parameter. Include
    the access_token query parameter in requests to authenticate, for example access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
    in the URL query string.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.nightwatch.io/keyword-views/:
  - Pagination uses page and limit parameters. The page parameter specifies the page
    number, and the limit parameter specifies the amount of keywords per page. Both
    are optional URL parameters.
  - Use query parameters page (page number) and limit (keywords per page) for pagination.
    The page parameter is optional and controls which page to retrieve, while limit
    controls the number of keywords returned per page.
- information_source; https://apidocs.nightwatch.io/keyword-results/:
  - Use query parameters time_start and time_end to filter results by date range.
    The endpoint returns an array of keyword results with fields including id, position,
    result_url, and created_at; no explicit pagination parameters or response fields
    are documented.
