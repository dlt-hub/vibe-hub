- information_source; https://docs.spicerack.gg/api-reference/introduction:
  - API key authentication is required for all requests. Include the API key in the
    X-API-Key header with the format sk_*****. Member access levels define the permissions
    associated with each API key.
  - All API endpoints require authentication using an API key passed in the X-API-Key
    header with format sk_*****. Invalid or expired keys return 401 Unauthorized,
    insufficient permissions return 403 Forbidden. API keys are created in the organization
    admin panel and tied to member access levels that determine operation permissions.
- information_source; https://docs.spicerack.gg/api-reference/public-decklist-database:
  - API key authentication is required, passed as the X-API-Key header with a value
    prefixed by sk_. Include this header in all requests to the endpoint.
- information_source; https://docs.spicerack.gg/api-reference/decklists/list-decklists:

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.spicerack.gg/api-reference/decklists/list-decklists:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (page number) and page_size (results per
    page), both optional integers. The response includes count (total results), results
    array, next (URI for next page or null), and previous (URI for previous page or
    null); follow next/previous URIs to navigate pages until next becomes null.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination with response fields count, next, previous,
    and results. The next and previous fields contain full URLs to the next and previous
    pages respectively; continue paginating until next is null to reach the end.
