- This page is *not* an actual manual page. It was just made to look like one.
- curl supports command line variables
- curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers
- This command-line tool can connect to various protocols including HTTP and FTP.
- Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior.
- Providing --disable-eprt multiple times has no extra effect.
- Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior.
- Providing --disable-epsv multiple times has no extra effect.
- Accepting and using credentials in a URL is normally considered a security hazard
  as they are easily leaked that way.
