auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.harbor.gg/:
  - The API uses OAuth2 authentication flows across multiple platforms (Facebook,
    Google Play, Roblox, Steam, TikTok, Twitch, Twitter). Authentication is initiated
    by calling platform-specific auth endpoints (e.g., POST /oauth/{platform}/auth
    or /oauth/{platform}/authStart), which return a redirect URL; after user authorization,
    a callback is received with a code query parameter that is exchanged via POST
    /oauth/{platform}/exchange endpoints to obtain user data.
  - The Harbor API uses OAuth2 authentication with support for multiple providers
    (Beamable, Discord, Epic, Facebook, Google Play). Authentication flows involve
    POST requests to provider-specific endpoints like /oauth/{provider}/auth to initiate
    authentication, /oauth/{provider}/exchange to exchange authorization codes for
    user data, and corresponding callback endpoints. Specific header names, parameter
    formats, and token field names are not detailed in the provided documentation
    excerpt.
  - The documentation describes OAuth endpoints for Twitch, Twitter, and YouTube authentication
    flows, including authorization URL generation, callback handling, and token exchange/refresh
    mechanisms. Specifically, POST endpoints at /oauth/twitter/exchange, /oauth/youtube/exchange,
    and /oauth/youtube/accessToken/refresh handle credential exchange and refresh
    using code query parameters and access token refresh operations, indicating an
    OAuth2 authorization code flow with token refresh capability.
- information_source; https://api.harbor.gg/docs/v1/swagger.json:
  - OAuth2 authorization code exchange flow. The endpoint accepts a POST request with
    a JSON body containing code, redirectUrl, projectId, and accountId to exchange
    an authorization code for user identity and profile data.
  - 'POST /oauth/steam/exchange requires a JSON request body with fields: target (object
    with projectId), redirectUrl (string), code (string from OAuth callback), and
    accountId (integer). This is a Steam OAuth2 code exchange endpoint where the code
    is obtained from Steam''s authorization flow and exchanged for user identity and
    profile data.'
