  - Authorization is performed via query parameters in POST requests to complete tasks.
    The group parameter specifies the authorized group and the user parameter specifies
    the authorized user performing the task action. Both parameters are required as
    query strings in the URL when completing a task.

  - The SVG add-on requires a bearer token in the Authorization header when the Data
    Index Service has security enabled. If a security context is detected, the token
    is retrieved automatically; otherwise, a valid bearer token must be passed directly
    in the Authorization header to query the Data Index Service for executed nodes.
