auth_info:
- information_source; https://codersee.com/secure-rest-api-with-ktor-jwt-access-tokens/:
  - JWT-based authentication. Users obtain access tokens via POST /api/auth with username
    and password in a LoginRequest body, then include the token in subsequent requests.
    The JwtService handles token generation and validation.
  - The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. The JWT token is validated through
    a JwtService that creates a JWTPrincipal object, from which claims like "username"
    can be extracted and verified to authenticate requests.
- information_source; https://codersee.com/sending-transactional-emails-ktor-kotlin-mailersend/:
  - The MailerSend API uses token-based authentication. The token must be passed as
    an environment variable named MAILERSEND_TOKEN and configured in the application.conf
    file under the mailersend.token property. The baseUrl should be set to https://api.mailersend.com/v1/
    via the MAILERSEND_BASE_URL environment variable. The token is read at application
    startup and used to configure the HttpClient for subsequent API requests.
