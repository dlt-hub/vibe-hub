auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.zerion.io/reference/authentication:
  - 'Authentication to this API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API
    key as the basic auth username value with no password required. Encode the API
    key followed by a colon (e.g., ''api_key:'') in base64 and pass it in the Authorization
    header as ''Authorization: Basic <base64_string>''. All requests must be made
    over HTTPS.'
  - The API uses an API key for authentication. You must obtain an API key from the
    Zerion developer portal and include it in your requests; the exact header name
    and parameter details are referenced but not shown in this excerpt. Refer to the
    Authentication page at https://developers.zerion.io/reference/authentication for
    complete instructions on how to pass the API key.
- information_source; https://developers.zerion.io/reference/getwalletchart:
  - 'The documentation excerpt shows a "Credentials" section indicating "Basic" authentication
    with base64 encoding, but the actual credential details (username, password, or
    API key format) are not fully specified in this chunk. The curl example shows
    a standard GET request to the Zerion API but does not include the Authorization
    header with the actual basic auth credentials.


    Based on what is visible: Zerion API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with base64-encoded
    credentials sent in the Authorization header, though the specific credential format
    (username:password or api_key) is not clearly detailed in this excerpt.'
