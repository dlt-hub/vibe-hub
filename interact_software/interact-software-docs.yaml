notes:
- The authentication method varies between Interact's APIs
- Uses OAuth Bearer Token-based authentication
- Log Request Body in SCIM Service for more verbose logging
- Supports group provisioning and maintenance via the Groups resource
- Group provisioning attempts to match existing groups to avoid duplication
- Tenant URL should be replaced with your intranet domain.
- Highly recommended to add an email address for provisioning failure notifications.
- Ensure that the Department and Location fields will have values, as these are required
  fields from an Interact perspective.
- Azure will not push an item to Interact if it is null.
- If you want to force a field to either not be blank or force it to sync despite
  a null value, you can switch from a 'direct' field mapping type to 'expression'.
- 'If you have an issue where Power User permissions are being removed, you need to
  make the following configuration change: for the User mapping field ''emails[type
  eq "work"].value'', you need to switch the ''Match objects using this attribute''
  setting to yes and ''Matching precedence'' to 2.'
- If you want no disruption in your existing users, you will need to map the proper
  values from Azure to the fields in Interact before performing the first sync.
- You need to be very careful with using Azure's mapping type 'constant'. The better
  solution is to use the mapping type 'None' and set a default value.
- There is an option at the field mapping level to apply mapping 'Only During Object
  Creation'.
- When you need to map to the jobStartDate field, you can handle it with an expression
  to format the date.
- 'If you want preferred name logic, you can use the expression: IIF(IsNullOrEmpty([preferredname]),[givenname],[preferredname]).'
- 'Microsoft describes the ''None'' type: ''None - the target attribute is left unmodified.
  However, if the target attribute is ever empty, it''s populated with the Default
  value that you specify.'''
- OKTA's Lifecycle Management (LCM) product is required in order to utilize SCIM provisioning.
- Make sure to utilize the Logging provided by OKTA. This will be your only way of
  checking if you have synchronization issues.
- Interact's SCIM implementation has been designed to be extremely verbose and provide
  necessary context with all errors, to ensure you have everything needed to resolve
  any issues.
- You can check if the SCIM service is functional by opening your browser and using
  https://{yourURL}/api/v2/scim/v2/health. You might want to check this if you receive
  any errors.
- If the manager sync functionality is not working while you are testing this functionality,
  you need to ensure that the manager is part of the users being synced. The reconciliation
  of the manager information has to happen on the OKTA side not within Interact...
  so the manager is required to be part of the OKTA Provisioning.
- 'If you receive ''Work phone number attempted to be set twice'', the work-around
  is to remove these mappings: phoneNumbers.^[primary==true].type and phoneNumbers.^[primary==true].value
  and add this mapping: phoneNumbers.^[type==''work''].value.'
- You cannot have an additional field inside Interact that has a questions mark (i.e.
  ?) or other special characters in the field name or the process will not work. You
  will receive an Error 500 when trying to perform any activity within SCIM until
  the issue is resolved.
- OKTA will not push an item to Interact if it is null. So effectively it uses logic
  similar to Interact's 'ApplyBlank' logic for all fields.
- 'If you have an issue where Power User permissions are being removed, you need to
  add the urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:userType field to the OKTA sync
  and provide one of these values for each user: ''Power User'', ''Intranet User'',
  ''Non Intranet User''.'
- 'If you want to add a start date, use a formula like this: String.append(user.startDate,"T01:00:00Z").'
- 'If you want to map the address, you need to map to the Interact field ''formatted''
  which should be automatically added as a target and use a formula like this: user.streetAddress
  + '', '' + user.city + '', '' + user.state + '' '' + user.zipCode.'
- If users are inactive within Interact, you must set the Active field to true to
  force it back to an active state.
- Many customers have a desire to leverage preferred name if it is populated in OKTA
  and firstname if preferredname is not populated in OKTA.
- A caveat to the manager lookup functionality is that the UID value cannot be a numeric
  value or the manager.value lookup will fail.
- There is an option at the field mapping level to 'Create Only'. This option allows
  you to map a field upon the creation of a user.
- The API request uses HTTPS and therefore provides secure encryption during transport.
- The scheduled time must be saved in UTC 24h format.
- Interact will only synchronize users that are members of security groups (or nested
  groups) found in the Group DN.
- This script is provided as an example of how XML can be generated from different
  sources for use with Interacts profile sources.
- Any customization to this script is not supported by Interact.
- Uses API key for authentication — ensure token is configured in Interact
- MFA cannot be enabled for the Workday account.
- Integration runs are avoided on Saturdays due to Workday's Service Outage window.
- This script is provided as an example of how XML can be generated from different
  sources for use with Interacts profile sources. This is not supported by Interact,
  therefore, you should feel free to use this as a starting point and tweak as necessary.
- Uses XML to synchronize user data with Interact.
- Uses API Key for authentication
- XML structure is required to synchronize user data correctly
- XML file generation requires setup of correct API keys and endpoints.
- Ensure the XML structure adheres to the expected schema.
- PowerShell is surprisingly good at reporting errors from the script itself, and
  Interact returns useful error messages if the XML is invalid so troubleshooting
  should be fairly straightforward.
- The version attribute is the version of the schema, matched to a particular Interact
  release version. Current version = 1.
- Azure AD Graph API is deprecated and awaiting retirement.
- Profile synchronization logic supports both Azure AD Graph API and Microsoft Graph
  API.
- We would advise that, before sending the XML file to your Interact instance, you
  validate the XML file against the schema yourself.
- This means that the response from the API usually provides a good error message
  that should direct you on where to look for problems in the XML.
- Field is available in UMI but will not import (known defect)
- Field mappings are required for user data import.
- Images larger than 5MB are not permitted
- More than 6 requests per minute are not permitted
- Profile pictures should be square and sized at 600x600 pixels.
- Images larger than 5MB are not permitted.
- More than 6 requests per minute are not permitted.
- Requires Global administrator or Exchange administrator role in Microsoft 365

- Global administrator or Exchange administrator role in Microsoft 365 is required.
- ApplicationImpersonation role in Exchange Online is required.
- Configuration of a webhook currently needs to be completed by our Technical Support
  team.
- Configuration of a webhook currently needs to be completed by our Technical Support
  team
- The desired Webhook(s) and a URL (Listener) for each Webhook are required for configuration
- The action type is 'WallPost'.
- JavaScript added here is included on every page on your Intranet except for popup
  modals.
- Keep in mind that this can very easily interfere with the normal running processes
  of your site.
- Payload structure varies slightly for profiles.
- This script is not officially supported by Interact and may not work 'out-of-the-box'
  for your organization without additional review and amends from your development
  team
- A list of possible ActionTypes is available here [Enumerated types](/page/enumerated-types)
- The favicon is changed by javascript, so there may be a brief moment when the standard
  interact favicon is visible in the tab
- The developer framework is not loaded for the login screen, or for popup windows,
  so those pages will still show the standard interact favicon
- This function may not be supported in older versions of browsers such as IE8
- Due to the way JavaScript is implemented in web browsers, any errors in your custom
  code can prevent your intranet from working, so proceed with caution.
- Please note - the examples listed in this section are just samples of code to demonstrate
  some of the things that can be accomplished with the developer framework and are
  not supported by the Interact Technical Support team
- This can be used to add as many tabs as you want
- The developer framework allows an interact administrator to extend and customise
  some of the functionality with interact by embedding custom javascript within a
  page
- CSS is included on every page within Interact except for popup boxes.
- Changes to CSS may require more specific selectors to appear on screen.
- Interact handily adds some information about a page to the HTML element of every
  page as items in the class attribute.
- Adding the code above will remove the Share button throughout the application.
- It's important to note though that this doesn't stop users from referencing content
  using Interacts @mentioning feature.
- This CSS needs to be adding to the Custom CSS section of the Developer Framework
  within Interact as normal.
- The synchronisation process currently runs every minute.
- Make sure we only do this if we have an editor
- By default, the ability to configure native connectors is disabled.
- You must select the 'Enable Workplace Search Native Connectors' application variable.
- CSS is included on every page within Interact except for popup boxes, and therefore
  can very easily interfere with aspects of Interact which you don't want it to.
- If changes to the CSS aren't appearing on screen, try making the CSS selector more
  specific to the element.
- Through the use of MasterPage CSS it's possible to hide certain features within
  Interact that can't be removed through Application Variables or license settings.
- A commonly requested feature to be removed is the Like button on content pages.
- The Azure OAuth App does not automatically have access to the SharePoint REST API.
- If modifying an existing app registration to only access selected sites, then be
  sure to fully remove the `Sites.Read.All` scopes.
- Default configuration synchronises all Lists and Drives at most every hour.
- The Azure OAuth App does not automatically have access to the SharePoint REST API,
  so additional steps are required.
- If a drive or list is configured to be synchronised, then all of the items within
  them will be synchronised.
- Set to true to apply permissions to the synchronised content
- If specified, then drive items older than this are not synchronised
- Default schedule configured so that all Lists and Drives are synchronised at most
  every hour.
- The Google Drive connector currently uses a basic strategy when synchronising content.
  There is no delta functionality currently.
- All users external identities and docs are synchronised using the Session deletion
  mode.
- A Service Account with relevant permissions needs to be set up within the Google
  Cloud Platform
- Domain-Wide Delegation may need to be enabled for the service account
- Set to true to indicate that the credentials have Domain Wide Delegation enabled
  and the service account is able to impersonate users to synchronise users individual
  drives
- Set to true to discover users and synchronise each of their my drives
- Debug messages are logged during a synchronisation.
- The credentials of a connector are encrypted during save using the latest industry
  recommended encryption algorithms and best practices.
- Native connectors are configured via JSON fields.
- The encryption level is 256-bit, and in-line with industry best practice and recommendations.
- Using the advanced filter you are able to filter on any of the taxonomy values
- Domain-Wide Delegation is needed for the service account to access user data in
  a Google Workspace organization
- It is currently only possible to use the Advanced Filter to filter on the Standard
  or Custom (associated with List Items) taxonomy values.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Google API
- Some objects may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Digestion is the process of synchronising relevant content associated with a Workplace
  Search Connector.
- For any tenant, each native connector is digested sequentially.
- Automatic deletion requires a synchronisation session to be started and ended.
- The client must populate the materialised paths of documents uniquely.
- By default the log level is set to Information.
- If not enabled by Interact, then will revert to Information level.
- 'Workplace Search vs the REST API: It''s worth pointing out that the Workplace Search
  API is completely distinct from the REST API.'
- 'Some scenarios are not currently possible, such as: Show me files from a particular
  site and folder which have a LastUpdatedDate greater than 1 week ago.'
- Each search application has its own authentication key.
- Use of External Identities for permission management.
- The synchronisation framework supports automatic deletion of users or documents
  that have not been synchronised during a synchronisation session.
- The client is responsible for populating the materialised paths of documents in
  a unique and meaningful way.
- This is not officially supported by Interact, it is intended as a helper and example
  to what is possible with search apps
- There is no error detection or data validation
- When adding files this way there's no checking for duplicates or easy way of deleting
  documents
- This will only work as a bulk import, adding new files to the file system will not
  also add them to Interact
- This is effectively a rebranding of 'Search' across the whole of Interact.
- 'The following log levels are available: Error, Warning, Information, Debug, Verbose.'
- Requires Interact to enable logs at Debug and Verbose levels.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Requires the use of TradingView widgets.
- The hosted site needs to use HTTPS - Interact is securely served via the HTTPS protocol
  following best practise.
- The hosted site (including any intermediate SSO sites) need to allow itself to be
  served in an iFrame.
- Each search application that you create will have its own authentication key.
- The X-ApiKey header is used to send the authentication key.
- This is not officially supported by Interact, it is intended as a helper and example
  to what is possible with search apps.
- There is no error detection or data validation.
- When adding files this way there's no checking for duplicates or easy way of deleting
  documents.
- This will only work as a bulk import, adding new files to the file system will not
  also add them to Interact.
- Uses OAuth 2.0 password-bearer authentication
- Recommended to use a dedicated user account for API connectivity
- SAML single sign-on is tied to your domain name.
- If a custom URL is selected, then you will likely need to configure this against
  both your interactgo domain and the custom URL.
- You'll need to edit the script to include your own API Key which is added when setting
  up the search app within Interact
- Configuring auto-login requires making Okta the Default Provider.
- In order for users to log in to Interact via OneLogin, the user account needs to
  be present in OneLogin and also in Interact, and the user has to be given access
  in OneLogin.
- If you need to make any changes to the Edit SAML Authentication page after the SAML
  source was added, you may not see the changes immediately - the settings are cached
  to improve performance; wait ten minutes before trying again.
- Custom Apps are injected into the front-end of your environment at run-time, and
  evaluated after the initial page load
- The Certificate should have a .cert extension, if it doesn't this will need to be
  edited before uploading
- Once configured you may have to wait up to 24 hours initially as specified by Google.
- For this to be implemented in your intranet, you need to modify the URLs to include
  your own domain, along with the sectionids for the content area you want to search.
- Requires setup of connected app in Azure
- Interact supports the use of SAML metadata to configure both the service provider
  and identity provider components of Interact.
- When the SAML login type has been selected, the UI will then display that user’s
  access type as ‘Local Directory’ rather than ‘SAML’. This is expected behaviour
  and will not have any influence on the SAML configuration chosen for the user.
- When using Local Directory login methods, make sure the Password Strength settings
  are set inline with your Organisation's security policies, and guidelines.
- Setup a new App Registration in Azure Portal
- Gather Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, Redirect URI and Application
  ID URI.
- The previous procedure for creating a Yammer widget used a javascript snippet in
  the HTML widget - due to changes in the way Microsoft presents Yammer, this approach
  no longer works.
- Requires a dedicated user account for API connectivity.
- If a custom URL is selected, you may need to configure it against both your interactgo
  domain and the custom URL.
- The MS Teams integration requires the Teams login to authenticate against the user's
  email address associated with their intranet profile.
- Downloading files from Interact is not available through the MS Teams app in either
  the browser or the Teams Apps.
- After adding Okta as an Identity Provider, you can configure Interact to automatically
  redirect users to Okta for authentication.
- Users with passwords local to Interact can continue to access the native Interact
  login page by appending 'local-login' to your site's URL.
- Case Sensitive Redirect URLs
- Editing Marketplace Configuration will forcibly purge authentication tokens of all
  users
- Interact will poll Slack APIs every 10 seconds to retrieve updates for specific
  channels.
- Slack enforces Rate Limits to their APIs.
- Files uploaded via Interact are not subject to security scanning (e.g. AV, Malware)
  within Interact.
- Interact only permits files under 28MB to be uploaded to Slack.
- Interact supports the use of federation Metadata for automatically loading the Service
  Provider settings into the relevant Identity Provider (in this case ADFS).
- The optional token encryption certificate is not required by Interact and this step
  should be skipped.
- Ensure that Permit all users to access this relay party is checked.
- Redirect URLs are Case Sensitive and Whitespace Sensitive
- You may have to wait up to 24 hours initially as specified by Google.
- Microsoft 365 Marketplace integrations do not support user authorization - all permission
  scopes must receive admin consent.

- In December 2017 Interact disabled support for TLS 1.0.
- TLS1.0 is a relatively old technology and has several vulnerabilities that necessitated
  removing support for TLS1.0 and requiring connections to use TLS1.1 or TLS1.2.
- For most people this will have had no effect, however any customers who are using
  PowerShell to automate tasks such as General Profile Sources for XML imports, or
  Profile Pictures will see an error.
- 'Powershell by default will always try and connect using TLS1.0 and so any attempt
  to connect will result in the following error: The underlying connection was closed:
  An unexpected error occurred on a send.'

  and instructs PowerShell to use TLS1.2.
