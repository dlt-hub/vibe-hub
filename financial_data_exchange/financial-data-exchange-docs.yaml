notes:
- Requires valid MTLS certificate on all API requests, excluding requests to authorize
  an endpoint.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- APImetrics lets you make and run API calls or sequences of API calls (workflows)
  from external, remote cloud locations using exactly the same security configurations
  as a typical end user would use.
- Publicly available collections of API monitoring for a variety of API products
- APImetrics is calling your server just like an end user would.
- APIs can be run on a one-off basis or scheduled to run automatically.
- Continuous observation at a reasonable frequency allows us to generate meaningful
  data on your API performance and warn you when things go wrong.
- You can create and edit schedules so that you can exercise your APIs at exactly
  the frequency you need from the locations that matter to your users.
- Start with simple assertions (status codes, headers), then add deeper content checks
  as your needs grow.
- Use the `_raw` path for non-standard responses or when you need total control over
  matching.
- Add response size checks as a safety net against payload changes or API errors.
- Update assertions as your API evolves.
- Check test results regularly and adjust your checks for new endpoints or behaviors.
- Certificates are global and can be used across multiple projects.
- Certificates are cached, and it might take up to an hour for a new certificate to
  come into use after being uploaded.
- Moving and copying scheduled calls and workflows requires removal of the schedule
  before moving.
- Copying authentications does not copy the calls that use that authentication.
- APIContext offers the ability to add in third party information to enhance the visibility
  of synthetic monitoring calls.
- This integration filters your DS2 stream to only include APIContext synthetic monitoring
  calls.
- The integration is lightweight and only logs filtered synthetic traffic based on
  your test cadence.
- This adaptor is currently in beta. Please contact us at support@apicontext.com
- This integration is part of our Observation offering.
- This adaptor is currently in beta.
- Do not use your AWS root user privileges for these operations.
- This plug only builds on Windows.
- This adaptor is currently in beta. Please contact us at support@apicontext.com.
- Use host.docker.internal instead of localhost for services running locally.
- You will need to create a new API Key for APImetrics by following the tutorial and
  choosing Ingress as your Access Level.
- Remember best practices for security - your API Key should be sourced from your
  secrets or configmaps and not pasted directly into your YAML file.
- WSGI is compatible with most of the popular Python web frameworks, including Flask,
  Bottle and web2py.
- API Key can be created in the Inventory section.
- API Key can be found under the Advanced section in APImetrics API.
- Remember to select Save once you have added your Notes to ensure they are retained.
- You can set project-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), which can also be used
  to track Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
- SLOs can be created based on the timing of the whole API call, or based on the timing
  for a single component of the call.
- Disable Security and Schema Conformance Monitoring for Specific APIs
- 'To exclude an API endpoint from Schema and Security Conformance monitoring: Navigate
  to the API endpoint: Browse to the "Edit API Call" page of the desired API endpoint.'
- Calls MUST be scheduled through a weekend to get insights
- Reports are an easy way to see and share results for your APIs
- Reports can be shared publicly either as a webpage or embedded as a script in your
  own site
- Investigation Mode is a way to drill into results quickly and see what happened
  around that result
- All API calls have a maximum timeout of 2 minutes.
- If you wish your API to POST multi-part form data, you can create a file that encapsulated
  the full form data using our helper form.
- Choose the type of each part you want to add by using the Part Type picker.
- The text option allows you to pass form data along with a file.
- You can choose to upload a file, or to create multi-part from data that encapsulated
  multiple files
- You must use an HTTP method of POST or PUT to upload content with the request
- To import from Postman, generate a Postman API key.
- To import from APIMATIC, we need your API's API integration key.
- You may need to set up any environment variables your API calls require.
- Default pass HTTP 2xx status code
- Default failure HTTP 5xx status code
- Default warning HTTP 4xx status code
- Every API call has a set of detailed API stats that can be analyzed separately
- Use Assertions to capture the value.
- Set an environment variable to the captured value.
- Use the environment variable in your API calls.
- The delay API supports a maximum delay of 10 seconds per call.
- We normally recommend a frequency of one call, per location, every 10-15 minutes
  i.e. 4-6 times per hour.
- Even though you might have a gateway rated to thousands of calls per minute, we
  have seen behavior where if 2 or more calls arrive within a few milliseconds of
  each other, the calls will be rate-limited on the assumption that the API calls
  will exceed the limit.
- All API calls have a maximum timeout of 2 minutes. However, if a schedule has a
  frequency of once every 2 minutes or faster, the maximum timeout is half the frequency.
- Downtime is set for your current time, and will adjust for daylight savings automatically
- Downtime Schedule auto-adjustments ensure optimal scheduling during downtime periods
- APImetrics CANNOT import the encrypted API key
- You cannot import a Postman Collection you have not saved
- 'Ensure timing accuracy by adding a ''Connection: close'' header to the API calls
  in the Collection.'
- Creating a sequence of calls to obtain a token, save that token as a variable and
  then use the token in following API calls.
- This approach should be used with non-standard OAuth configurations.
- Uses Manual Authentication with custom Auth Token to handle auth scenarios.
- To add Mutual TLS to an API authentication, you first need to define the type of
  authentication the API call will use by selecting Authentication Settings > Create
  New Authentication.
- We do not recommend using email for alerting due to the potential for a high volume
  of alerts if your application experiences an interruption.
- PagerDuty integrations require Owner or Editor access to a project.
- Send data from APImetrics to any platform that intakes OpenTelemetry.
- Send data from APImetrics to AWS with our OpenTelemetry Webhook
- By default, conformance failures are sent to Datadog.
- You can also send conformance passes by adjusting the toggle switch.
- 'Generate an Access Token for APIContext in your Dynatrace environment, with the
  following scopes: Ingest logs, Ingest metrics, and Ingest OpenTelemetry traces.'
- Monitoring results will be passed to Hydrolix starting from the next test call.
- Webhook allows sending API traffic to Java SDK
- Send data from APImetrics to New Relic with OpenTelemetry Webhook
- Our OpenTelemetry Webhook allows you to send your API traffic to Nginx.
- Our OpenTelemetry Webhook allows you to send your API traffic to PHP SDK.
- Webhook allows you to send your API traffic to Java SDK with OpenTelemetry.
- Allows sending API traffic to Sumo Logic using OpenTelemetry Webhook
- Monitoring results will be passed to TrafficPeak starting from the next test call.
  Please alert your TrafficPeak account team to enable field mapping.
- Allows you to send your API traffic to Tyk with OpenTelemetry Webhook.
- Webhook setup allows sending API traffic to VMWare.
- Sometimes there are endpoints that only send bad results, such as failures or reporting
  issues. Although this is how this endpoint is meant to function, it will have a
  negative impact on your CASC score.
- APImetrics will automatically add a new Header for Content-Type, populated with
  application/json.
- You can specify a query parameter 'debug=1' which will enable pretty-printing of
  the JSON results.
- We would typically suggest something simple in the header like X-trace or similar
  that can be ignored by your backend, but give you something to search for you in
  your results.
- All calls will then be 'watermarked' with a unique ID number.
- Extracting and manipulating strings in returned payloads
- Standard XPath syntax is used.
- CASC score blends availability, latency, and number of outliers using proprietary
  machine learning technology
- Scores generated on a weekly and calendar month basis
- IP Addresses MAY change in the future, we will endeavor to announce any changes
  to these IP addresses in advance.
- These IP addresses are also stored as `eu.agents.apimetrics.io`
- These IP addresses are also stored as `na.agents.apimetrics.io`
- These IP addresses are also stored as `oc.agents.apimetrics.io`
- These IP addresses are also stored as `sa.agents.apimetrics.io`
- Multiple System Variables can be combined (concatenated) to construct specific input
  values.
- 'Once you have an Access Token, you can use it to authenticate your API v3 requests
  by including it in the Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer<Access_Token>'
