- Access the browser-based demo version with limited functionality to test G6Solver
  capabilities
- Subscribe for $20 AUD/month to get the full desktop application with advanced features
- If exposing your Ollama server beyond your local machine, implement security measures
  like a reverse proxy with HTTPS and authentication.
- The BAM must implement everything the CSF requires, but now with concrete engineering
  details.
- Take a 'checkpoint' at least every 10% of the total execution.
- Rollback must complete within one normal operation time.
- Some operations are permanently destructive.
- Trusted states ensure that from any trusted state, any reversible operation either
  stays trusted or fails safely.
- Safety is never traded for improvement
- Exploration is controlled
- Comprehensive documentation is available by running the G6 desktop application.
