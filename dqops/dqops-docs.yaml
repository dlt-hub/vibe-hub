auth_info:
- information_source; https://dqops.com/docs/dqo-concepts/running-data-quality-checks/:
  - For connecting to a DQOps instance with authentication enabled, use the AuthenticatedClient
    class with a DQOps API Key token. The token is passed as the token parameter when
    instantiating the client, and it should be obtained from the user profile screen
    in DQOps.
- information_source; https://dqops.com/docs/dqo-concepts/data-storage-of-data-quality-results/:
  - DQOps uses an API key-based authentication scheme. The client is instantiated
    with AuthenticatedClient, passing a token parameter that represents the DQOps
    local API Key, which is then used to authenticate requests to the local DQOps
    API server (typically at http://localhost:8888/).
  - The DQOps Python client uses a local API key for authentication. Pass the API
    key as the token parameter when creating an AuthenticatedClient instance, which
    will include it in requests to the DQOps instance. The token is sent as authentication
    credentials to the DQOps server running at the specified URL.
- information_source; https://dqops.com/docs/client/:
  - Connection to a DQOps instance requires a valid API Key passed as the token parameter
    to the AuthenticatedClient constructor. The token is used internally by the client
    to authenticate requests to the DQOps REST API. Pass the API Key string directly
    to the token parameter when instantiating AuthenticatedClient with the base URL
    of your DQOps instance.
  - The API uses Bearer token authentication sent in the Authorization header. To
    authenticate, create an AuthenticatedClient with a token parameter (your personal
    API Key), and the client automatically includes it as a Bearer token in the Authorization
    header with each request.
