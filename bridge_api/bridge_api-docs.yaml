auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bridgeapi.io/docs/basics:
  - 'The API uses three required headers for authentication: Client-Id (set to your
    client ID), Client-Secret (set to your client secret), and Authorization with
    a Bearer token (set to your access token). All three credentials must be included
    in the request headers.'
- information_source; https://docs.bridgeapi.io/docs/user-creation-authentication:
  - The API requires a Bridge-Version header in requests. User authentication is performed
    by sending a POST request to the /v3/aggregation/authorization/token endpoint
    with a user_uuid field in the JSON body, which returns an authentication token.
    Users can be created with an external_user_id field that can be used for authentication
    and dashboard lookup.
  - 'To obtain an access token, POST to https://api.bridgeapi.io/v3/aggregation/authorization/token
    with a JSON body containing external_user_id. The response includes access_token
    and expires_at. For authenticated requests, include the access_token in the Authorization
    header using Bearer scheme: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>. Also include
    Bridge-Version, Client-Id, and Client-Secret headers in API calls.'
- information_source; https://docs.bridgeapi.io/v2021.06.01/docs/basics:
  - 'Bridge API requires four headers for authentication: Client-Id (your client ID),
    Client-Secret (your client secret), Authorization with a Bearer token (your access
    token), and Bridge-Version (API version). Send all four headers with each request
    to authenticate.'
  - 'The API requires four authentication headers in all requests: Bridge-Version
    (API version identifier), Client-Id (your client ID), Client-Secret (your client
    secret), and Authorization with a Bearer token (your access token). Send these
    as HTTP headers in the format shown: ''Bridge-Version: VERSION'', ''Client-Id:
    MY_CLIENT_ID'', ''Client-Secret: MY_CLIENT_SECRET'', and ''Authorization: Bearer
    TOP_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN''.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.bridgeapi.io/docs/basics:
  - Paginated responses include a pagination object with a next_uri field containing
    the full path for the next page request. Use the next_uri value to fetch subsequent
    pages; stop when next_uri is absent or null.
- information_source; https://docs.bridgeapi.io/v2021.06.01/docs/basics:
  - Bridge uses cursor-based pagination with the `after` query parameter to specify
    the cursor position. The `limit` query parameter controls results per page (default
    50). Paginated responses include a `pagination` object with a `next_uri` field
    for fetching the next page.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme. The response includes a pagination object
    with a next_uri field containing the complete URL for the next page, including
    limit and after parameters that should be used in subsequent requests.
  - Use query string parameters `limit` and `after` for GET requests to paginate results.
    The `limit` parameter controls page size, and `after` is used as a cursor to fetch
    subsequent pages by passing a value (like a timestamp or ID) to retrieve records
    after that point.
