auth_info:
- information_source; https://support.doforms.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001552702-doForms-REST-API-Guide:
  - All requests require an Authorization header with the value "Bearer [token]".
    Obtain a user token by posting web user credentials to the /tokens/user endpoint,
    or obtain a web service token by posting web service credentials to the /tokens/webservice
    endpoint. Requests inherit the rights associated with the token type used.
  - Web service authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Static
    tokens are built by combining web service ID and password with a colon separator
    in the format "Bearer {webServiceId}:{password}". Alternatively, obtain a dynamic
    token by posting web service credentials to the /tokens/webservice endpoint. Reseller
    authentication uses tokens obtained by posting reseller credentials to the /tokens/reseller
    endpoint, also sent as Bearer tokens in the Authorization header.
  - Webservice authentication is used to establish the project and form context for
    API requests. The documentation references "webservice authentication" as a method
    for querying submissions, but does not provide explicit details on how to implement
    it, such as required headers, parameters, token format, or credential passing
    mechanism.
- information_source; https://support.doforms.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061840433-Webhooks:
  - Requests must be authenticated using an Authorization header with a Bearer token
    that combines the webservice Id and webservice password in the format Bearer {webservice
    Id}:{webservice password}. The credentials are base64-encoded and sent in the
    Authorization header.
