auth_info:
- information_source; https://bandcamp.com/developer:
  - Access tokens are sent via the Authorization header with Bearer scheme and expire
    after one hour. To refresh an expired token, make a POST request to https://bandcamp.com/oauth_token
    with URL-encoded form data containing grant_type set to "refresh_token", client_id,
    client_secret, and refresh_token. Alternatively, use grant_type "client_credentials"
    to obtain new tokens, though calling this twice may result in a duplicate_grant
    error if multiple active grants exist.
- information_source; https://bandcamp.com/developer/account:
  - 'All API calls require Bearer token authentication. Send your access token in
    the Authorization header as "Authorization: Bearer {your access token}".'
- information_source; https://bandcamp.com/developer/merch:
  - 'The Merch Orders API is protected by OAuth 2.0. All endpoints require the Authorization
    header set to "Authorization: Bearer {your access token}" where {your access token}
    is your OAuth 2.0 access token. Requests must be POSTs.'
