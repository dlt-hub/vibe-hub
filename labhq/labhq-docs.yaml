notes:
- MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if login credentials have been
  compromised.
- MFA can be enforced for all users in your LabHQ organisation within the administrative
  settings.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- A file limit of 200MB applies to the imported results data. CSV files over 200MB
  will be rejected and no data uploaded.
- 'CSV filenames must not contain spaces (remove them prior to upload). The only permitted
  characters are alphanumeric and the following special characters: `!` `-` `_` `.`
  `*` `''` `(` `)`'
- Imported results data will only be visible within LabHQ’s reporting tools when at
  least one result with a matching client, product, test method, and test method output
  has been entered via the lifecycle of LabHQ (i.e. not imported).
- Only a single CSV file containing results data may be imported. Uploading a CSV
  results data file into LabHQ will overwrite any previously imported data.
- Test methods are used to define the requirements for data collecting during the
  processing of analytical data.
- LabHQ has a password policy that cannot be changed.
- The Reset User Authenticator option will only appear if a user has MFA enabled,
  MFA is set to Authenticator app, and is not performing the action on their own account.
- A job can contain a maximum of 200 samples.
- Each sample can contain a maximum of 200 tests.
