auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mdlogic.com/solutions/api-documentation:
  - End user credentials (UserName and Password) are submitted via POST to the Login
    endpoint, which returns an OAuth 2 Bearer token (access_token) that must be included
    in all subsequent API calls to identify the user and their access privileges.
    The token has an expiration time specified in expires_in (seconds). All communication
    uses SSL encryption.
- information_source; https://www.mdlogic.com/solutions/standard-api-documentation:
  - MD Logic API requires an API Key to access the API. The API Key is a secret key
    that must be provided with requests, though the documentation does not explicitly
    specify the header name, query parameter name, or other transmission method for
    the API Key.
  - 'MD Logic''s API uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT-based access tokens. All requests require
    an Authorization header with format "Authorization: Bearer MY_JWT_TOKEN". Confidential
    clients receive a client_id and client_secret to obtain access tokens via authorization
    code grant flow; refresh tokens are valid for 3 months and single-use only. Public
    applications receive only a client_id and use authorization code flow without
    a client_secret. Single patient applications require additional authentication
    via View My Health Records credentials, and the associated Medical Office must
    enable patient access.'
