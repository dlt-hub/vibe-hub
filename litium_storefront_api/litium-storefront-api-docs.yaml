- Litium is an e-commerce platform with an integrated PIM and CMS.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Litium
- Requires the site to have HTTPS for login to work (also required for test environments).
- The tutorial is tested in Windows only, it may work on additional platforms but
  this is currently not tested or supported.

- When running Litium in a non-windows environment you cannot use the windows credentials
  to log in.
- To log in you need to access your site over encrypted communication (https).
- When running Litium Apps in containers (docker) the localhost domain will always
  point to the container itself and can't be used in the communication between the
  app and Litium.
- To solve the communication between the app and Litium, we will use a custom domain
  that resolves to the host of the container.
- For Mac From Docker 4.24 and newer versions, there is a known issue which stops
  the DnsResolver from starting.
- The test framework makes it easier to write unit tests for applications based on
  the Litium platform.
