  - Custom headers can be added to HTTP requests via the requestOptions configuration.
    The example shows an X-Auth-Token header being set to a custom value (xxx), allowing
    authentication credentials to be passed in request headers. Additionally, client
    certificates with optional passphrases can be configured for mutual TLS authentication,
    and a custom CA bundle path can be specified for SSL verification.

  - 'Notion API uses bearer token authentication. Set the API key (starts with `secret_`)
    as the `NOTION_API_KEY` environment variable, then pass it in the `Authorization:
    Bearer` header along with the `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28` header in requests
    to https://api.notion.com/v1/.'
- information_source; https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers:
  - The HTTP context provider requires a POST request to a specified URL with optional
    custom headers. The Authorization header can be set using Bearer token authentication
    (e.g., "Bearer <token>"). The receiving endpoint should expect POST parameters
    including query and fullInput as strings, and must return a 200 OK response with
    a JSON array of ContextItem objects.
