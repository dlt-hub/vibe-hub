auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.api.flow.bio/rest/authentication:
  - 'Flow uses a two-token authentication system. Refresh tokens are long-lived JWTs
    stored in HTTP-only cookies obtained from POST /login with username and password
    credentials. Access tokens are short-lived JWTs obtained from GET /token endpoint
    using the refresh token cookie and must be included in HTTP request headers for
    authenticated requests.


    Key details: Refresh tokens last one year and are set as HTTP-only cookies by
    the /login endpoint. Access tokens last thirty minutes and are retrieved from
    /token endpoint by sending the refresh token cookie. Authenticated requests require
    the access token in HTTP headers (exact header name not fully specified in provided
    text).'
  - 'Flow.bio uses a refresh token flow for authentication. Send a GET request to
    https://api.flow.bio/token with the refresh token in a cookie named flow_refresh_token
    to obtain an access token. Include the access token in subsequent authenticated
    requests using the Authorization header with Bearer scheme: Authorization: Bearer
    YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN. Alternatively, the /login endpoint can return an access token
    directly without requiring a separate refresh request.'
