notes:
- You should whitelist at least one IP before your API access begins to work. Please
  keep in mind that only IPv4 addresses can be used.
- The sandbox environment is separate and independent from the production one.
- On BasicDNS/PremiumDNS/FreeDNS, you can add up to 150 subdomains (including www)
  per a domain name.
- Each subdomain can be up to 60 characters long.
- Normally, it takes 30 minutes for newly created records to take effect.
- Some DNS systems (including the Namecheap system) have the tendency to automatically
  add the domain name to the values submitted during record creation.
errors:
- API calls restriction is 50/min, 700/hour, and 8000/day across the whole key.
