  - Pass an API key in the Authorization header as Bearer token. The Store Hash identifier
    is required in the URL path for most endpoints and can be found in the API Keys
    section of your Stamped dashboard. Authentication requires a Professional or Enterprise
    plan.
  - When you sign up for a Stamped account, you receive a public API key and private
    API key. Authentication to private endpoints uses HTTP Basic Auth where the API
    Key serves as the username and the API Secret as the password. Public endpoints
    typically require only the store hash or public key.
