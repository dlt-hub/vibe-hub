  - OAuth2 authentication is required. Obtain tokens via POST to https://online-go.com/oauth2/token/
    using grant_type=password with username, password, client_id, and client_secret
    parameters. Refresh expired tokens using grant_type=refresh_token with username,
    refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret. Use the obtained token in subsequent
    API requests (typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer token).
  - The OGS API supports multiple authentication mechanisms. The primary approach
    mirrors the web client, using REST calls to https://online-go.com/api/v1/ui/config
    and https://online-go.com/api/v0/login to obtain authentication tokens. Alternatively,
    bot accounts can use an API key generated on the bot's account page; after opening
    a real-time connection, send a bot/id command with the API key as a parameter
    to receive authentication tokens. OAuth2 keys are also mentioned as a possible
    third option, though their usage is unclear and would likely replace the standard
    login and config REST calls. The documentation does not provide exact header names,
    parameter formats, or implementation details for any of these mechanisms.
  - 'To authenticate with the Online Go Server API, first call the login endpoint
    at https://online-go.com/api/v0/login to receive session cookies. For subsequent
    REST API POST requests, include these cookies in the request. If a "csrftoken"
    cookie is received, also include the header Referer: https://online-go.com/ and
    X-CSRFToken: header with the csrftoken cookie value. The RT (real-time) API connection
    uses the same session established from the login call.'
  - Username and password are sent via POST request body (application/json) to the
    login endpoint at https://online-go.com/api/v0/login with fields "username" and
    "password". The server responds with HTTP cookies that must be included in all
    subsequent REST requests for authentication. Additionally, a GET request to https://online-go.com/api/v1/ui/config
    (authenticated with those cookies) returns a config structure containing "chat_auth"
    and "notification_auth" strings used for later authentication, plus a "user" struct
    with "username" and "id" fields. RT API calls are sent as JSON-encoded text frames
    over a websocket connection to wss://online-go.com/socket.io/?transport=websocket.

  - OGS uses OAuth2 for API authentication. Applications must be generated through
    the Developer portal to obtain OAuth2 application tokens. The REST API is browseable
    at https://online-go.com/api/.
