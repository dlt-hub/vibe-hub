- information_source; https://developer.accuweather.com/documentation/authentication:
  - AccuWeather uses API key authentication. Include your API key as a query parameter
    named `apikey` in all requests. Store the key securely as an environment variable
    and never hardcode it in client-side applications. A 401 Unauthorized response
    indicates an invalid or missing API key.
