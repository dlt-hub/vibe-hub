  - 'Magento 2 supports three authentication types: OAuth 1.0a for third-party apps,
    tokens for mobile apps, and login credentials for admins and customers. Accounts
    and integrations are assigned to resources, and the API framework checks authorization
    for each request.'
- information_source; https://firebearstudio.com/blog/the-ultimate-magento-2-rest-api-guide.html:
  - Authorization requires a Bearer token for an administrator. Send the administrator
    token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <administrator token>" when making
    requests to the Magento 2 REST API shipment creation endpoint.
  - Authorization requires a Bearer token. Include the administrator token in the
    Authorization header as "Bearer <administrator token>" when making requests to
    protected endpoints like order retrieval and invoice creation.
  - 'Authorization uses a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. The token
    is a customer token obtained from Magento 2 authentication and must be included
    as "Authorization: Bearer <customer token>" in the request headers.'
  - Authorization uses a Bearer token scheme. The customer token must be included
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer <customer token>". For guest customers,
    no authorization token is required when using the V1/guest-carts/<cartId>/items
    endpoint. The Content-Type header must be set to application/json.
