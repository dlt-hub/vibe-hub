auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.digital.ai/xl-release/22.1.x/rest-docs/:
  - Authentication uses XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens. Send the token value
    in both the Cookie header as XSRF-TOKEN and in the X-XSRF-TOKEN request header.
  - Basic authentication is required. Send user credentials in the Authorization header
    using the standard HTTP Basic Auth format (base64-encoded username:password).
    Incorrect credentials return a 401 Unauthorized response. Additionally, access
    to specific endpoints requires appropriate permissions; missing permissions return
    a 403 Forbidden response.
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication uses username and password encoded in Base64 and sent
    in the Authorization header as "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>".
    Personal access tokens are sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>". OAuth2 tokens are also sent in the Authorization header as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>".'
  - The API uses XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token-based authentication. Send
    the XSRF token in both the Cookie header as XSRF-TOKEN and in the X-XSRF-TOKEN
    request header with matching values.
  - The API uses XSRF token-based authentication. Include the XSRF token in both the
    Cookie header as XSRF-TOKEN and in the X-XSRF-TOKEN request header with the same
    value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.digital.ai/xl-release/22.1.x/rest-docs/:
  - Pagination is controlled via query parameters page (zero-indexed, default 0) and
    resultsPerPage (default 100) in the POST request to the search endpoint. The response
    structure for pagination fields is not shown in this documentation excerpt.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page and resultsPerPage to control which
    page is returned and how many results per page. The response is an array of user
    objects, but no pagination metadata fields (like next, has_more, or total_count)
    are documented in the response structure provided.
  - 'Pagination uses optional query parameters: page (page number) and resultsPerPage
    (number of results per page). The depth parameter is also optional and controls
    result depth.'
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 0) and resultsPerPage (default
    25) for active releases, plus archivePage (default 0) and archiveResultsPerPage
    (default 25) for archived releases. The response structure indicates pagination
    state but specific response fields indicating next page availability or total
    count are not documented in the provided text.
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (starting at 0), resultsPerPage (default
    100), and pageIsOffset (boolean flag indicating if page represents an offset or
    page number). The response structure for pagination fields is not shown in this
    excerpt.
