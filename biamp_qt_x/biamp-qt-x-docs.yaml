notes:
- 802.1X is not supported while in single cable mode.
- A Qt X controller in dual cable mode while set to Dante media mode does not support
  802.1x.
- A GUID stands for 'Globally Unique Identifier,' which is a 128-bit code used to
  uniquely identify digital objects.
- Qt X devices are shipped in an 'unprotected' state to allow installers to configure
  and use the device without requiring explicit authentication or authorization
- Device IP discovery is done via a network connection to port 1 using the Biamp Discovery
  app or Biamp Tesira software.
- The web UI will prompt for authentication. The default username is admin and the
  default password is the device's 8-digit serial number.
- Firmware must be release 4.0 or later to support the TesiraFORTÉ X and Devio SCX.
- Always be sure to load the latest firmware to ensure hardware is up to date.
- VoIP X is entirely software-based and is configured solely via an internally-served
  web page.
- Analog input channel 1 is routed to all speaker outputs and to other available far
  end outputs.
- SSH is the default protocol for TTP but Telnet can be enabled if needed.
- The Control ports (P1) of each TesiraFORTÉ X need to be on a common control network.
  (FW 4.0 and 4.1)
- The AVB ports (P2-P5) of the TesiraFORTÉ X need to be on a common AVB network to
  share media. (FW 4.0 and 4.1)
- A maximum of (3) TC-5 has been recommended with one TesiraFORTÉ X to ensure that
  stream counts and hop limits are observed.
- A rare issue can occur when updating TesiraLUX resulting in the device not booting
  completely after a firmware update. If this occurs, power-cycling the TesiraLUX
  device will result in normal operation with the updated firmware.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Confirm that the Mitel server is using a T1/E1 connection or Mitel MBG.
- The PIN code must be a number.
errors:
- 'Unauthorized: Check username and password'
- 'Device not found: Ensure the device is powered and connected to the network'
- VLAN configuration issues may lead to discarded ingress traffic.
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
