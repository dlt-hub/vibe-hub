auth_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.tenfold.com/:
  - 'API calls to the Tenfold Analytics API require Bearer token authentication. Include
    the access token in the Authorization header as ''Authorization: Bearer myaccesstoken''
    where myaccesstoken is your actual access token. The token is sent as a Bearer
    token in the HTTP Authorization header.'
  - 'API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer myaccesstoken" for all requests to contact list
    endpoints.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token scheme. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as ''Authorization: Bearer myaccesstoken'' for all API requests to the
    analytics endpoints.'
  - 'Authentication uses username and password credentials sent in a JSON request
    body to obtain an access token. The returned accessToken must be included in subsequent
    requests as an Authorization header with the format "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN".'

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://apidocs.tenfold.com/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 0) and pageSize (default 100).
    The page parameter retrieves a given page number, and pageSize defines how many
    results per page. No response fields for pagination state are documented.
  - 'Pagination uses two query parameters: page (default 0) for specifying which page
    to retrieve, and pageSize (default 100) for defining how many results per page.
    No explicit stop condition or next/previous fields are described in the provided
    documentation.'
  - Size is a query parameter with a default value of 50 that controls the number
    of results returned per request. However, the documentation provided does not
    describe how to navigate between pages, what response fields indicate pagination
    state, or when to stop paginating.
