notes:
- If you already have a configured web server, skip to deployment.
- During provisioning, Deployer will ask about PHP versions, database preferences,
  and more.
- Deployer uses root user by default, but you can change it via -o provision_user=your-user
- If your webserver is using an OpenSSH version older than v7.6, updating the code
  may fail with the error message unsupported option 'accept-new'.
- Deployer uses ACL by default for setting up permissions.
- 'Deployer operates around two main concepts: hosts and tasks.'
- By default, the dep CLI looks for a deploy.php or deploy.yaml file in the current
  directory.
- 'The concurrency: production_environment is important as it prevents concurrent
  deploys.'
- 'Deployer CLI requires two arguments to run: a task to run and a selector.'
- If a selector is not specified, Deployer will ask you to choose a host from a list.
- 'The `concurrency: production_environment` is important as it prevents concurrent
  deploys.'
- It is not recommended to commit secrets to the repository, you could use a GitLab
  variable to store them instead.
- Common recipe comes with a few predefined config params listed below.
- Best practice is to leave connecting information for hosts in the ~/.ssh/config
  file.
- This is documentation for Deployer 6.x, which is no longer actively maintained.
