auth_info:

  - 'API requests require two authentication credentials sent in headers: an Authorization
    header with a Bearer token (JWT format), and an X-Application-Key header with
    an application key. Both must be included in requests to the API.'
  - 'API requests require two authentication credentials sent in request headers.
    The Authorization header must contain a Bearer token in JWT format (example: "Bearer
    eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImp0aSI6ImFmODNk"). Additionally, the X-Application-Key
    header must be included with an application key value (example: "eyXai0XD7SLLzaOeJW").'
  - API uses Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header and requires
    an X-Application-Key header. The Authorization header expects a JWT token prefixed
    with "Bearer ", and X-Application-Key contains an application-specific key string.
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer token (JWT) passed in the Authorization header. Include
    Authorization: Bearer {token} where {token} is a valid JWT. The Accept and Content-Type
    headers should be set to application/vnd.kangaroorewards.api.v1+json and application/json
    respectively.'
  - 'Authentication uses Bearer tokens in the Authorization header. Include the header
    Authorization: Bearer {token} where the token is a JWT. Additionally, include
    the X-Application-Key header with your application key value in requests.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.kangaroorewards.com/docs:
  - Pagination uses a page query parameter (e.g., ?page=2) to navigate through results.
    By default, 100 objects are returned per page. The meta object in the response
    contains a total key indicating the total number of objects available, which helps
    determine pagination scope.
  - Pagination uses optional query parameters page (integer) and per_page (integer).
    The response structure indicates paginated data is returned in a data array, though
    specific response fields for navigation (such as next, has_more, or total) are
    not shown in the provided documentation excerpt.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with per_page (integer, optional) and page
    (integer, optional) query parameters to control pagination. The response includes
    a data array containing paginated results, though specific response fields indicating
    total count, has_more status, or next page construction are not explicitly detailed
    in the provided documentation.
  - The GET /tiers endpoint supports pagination via optional query parameters page
    (integer) and per_page (integer). The response returns an array of tier objects
    in a data field, but no explicit next/previous fields or stopping conditions are
    documented.
  - 'The endpoint supports offset-based pagination with optional query parameters:
    page (integer) and per_page (integer). The response returns a data array containing
    workflow action objects.'
