auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.flowengineering.com/rest/v1/docs:
  - 'Authentication uses a two-step token exchange flow. First, obtain an Access Token
    by POST-ing to the /auth/exchange endpoint with a Refresh Token (found in Flow
    app Settings > Account > API) in the JSON body as refreshToken. Then pass the
    Access Token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme: Authorization:
    Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}.'
  - Exchange a refresh token for an access token via POST /auth/exchange. Send the
    refresh token in the request body (exact field name not specified in excerpt)
    with Content-Type application/json header. The response will contain an access
    token for subsequent API requests.
  - The Flow API uses Bearer token authentication. Send an Authorization header with
    the value "Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" for authenticated requests. To obtain an access
    token, exchange a valid refresh token (obtained from the Flow app settings menu)
    via POST to /auth/exchange with the refresh token in the JSON body field "refreshToken".
    The endpoint returns an "accessToken" and "expiresIn" fields.
  - The documentation shows a token refresh endpoint that returns an accessToken and
    expiresIn. This indicates OAuth2 or bearer token authentication where clients
    must obtain an accessToken (likely by sending a refreshToken) and use it for subsequent
    API requests. The accessToken should be sent in the Authorization header as a
    bearer token for authenticated requests to the API endpoints listed.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.flowengineering.com/rest/v1/docs:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset query parameters. The limit parameter specifies
    the maximum number of results per request (default and maximum values not specified),
    and offset specifies the starting position. Responses include a total field indicating
    total available results; continue paginating by incrementing offset until reaching
    the total.
  - The Flow API does not support pagination for most endpoints. Pagination is being
    added on an endpoint-by-endpoint basis and currently only exists for listing project
    systems, requirements, test cases, and test runs. However, the documentation does
    not specify the pagination parameters or response fields for these endpoints.
