auth_info:
- information_source; https://mrfields.net/auth-api/:
  - The authentication setup uses JWT tokens issued by Identity Server 4. Clients
    obtain tokens by authenticating with a client ID (clientid) and secret (nooneknows)
    to the Identity Server, then include the JWT token in the Authorization header
    of REST API requests. The API validates the token against the Identity Server
    issuer and returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized if validation fails.
  - 'To obtain a token, make a POST request to the IS4 `/connect/token` endpoint with
    Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded and body parameters: client_id,
    client_secret, scope, and grant_type set to client_credentials. Then use the returned
    token in subsequent API requests by including the Authorization header with value
    Bearer <token>.'
- information_source; https://mrfields.net/:
  - OAuth2 client credentials flow is used for authentication. To obtain a token,
    send a POST request to the identity server with grant_type=client_credentials,
    client_id, client_secret, and scope as form data. The response contains a JWT
    token that must be sent in subsequent API requests via the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}". API endpoints return HTTP 401 Unauthorized if the token is
    missing, invalid, expired, or malformed.
  - 'The REST API expects authentication via a JWT token sent in the `authorization`
    header. To obtain a token, make a POST request to the Identity Server `/connect/token`
    endpoint with client credentials: `client_id` set to the client ID (e.g., `clientid`),
    `client_secret` set to the secret (e.g., `nooneknows`), and `scope` set to the
    desired scope (e.g., `insidelayer`). The token response is a JWT with a configurable
    lifetime (default 3600 seconds, recommended 86400 for development). Include this
    JWT in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests; requests without
    a valid token receive HTTP 401 Unauthorized.'
