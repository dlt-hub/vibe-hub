notes:
- The REST API does not handle throttling internally and developers need to handle
  it in their code.
- A production environment is optimized for production traffic and is covered by the
  Sitecore SaaS Service Level Agreement.
- A headless module with the same name as the collection is created automatically
  when you create a new collection.
- We're using the Skate Park sample in the starter repository for this walkthrough
  as it contains a few components out-of-the-box.
- Ensure the file ends on a single new line or it will not compile.
- To use Forms on Pages, you need JSS version 21.6.0 or later.
- You must have technical knowledge of JSS to do the upgrade.
- A/B/n testing is supported only by the Cloud SDK, not by the Engage SDK.
- To view or create webhooks, you must have a developer or admin role.
- If the destination endpoint requires authentication, you must create an authorization
  item and assign it to the webhook.
- XM Cloud does not support resending a request when an error occurs at the destination
  endpoint.
- The default maximum time to send all webhooks in a particular request is 10 seconds.
- Sitecore regularly monitors the status of webhook execution and automatically disables
  a webhook that fails more than 10 consecutive attempts.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- The portal handles authentication for all your Sitecore DXP products.
- Improve your organization's security and increase productivity with single sign-on
  (SSO) and multi-factor authentication.
- The maximum supported repository size for XM Cloud deployments is 500MB. If your
  repository exceeds this limit, you won't be able to deploy your source code to XM
  Cloud.
- Connect Content Hub to more than 57 leading DAM, PIM, CMS, Stock, cloud-storage,
  and work-management providers worldwide.
- Automatic version control tracks every version of content and every associated revision,
  but not the metadata.
- Multistage projects consist of interconnected stages.
- Jobs are useful when there are no complex dependencies or strict time management
  requirements.
- To configure Content Hub, you must either be a superuser or have the necessary permissions
  granted to you through user group policies.
- Modifying the schema might affect many entities, causing them to be reprocessed
  in an immediate graph rebuild.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Sitecore
- API limits may apply depending on usage
- An organization can have multiple Organization Owners.
- The Content Hub ONE journey begins in the Sitecore Cloud portal where you select
  the Content Hub ONE instance.
- To use these, you need a valid API key
- Content Hub ONE supports 10 requests per second per tenant.
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Sitecore Search is preconfigured with experiences using the entities Content, Product,
  Category, and Store that display on a website or application integrated with Search
  as soon as indexing is complete.
- A Sitecore Search experience makes search and recommendation requests by entity.
- Widgets can be configured to appear on certain pages or all pages.
- All report data is refreshed daily at 4:00 AM UTC with events tracked the previous
  day.
- For sources that sync incrementally, entities that define store-level context will
  need to be ingested before entities that depend on that context.
- For sources that sync in batches, all entities will need to be ingested from the
  same source.
- This initial release supports English language only.
- If you do not have a subdomain, get an API key or access token.
- Export the data as a CSV or JSON output.
- Output is accessible for 35 days after export.
- You cannot update or delete an order using the Stream API.
- To ensure that the order is created, you must send the required events, in the correct
  order.
- Sitecore Personalize activates your data across all customer touchpoints to create
  seamless and consistent customer experiences.
- To get started, you need a Sitecore Send account and an API key.
- You must accept the invitation to join the organization within 7 days or the invitation
  will expire and you'll need to be invited again.
- It might take a few minutes for the profile picture to be updated in the Cloud Portal.
- Audit logging is enabled by default for Sitecore Cloud Portal and Sitecore Personalize.
