auth_info:
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/additional-resources/security:
  - The JigsawStack API requires an API key passed as the `x-api-key` header in requests.
    In the JavaScript and Python SDKs, the API key is provided via the `apiKey` or
    `api_key` parameter during initialization, which is then automatically included
    in request headers.
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/api-reference/ai/sentiment:
  - The API requires authentication via the x-api-key header, which must contain your
    JigsawStack API key. This key is required for all requests.
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/api-reference/ai/summary:
  - Your JigsawStack API key must be sent in the `x-api-key` header as a required
    string value.
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/api-reference/ai/translate/translate:
  - The API key must be passed to the JigsawStack client initialization as the apiKey
    parameter. This is a simple API key authentication scheme where the key is provided
    when instantiating the client library, which then handles sending it with requests
    (likely in an Authorization header or custom header, though the exact transmission
    method is not explicitly documented in this excerpt).
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/api-reference/ai/translate/image-translate:
  - API key authentication is required. Pass your API key to the JigsawStack client
    initialization via the apiKey parameter, or send it as an Authorization header
    in requests to the API endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://jigsawstack.com/docs/llms-full.txt:
  - Use query parameters limit (default 30, maximum number of prompts per request)
    and page (default 1, page number to return) to paginate through prompts. Stop
    when the returned results are fewer than the limit or when no more pages are available.
