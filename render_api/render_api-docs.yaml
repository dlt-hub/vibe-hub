  - All Render API requests require authentication via API key. The API key is created
    in the Render Dashboard Account Settings page and must be kept secret. Include
    the API key in request headers when making API calls to authenticate programmatically.
  - Render API uses Bearer token authentication. Send your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Bearer {api_key}" when making requests to https://api.render.com/v1
    endpoints. The API key is a secret credential that must not be shared or committed
    to version control; revoke and regenerate it in the Render Dashboard if compromised.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api-docs.render.com/reference/pagination:
  - Cursor-based pagination using the cursor query parameter. Pass the cursor value
    from the previous response to fetch the next set of results. Continue until no
    cursor is returned in the response, indicating all results have been fetched.
  - List endpoints use cursor-based pagination with query parameters limit (max results
    per page) and cursor (optional, for subsequent requests). Each response item includes
    a sibling cursor field; use the last item's cursor value in the next request's
    cursor parameter to fetch additional results.
