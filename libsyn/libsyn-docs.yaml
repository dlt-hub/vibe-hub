- An incubating project on the CNCF - Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- This can also cause problems for high performance or availability needs.
- But there is no technical reason distributed transactions are not possible.
- 'The author poses the question in the book: ''Do we even need transactions?'''
- 'The short answer is, yes sometimes, such as: Relational database systems where
  rows in tables link to rows in other tables, In non-relational systems when data
  is denormalized for ''object'' reasons, those records need to be updated in a single
  shot, or Indexes against tables in relational databases need to be updated at the
  same time as the underlying records in the tables.'
- These can be handled without database transactions, but error handling on the application
  side becomes much more difficult.
- Lack of isolation can cause concurrency problems.
- Handling errors and aborts ACID transactions that fail are easily retry-able.
- Some systems with leaderless replication follow the 'best effort' basis.
- The database will do what it can, and if something fails in the middle, it’ll leave
  anything that was written, meaning it won’t undo anything it already finished.
- This puts all the burden on the application to recover from an error or failure.
- The book calls out developers saying that we only like to think about the happy
  path and not worry about what happens when something goes wrong.
- The author also mentioned there are a number of ORM’s that don’t do transactions
  proud and rather than building in some retry functionality, if something goes wrong,
  it’ll just bubble an error up the stack.
- Even ACID transactions aren’t necessarily perfect.
- What if a transaction actually succeeded but the notification to the client got
  interrupted and now the application thinks it needs to try again, and MIGHT actually
  write a duplicate?
- If an error is due to 'overload', basically a condition that will continue to error
  constantly, this could cause an unnecessary load of retries against the database.
- Retrying may be pointless if there are network errors occurring.
- Retrying something that will always yield an error is also pointless, such as a
  constraint violation.
- There may be situations where your transactions trigger other actions, such as emails,
  SMS messages, etc. and in those situations you wouldn’t want to send new notifications
  every time you retry a transaction as it might generate a lot of noise.
- When dealing with multiple systems such as the previous example, you may want to
  use something called a two-phase commit.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Ludum Dare is a bi-annual game jam that’s been running for over 20 years now.
- 'Some simple concepts to grasp: If a commit has multiple parents, it’s a merge commit.'
- Git commits are immutable snapshots of the repository.
- Branches are named sequences of commits.
- Every object gets a unique id based on its content.
- Increasing reliability is always better for the service, right? Not necessarily.
- Users don’t typically notice the difference between very reliable and extremely
  reliable services.
- Hiring is hard and the SRE role competes with product teams.

- GitHub Actions is amazing because it's built around git!
- Great features comparable (or much better) than other CI/CD providers
- Great integration with a popular tool you might already be using
- This can be difficult and prone to errors trying to create all the combinations
  of locks AND this is a nasty leakage of your storage into your application
- Should be a last resort
- PERFECT DURABILITY DOES NOT EXIST
- If all your databases and backups somehow got destroyed at the same time, there’s
  absolutely nothing you could do.
- Great integration with Git.
- 'Workflows are triggered by events: push, pull request, etc.'
- OpenAI has recently announced a whopping 90% price reduction on their ChatGPT and
  Whisper API calls

- Branches are just names that point to a commit.
- Google has a strong bias for automation because of their scale.
- Reliability is the ultimate benefit to automation.
- No specific authentication or API configuration provided.
- They go on to say that anything that is not a READ operation should have CSRF tokens.
- NEVER use `GET` requests for state changing operations!
- OWASP dropped CSRF from the Top 10 in 2017 because the statistical data didn’t rank
  it highly enough to make the list.
- Ensure OAuth token is refreshed regularly.
- PagerDuty’s data classifications include General data, Business data, and Customer
  data.
- Customer data is expected to be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Business data includes operating data for the business, such as payroll, employee
  info, etc.
- PagerDuty alerts when a resource is created without encryption enabled.
- Vendor risk assessments should be performed prior to using third-party vendors.
- Scrum is not prescriptive. It's more like guardrails to a process.
- 'Projects are typically comprised of three basic things: time, cost, and scope.'
- Data models are one of the most important pieces of developing software.
- Software is typically written by stacking layers of modeling on top of each other.
- Small batch changes are inherently less risky.
- Automation needs to include operational changes, such as restarting services, that
  need to happen as well.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Datadog
- Uses GraphQL API for data retrieval
- Must be low-latency.
- Must support subscriptions.
- Contains various categories for coding and development resources
- Includes links to archives and categories for better navigation
- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform launched in 2018 that lets you define and automate
  workflows
- Workflows can run on GitHub-hosted virtual machines, or on your own servers
- GitHub Actions are free for standard Github runners in public repositories and self-hosted
  runners, private repositories get a certain amount of 'free' minutes and any overages
  are controlled by your spending limits
- Great free tier
- No API configuration provided
- A branch is just a named reference to a commit.
- Knowing the above two points, you actually don’t technically need branches or tags.
- Google aims for 100% reliability right? Wrong…
- SREs try to balance risk of unavailability with innovation and efficient service
  operations.
- Reliability is regarded as the primary focus of the SRE.
- SRE’s try to balance the risk of unavailability with innovation, new features, and
  efficient service operations by optimizing for the right balance of all.
- Protecting and auditing access to secrets.
- Secrets should NOT be stored in source control.
- Never allow a secret to be logged!
- The AI has been trained on billions of lines of open-source code but not strictly
  permissive licenses.
- Teams will need to have standard ways of dealing with situations.
- Resources include various books and tools related to DevOps.
- Focus on using telemetry for feedback and problem-solving.
- Implement continuous integration to improve team productivity.
- Learn what to look for in a code review while reviewing Google’s engineering practices.
- Some endpoints may have rate limits.
- Direct download available
- A majority of cost in software is maintaining it, not creating it in the first place.
- We SHOULD build applications to minimize the pain during the maintenance phase which
  involves using design principles.
- Good operations can overcome bad software, but great software cannot overcome bad
  operations.
- Must be low-latency. Less than 100 ms is ideal.
- Direct download links are available for each episode.
- Attended Build Guild Atlanta, a social gathering of developers.

- Requires setup of connected app in Twitter
- Some datasets may have privacy considerations
- Use rebase for local branches that don’t have other branches off it, otherwise use
  merge for anything else.
- Automation speeds processes up.
- Best to start thinking about automation in the design phase as it’s difficult to
  retrofit.
- Monitoring can become so complex that it becomes difficult to change, maintain,
  and it becomes fragile.
- Pages should be about novel events that have never occurred before.
- Monitoring complex systems is a major undertaking.
- SRE’s at Google seldom use tiered rule triggering.
- A very well and carefully defined metric of some aspect of the service or system.
