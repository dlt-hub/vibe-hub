notes:
- Never remove or rename existing fields without proper deprecation cycles.
- Use additive changes where possible.
- Swagger doesn’t recognize versions out of the box, so you’ll want to create separate
  Swagger documents representing each iteration.
- Performance hits are typical when generating Swagger docs with many API versions.
- Utilizing a pre-rendering strategy can enhance perceived speed by up to 35%.
- A study from Google indicates that every second of delay in loading can lead to
  a 20% reduction in user satisfaction.
- Regular vulnerability checks can be a straightforward way to reveal gaps that need
  urgent attention.
- A proactive stance on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities can safeguard your
  organization from harmful breaches.
- Regular intervals are essential, particularly after incidents or when significant
  changes in operations occur.
- Statistics from a recent cyber incident report indicate that 60% of organizations
  that fail to perform routine evaluations experience severe consequences within the
  year.
- Implement token-based authentication, commonly JWTs, to validate every request.
- Differentiate client errors (400-series) from server errors (500-series) precisely.
- Prioritize touch targets of at least 48x48 dp to minimize selection errors.
- Segment user personas precisely by gathering geographic, demographic, and psychographic
  data.
- Data shows that brands collecting and acting on real-time opinions see up to a 25%
  boost in repeat purchases within six months.
- Continuous feedback loops outperform one-off studies by keeping initiatives aligned
  with evolving user expectations.
- Embed quick feedback loops into daily workflows rather than treating them as additional
  tasks.
- Leverage technology platforms that consolidate and categorize incoming insights
  for easier analysis.
- Regularly communicate outcomes tied to shared observations–what was changed, why,
  and the impact achieved.
- Implementing AI features requires a data-driven approach and clear objectives.
- Data quality issues can significantly impact decision-making and operational efficiency.
- Prioritize user experience and security features in mobile banking applications.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Data shows that upselling can increase sales by up to 30%, making it a powerful
  strategy.
- A/B test can help determine the best placements and styles for displaying urgent
  offers to maximize conversions.
- Highlighting positive feedback next to upsell products fosters trust and increases
  the likelihood of additional purchases.
- Data validation cannot be an afterthought.
- Segmentation of stakeholders is crucial for targeted insight.
- Monitor rate limits closely. Exceeding thresholds set by transactional email providers
  triggers silent drops.
- Testing emails in sandbox modes can mask real-world obstacles like ISP throttling
  or recipient filtering.
- Verify the server's system clock. An incorrect time usually triggers SSL validation
  failures. Even a few minutes off can wreak havoc.
- Confirm the server supports modern TLS protocols. Older versions like TLS 1.0 or
  1.1 are deprecated and rejected by most clients. Aim for TLS 1.2 or 1.3 exclusively.
- Examine your certificate’s Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields. Missing domain
  entries lead to hostname mismatch errors.
- Some environments throw errors about “self-signed certificates” or “untrusted roots.”
  If you generated certificates locally for testing, that’s expected. Use trusted
  Certificate Authorities (CAs) in production. Alternatively, add your test CA’s root
  certificate to the client’s trust store, but beware this risks security outside
  controlled setups.
- Differences in TLS library implementations can explain why a perfectly valid certificate
  fails in one client but works in another. For instance, older cURL versions do not
  recognize newer root CAs without updating their CA bundles. Make sure your libraries
  and OS certificate stores receive timely updates–skipping those is a quick path
  to random SSL errors.
- Occasionally, reverse proxies or load balancers terminate SSL and then forward unencrypted
  traffic internally. Verify if your backend accepts plaintext HTTP or demands HTTPS
  from the proxy. Inconsistent configurations might trigger handshake failures or
  unexpected errors in logs.
- Some firewalls and antivirus solutions intercept SSL to scan traffic, generating
  custom certificates on the fly. If these certificates are not trusted by your client,
  connections will break. Check firewall logs and whitelist essential services if
  this happens.
- Replace expired or incomplete certificates, update TLS protocols, confirm hostname
  matches, and keep your trust stores current. These steps address over 90% of SSL/TLS
  complications observed in mail and API communications.
- Integrating graphical interpretation within modern information repositories accelerates
  insight extraction by 40% compared to numeric reports alone.
- Adoption enhances data storytelling, making it easier to support strategic initiatives
  or secure stakeholder buy-in.
- Concurrency with goroutines is more than just parallelism–it's about orchestrating
  asynchronous tasks safely and efficiently.
- Deadlocks occur when two or more goroutines wait indefinitely for each other to
  release resources.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Always check the status codes before processing anything.
- Implementing proper error handling and conditional rendering based on request states
  is crucial for user experience.
