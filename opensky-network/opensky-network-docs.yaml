notes:
- If a --serve-port option is set, a REST API is set on 0.0.0.0 on the port of your
  choice.
- By default, all the history remains accessible until the program exits but this
  behaviour can drain your RAM memory quickly if you see many aircraft.
- Log in to your OpenSky account and visit the Account page in order to create a new
  API client and retrieve your client_id and client_secret.
- Anonymous users can only get the most recent state vectors.
- OpenSky users can retrieve data of up to 1 hour in the past.
- The information to display is provided by the tangram REST API, which provides the
  list of receivers and their positions on the /sensors endpoint.
