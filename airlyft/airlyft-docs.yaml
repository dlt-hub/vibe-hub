notes:
- Campaign Visibility options include Public, Private, and Public Explorable.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The 'Public Explorable' visibility cannot be set from the campaign details page
  but is automatically set when the campaign is 'Public and Announce'.
- AirLyft analytics can sometimes show data that is slightly different from participants,
  this usually happens as the analytics system gets blocked by adblockers & such.
- Campaign details can only be updated when the campaign is in 'Scheduled' state.
- A campaign can only be deleted when the status of that particular campaign is in
  a DRAFT state.
- AirLyft makes a best-effort to stop Bots from participating in your campaigns but
  as you might understand that it is a continuous battle to keep your giveaways safe
  & we do not provide gaurantees on the same.
- The Task Frequency setting determines how often a user can complete a task.
- The Task Conditions settings define whether a user is eligible to perform the task.
- You can set multiple conditions and specify whether all conditions must be met or
  if any one condition is enough.
- This document is in progress, for instant help
- The AirLyft Team is there to help you. AirLyft is a platform to run marketing events,
  campaigns, quests and automatically distribute NFTs or Tokens as rewards.
- Your XP, Fuel etc. will not be merged and if you have performed a quest already
  then you will not be able to perform the same quest again from the same account
  etc.
- To integrate Zapier with your AirLyft campaigns, you'll need to set up both your
  AirLyft account and your Zapier account.
- The Participation webhook will only be integrated with the Campaign.
- The Subscribe Newsletter webhook will only be integrated with Email Quest.
- Communities can choose between two distribution methods for token allocation.
- You can use these indexing protocol integrations to put conditions on the on-chain
  stored data and create in-depth decentralized actions.
- Due to recent Instagram API policy changes, validating actions won't be possible.
- The probabilities must add up to 100%. This setup ensures that different rewards
  have different chances of being won, creating an exciting and dynamic experience
  for participants.
- A REFERRAL IS ONLY CONSIDERED AS SUCCESSFUL IF THE REFERRED INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES
  AT LEAST ANYONE TASK IN THE EVENT HE/SHE IS BEING REFERRED FOR.
- AirLyft integrates with any system that provides REST API access.
- AirLyft does not read any group/channel messages, we also do not read any user PII
  through this bot.
- This bot will not send any message to your group/channel and you can revoke all
  access to this bot to just verify participation.
- Projects can create actions on Twitter for community engagement
- Supports collecting wallet addresses for EVM, Dotsama, Cosmos, and Solana blockchains.
- These EVM-based tasks support conditions on all sorts of tokens such as ERC 20,
  ERC 721, and ERC 1155.
- In accordance with Google's Youtube privacy policies, please note that we won't
  be able to verify if a particular user has actually subscribed, followed, or liked
  your Youtube post or channel as they don't allow read information to third party
  applications.
- YouTube doesn't allow anything that artificially increases the number of views,
  likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up
  videos to unsuspecting viewers. AirLyft can only help you redirect to their account
  but won't verify it.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- 'Bad Request: User Not Found'
- Could not verify. The same account/IP might have been used for verifying the same
  quest already.
