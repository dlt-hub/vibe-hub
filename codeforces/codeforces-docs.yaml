auth_info:
- information_source; https://codeforces.com/apiHelp:
  - API authentication uses an API key and HMAC-SHA512 signature scheme. Include apiKey
    and time parameters in the request URL, then compute apiSig as sha512Hex(rand/methodName?param1=value1&param2=value2#secret)
    where parameters are sorted lexicographically and rand is a random number prepended
    to the hash input. The apiSig parameter must be appended to the query string.
    For unauthenticated requests, omit apiKey, time, and apiSig parameters.
  - 'API key authentication with HMAC-SHA512 signature. Add three parameters to requests:
    apiKey (the key value), time (current Unix timestamp, must be within 5 minutes
    of server time), and apiSig (first 6 random characters followed by SHA-512 hex
    hash of the string <rand>/<methodName>?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN#<secret>).
    Anonymous requests are allowed for public data only.'
