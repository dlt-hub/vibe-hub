notes:
- RP are required to implement token validation by fetching the Sign with Singpass
  JWKS
- RP are required to download the document immediately as the signed_doc_url will
  expire in 2 minutes.
- Signatures made using Sign with Singpass are regarded as Secure Electronic Signatures
  (SES) under the Electronic Transactions Act 2010 (ETA).
- Using Sign allows organisations to do away with wet-ink (physical) signatures, saving
  cost and time.
- Signatures created through Sign are regarded as Secure Electronic Signatures under
  the Electronics Transaction Act 2010 (ETA)
- Sign with Singpass is currently free of charge, both for organisations integrating
  with us, as well as for signers.
- The first QR code you scan is to verify your identity with Singpass and log in to
  the Sign portal.
- The second QR code you scan is for you to perform the signing of document.
- Please ensure that the document has not been modified since your signature has been
  created, as this will invalidate the signature.
- Sign with Singpass should not be used to create Secure Electronic Signatures in
  relation to certain excluded matters.
- You will receive a confirmation email when your request to onboard has been approved.
- By signing with Singpass, you create secure digital signatures that are highly resistant
  to forgery and tampering.
- Using Sign allows organisations to do away with wet-ink (physical) signatures, saving
  cost and time both for the organisation and the signatory.
- Relying Parties (RPs) will send the document, redirect the user to Sign portal,
  and receive notifications via webhook.
- DSAPs must implement and expose a webhook endpoint to accept information from Singpass.
- Singpass will sign all JWTs sent to DSAPs webhook with its signing key.
- DSAPs are expected to verify the validity of the user’s certificate status against
  National Certificate Authority (NCA).
- The new staging domain stg-app.singpass.gov.sg will only take effect from 18 Mar
  2025.
- 'Under the First Schedule to the Electronics Transaction Act 2010 (ETA), the following
  use cases are excluded from the operation of Part II of the ETA. Sign with Singpass
  should not be used to create Secure Electronic Signatures in relation to these matters:
  The creation or execution of a will, The creation, performance or enforcement of
  an indenture, declaration of trust or power of attorney, Any contract for the sale
  or other disposition of immovable property, or Any interest in such property.'
- Each signing session allows for one user to affix up to 5 signatures within one
  PDF document.
- Each signing session has a validity of 30 mins.
- The query parameters will be changed soon.
- We only accept one redirect URL per application onboarded.
- RP are required to respond to the webhook request within 2 seconds.
- The JWKS must be hosted on a publicly accessible URL.
- Keys may be returned in random sequence or rotated for security enhancement.
- The link provided is valid for 30 minutes.
errors:
- RP are required to respond to the webhook request within 2 seconds.
- If you reject the signing, the Sign Portal will continue to stay in 'pending sign'
  mode.
