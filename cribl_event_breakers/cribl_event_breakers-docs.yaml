auth_info:
- information_source; https://sandbox.cribl.io/coursedocs/rest/docs/7_pagination:
  - 'Bearer tokens are required for authentication on protected REST API endpoints.
    Include the token in the Authorization header with the format "Authorization:
    Bearer {token}", where {token} is your actual bearer token value.'
- information_source; https://sandbox.cribl.io/coursedocs/rest/docs/8_authentication:
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Obtain a token by sending a POST request
    to the `/login` endpoint with JSON body containing username and password fields,
    then provide the token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to private
    endpoints.
  - The API uses bearer token authentication. First, obtain a token by sending a POST
    request to the login endpoint with JSON body containing username and password
    fields. The response returns a token field with a bearer token that expires in
    5 minutes. Include this token in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>"
    for all subsequent private endpoint requests. If you receive a 401 Unauthorized
    response, regenerate the token.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://sandbox.cribl.io/coursedocs/rest/docs/7_pagination:
  - Pagination uses RFC 5988 Web Linking with Link headers containing rel="next" and
    rel="self". Response includes pagination object with size, limit, offset, and
    total fields. Navigate pages using the next link from the Link header until no
    further next link is returned or next link matches the self link.
  - Pagination uses an offset-based scheme with query parameter `offset` set to the
    value of the `next` response attribute. The response body contains `next` (next
    page offset) and `more` (boolean flag), with pagination stopping when `more ===
    false`. Additionally, some endpoints return pagination info in response headers
    via a `nextLink` header containing the next page URL.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with query parameters `size`, `limit`, and
    `offset`. The response includes a `pagination` object with `next` and `previous`
    fields containing the relative path for the next/previous page. Stop paginating
    when the `next` field is no longer returned in the response.
  - The API uses offset-based pagination with response body indicators. The `offset`
    query parameter controls pagination (optional, starting at 0), and the response
    contains a `pagination` object with `next` (next offset value) and `more` (boolean
    indicating if more pages exist). Continue paginating by using the `next` value
    as the `offset` parameter in subsequent requests until `more` returns false.
  - Use query parameter `page` (zero-based index) and `limit` for page size. Response
    contains `pagination.page`, `pagination.size`, and `pagination.total` fields.
    Increment `page` until calculated page number exceeds total pages based on item
    count and page size.
