- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- The algo update list now also includes releases for AI Mode and other AI features

  by Google, or suspected.
- We will no longer be reporting in great detail on each tweak to the algorithm as
  our conclusions are almost always to improve overall quality.

- Understanding E-E-A-T is essential for improving content quality.
- The very first characteristic of a low quality page listed in the QRG is a lack
  of E-A-T.
- Attributes are pieces of information. These can be used in programs that communicate
  with Google's resources.
