  : - The BarTender Cloud API uses bearer token authentication. Send the bearer token
      in the Authorization header of your requests. If you receive an Unauthorized
      error, retrieve a fresh token from BarTender Cloud and update it in your application,
      as tokens may need refreshing even if not expired.
- information_source; https://support.seagullsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053982393-Print-Portal-REST-API:
  - Authentication requires username and password credentials submitted via the Swagger
    UI "Try it out" interface. Upon successful authentication, the API returns an
    authentication token that must be used for subsequent REST API calls.
  - 'Authentication uses token-based Bearer tokens. To obtain a token, send a POST
    request to {Print Portal Base URL}/BarTender/api/v1/Authenticate with a JSON body
    containing userName and password fields. The response includes a token property.
    For all subsequent API requests, include an Authorization header with the format
    "Authorization: Bearer <TokenString>".'
