  - Basic authentication is required for this endpoint. Credentials must be sent using
    HTTP Basic Auth (username and password encoded in base64 in the Authorization
    header). The token parameter is passed in the URL path, and the request body contains
    scopes (required array of strings defining authorized methods/domains/endpoints)
    and ttl (optional integer in seconds, maximum one year).
  - Basic authentication is required for token management endpoints. Send credentials
    using HTTP Basic Auth (base64-encoded username:password in the Authorization header).
    The token endpoint is at https://oauth.openapi.it/token (production) or https://test.oauth.openapi.it/token
    (sandbox). Tokens include scopes that define API access permissions and have expiration
    times (expire field indicates Unix timestamp).
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    with the format "Authorization: Basic REPLACE_BASIC_AUTH", where REPLACE_BASIC_AUTH
    is a base64-encoded string of username:password. The token is passed as a path
    parameter in the URL.'
  - 'Basic authentication is required. Send credentials via the Authorization header
    using the Basic auth scheme (format: Authorization: Basic REPLACE_BASIC_AUTH,
    where REPLACE_BASIC_AUTH is the base64-encoded username:password). This applies
    to token deletion and scope listing endpoints.'
