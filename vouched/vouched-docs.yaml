notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- API access and data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2.
- Submit Job endpoint has a payload limit of 20MB.
- Each account receives 50 Free IDs on sign-up, which can be used for testing purposes.
- Browser permissions for the camera require an https host.
- The Vouched function and subsequent calls to .mount() should only happen once per
  verification session.
- Sessions are uniquely identified by the time limited token property.
- In order to enable the Mobile Handoff functionality, set the crossDevice, crossDeviceSMS,
  and crossDeviceQRCode parameters to true.
- The handoff forwards the verification to a Vouched hosted site.
- Allow camera access to perform identity verification
- Vouched enforces a rate limiting policy on API requests to maintain the stability
  and reliability of our identity verification services.
- All API endpoints are subject to the same rate limit.
- Please reach out to use if you need a higher rate limit, support@vouched.id.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) can be used to help protect your account from unauthorized
  access by requiring you to enter an additional code when you sign in.
- 'Jobs have various statuses: Approved, Failed, Active, Removed, Warning.'
- Only one of each key type can be active at a given time. Recreating a key will immediately
  invalidate the previous key.
- 'Common warnings are: data-checks/crosscheck error, expired document, DLV error,
  and AML error.'
- Customers can validate driver’s licenses, learner’s permits, and government-issued
  IDs with government and proprietary data sources in 45 US states and Washington,
  D.C.
- US territories defined as insular areas (such as Puerto Rico) are not supported.
- The CrossCheck feature might have an additional cost, depending on your identity
  package.
- Dark Web is currently unavailable. Please reach out to Vouched Support for any questions.
- The Dark Web feature can be turned on as an add-on to CrossCheck only.
- Reverification is only supported in the JS Plugin and 'avant' theme currently.
- Live eCBSV verifications are only allowed to be performed on real users.
- For every live verification, it is required to collect consent from the end user.
- All three features are part of our Advance and Premier packages.
- 'Payload Limits: The Submit Job endpoint has a payload limit of 20MB.'
