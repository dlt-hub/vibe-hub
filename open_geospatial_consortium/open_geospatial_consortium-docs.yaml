auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ogc.org/per/22-018.html:
  - Access requires a Bearer token obtained from https://ogc.demo.secure-dimensions.de/token-app/.
    The token is passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}". Additionally,
    a key_challenge query parameter with value "123" is required in the request URL.
  - Access tokens are sent via Bearer HTTP header field in the Authorization header,
    with future migration planned to DPoP HTTP header field for proof of possession.
    The DPoP header carries a JWT token demonstrating possession, while the Authorization
    header contains the DPoP access token. Both headers are required when using DPoP
    authentication.
  - Data Encryption with JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) is supported for
    the OGC API-Records GET /items/{item-id} endpoint. Clients must generate RSA key
    pairs (public and private keys) with a key ID (kid) and use parameter set to "enc",
    then export and use the public key for encryption as specified in RFC 7515. The
    encrypted payload is transmitted as application/jose content type.
- information_source; https://docs.ogc.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html:
  - Mapbox API requires an access token passed as a query parameter named access_token.
    Include your access token in all requests as ?access_token=<your access token>
    appended to the URL.
  - Mapbox web services require an access token for authentication. The token must
    be passed as a query parameter named access_token in GET requests to endpoints
    like https://api.mapbox.com/v4/{mapid}/{lon},{lat},{z}/{width}x{height}.{format}?access_token=<your
    access token>. Obtain your access token from your Mapbox account.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.ogc.org/per/22-018.html:
  - numberMatched indicates the total number of matching records (39), while numberReturned
    indicates how many records are returned in the current response (10). To paginate
    through results, use limit and offset query parameters to control page size and
    starting position, stopping when numberReturned is less than the requested limit
    or when all numberMatched records have been retrieved.
