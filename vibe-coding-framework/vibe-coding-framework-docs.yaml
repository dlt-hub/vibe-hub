notes:
- Must implement OWASP security best practices
- Uses JWT for authentication with refresh tokens
- Requires secure user authentication
- Focus on minimal, high-value documentation that directly supports maintainability
  and knowledge transfer.
- Regular assessment and refinement of your approach will ensure maximum benefit as
  both AI capabilities and your team's expertise evolve.
- Vibe programming describes the practice of using AI tools to generate code based
  on high-level, natural language prompts rather than writing every line manually.
- This approach operates at a higher level of abstraction, allowing developers to
  focus on what they want to achieve rather than the precise implementation details.
- AI tools should enhance human capabilities rather than replace human judgment or
  understanding.
- 'Verification before trust: thorough verification of AI-generated code is essential.'
- 'Maintainability first: prioritize long-term maintainability over rapid initial
  development.'
- 'Security by design: integrate security considerations throughout the development
  process.'
- 'Knowledge preservation: capture and share understanding for long-term success.'
- 'Continuous learning: embrace ongoing evaluation and refinement of practices.'
- 'Balanced pragmatism: adapt the framework to diverse project needs and constraints.'
- The framework provides a systematic methodology for crafting effective prompts.
- Verification Protocols are critical safeguards in the Vibe Coding Framework.
- AI-generated code presents distinct security challenges
- Requires setup of connected app in api
- Document reasoning and decision rationale, not just implementation details.
- Create documentation immediately after code generation while context and understanding
  are fresh.
- Standardize documentation formats for consistency and completeness.
- Connect documentation to verification results to provide confidence in implementation.
- Use diagrams, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams to explain complex workflows.
- Apply the same review standards to documentation as you do to code.
- Invest more documentation effort in high-risk, complex, or critical components.
- Document challenges, insights, and effective prompt strategies for team learning.
- Refactoring is critical when working with AI-generated code.
- 'Over-engineering: Refactoring to patterns that are unnecessarily complex for the
  problem'
- 'Incomplete refactoring: Leaving portions of the code in the original state, creating
  inconsistency'
- 'Functionality changes: Inadvertently changing behavior during refactoring'
- 'Premature optimization: Focusing on performance before ensuring correctness and
  clarity'
- 'Insufficient testing: Not validating that refactored code preserves original functionality'
- Individual developers can implement the framework quickly without team consensus.
- Framework can be tailored to specific needs and workflows.
- Establish governance, pilot implementations, and initial standards.
- Create an AI-Assisted Development Steering Committee.
- Effective review of AI-generated code requires both technical rigor and contextual
  understanding.
- AI-generated code requires specialized security verification to address unique vulnerabilities
  and ensure robust protection.
- Protection against credential stuffing
- Defense against session fixation
- Prevention of session hijacking
- Protection against cross-site request forgery
- Defense against account enumeration
- Protection against phishing
- Collaboration workflows provide structured approaches for teams to work effectively
  with AI-assisted code generation.
- Site is still in beta and will be versioned to 1.0.0 on 20-April-2025
- The roadmap is open to community involvement.
- Patch releases occur monthly for minor improvements.
