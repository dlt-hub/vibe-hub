auth_info:
- information_source; https://apichallenges.eviltester.com/apichallenges/solutions/get/get-todo-404:
  - The API requires an `X-CHALLENGER` header containing a challenger GUID value to
    be included with requests. This header is used to track and identify the challenger
    session across API calls.
- information_source; https://apichallenges.eviltester.com/docs:
  - POST /secret/token requires basic auth to obtain a token, which is then used as
    the X-AUTH-TOKEN header for accessing /secret/note endpoints. The token is sent
    in the X-AUTH-TOKEN header for GET and POST requests to /secret/note, with POST
    requests also requiring a JSON payload containing the note field.
  - The documentation mentions an X-CHALLENGER guid header used across multiple endpoints
    (/challenger, /challenger/:guid, /challenger/database/:guid) for challenger tracking
    and session management. The X-CHALLENGER guid should be sent as a request header
    to create, restore, and manage challenger sessions and their associated todo data.
- information_source; https://apichallenges.eviltester.com/practice-sites:
  - Some endpoints require authentication via HTTP Bearer Token obtained after logging
    in as a user. The Notes API requires user registration and login, then passing
    the returned token as an X-AUTH-TOKEN header. DELETE endpoints may require admin
    user login. The Toolshop API uses Bearer Token authentication after user login,
    while the Notes API uses X-AUTH-TOKEN header authentication after registration
    and login.
