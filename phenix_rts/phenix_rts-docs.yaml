auth_info:
- information_source; https://phenixrts.com/docs/api/:
  - Authentication is performed by including applicationId and secret in the JSON
    request body. Send a PUT request to /pcast/stream/playlist with Content-Type application/json,
    and include "applicationId" and "secret" fields in the JSON payload along with
    the streamId parameter.
  - 'Authentication is required and supports two methods: HTTP Authorization header
    with Basic auth (combining applicationId and secret as applicationId:secret, then
    base64 encoded) or an alternative method not fully detailed in this excerpt. Send
    credentials via the Authorization header as Authorization: Basic <base64(applicationId:secret)>.'
  - 'Authentication tokens are generated via POST request to /pcast/auth using applicationId
    and secret credentials in the JSON request body. The response provides a token
    that is subsequently used to authenticate API requests.


    Request endpoint: POST https://pcast.phenixrts.com/pcast/auth


    Required request headers: Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json


    Required JSON body fields: applicationId (your application ID), secret (your application
    secret)


    Optional JSON body field: capabilities (array of capability strings)'
  - Authorization header using Basic authentication with base64-encoded credentials
    in the format applicationId:secret. Send the Authorization header with value "Basic"
    followed by the base64-encoded applicationId and secret separated by a colon.
  - Authorization header with Bearer token scheme. Send a PUT request with the Authorization
    header set to "Bearer <edgeAuthToken>" where edgeAuthToken is obtained separately.
    The token must be included in the request to the pcast/:tenancy/stream/publish/uri/:type
    endpoint.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://phenixrts.com/docs/api/:
  - The API uses limit-based pagination with optional cursor-like parameters. The
    limit query parameter (optional) controls the number of messages returned per
    request. The beforeMessageId and afterMessageId query parameters (both optional)
    provide cursor-like bounds for message ranges, allowing you to fetch messages
    before or after specific message IDs to navigate through pages.
  - The `/pcast/room/<urlEncodedRoomId>/messages` endpoint uses query parameter pagination
    with limit (optional, default not specified), beforeMessageId (optional, upper
    bound), and afterMessageId (optional, lower bound) to control message retrieval.
    The response structure and navigation fields are not documented in the provided
    excerpt.
