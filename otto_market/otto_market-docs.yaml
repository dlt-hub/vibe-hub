auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/about-the-api/api-guides/:
  - All endpoints require OAuth 2.0 authentication. Include the HTTP Authorization
    header with value Bearer followed by an access token obtained via client credential
    flow or authorization code flow. Scopes must be requested during token acquisition
    and correspond to specific API interfaces you intend to access.
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Add an HTTP Authorization header with
    the value Bearer followed by a JWT token to access all endpoints.
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/about-the-api/sandbox/:
  - A valid authorization token must be sent with all endpoints. For specific authentication
    options and how to obtain or configure the token, refer to the Developer's Guide
    authentication section.
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/about-the-api/use-cases/:
  - You must authenticate to the OTTO Market API by posting your credentials to fetch
    an access token. Refer to the getting-started documentation for the specific authentication
    mechanism and credential format required.
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/api-docs/:
  - API uses bearer token authentication. Send credentials in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer REPLACE_BEARER_TOKEN". The bearer token must be included for all authenticated
    endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/about-the-api/api-guides/:
  - Pagination uses a link-based navigation scheme where a limit parameter controls
    maximum entities returned per call. The response includes a links array with a
    next link (containing href and rel="next") to fetch subsequent pages; if the next
    link is absent, no more records exist.
- information_source; https://api.otto.market/docs/api-docs/:
  - Cursor based pagination is supported. Use the limit query parameter to control
    the number of returned orders (maximum 128 per request). Use cursor from the response
    to request the next page by passing it in the next request.
  - Cursor-based pagination is provided via next link in responses. Request parameters
    are limit (integer, default value not specified) and page (integer, default value
    not specified). The endpoint is limited to maximum 50 results per page.
  - 'Cursor-based pagination is used for the availability quantities endpoint. The
    response includes a "links" array with a "rel": "next" object containing an "href"
    with a cursor parameter. Use the cursor value from the next link in subsequent
    requests to fetch additional pages.'
  - Cursor-based pagination is used with query parameters limit (integer, optional,
    deprecated) and cursor (string, optional). The response returns a maximum of 200
    items per request. If more items exist, a cursor field is included in the response
    to retrieve the next batch of results using that cursor value in the subsequent
    request.
