notes:
- Ideal for disconnected or air-gapped deployments, with no need for internet access
  or external cloud services.
- You can use basic authentication or JWT authentication to access the NGINX Instance
  Manager REST API.
- Pagination is enabled by default with 100 events returned per page.
- Make sure you’ve completed the necessary tasks before starting the setup.
- Manage NGINX configurations with API requests
- Authentication can be done using either API Token or API Certificate.
- In NGINX Plus Release 12 and earlier, dynamic configuration was performed with the
  upstream_conf handler. That API (and the extended status API) are now deprecated
  in favor of the NGINX Plus API.
- Changes made with the API are stored only in the shared memory zone.
- Do not modify the state file directly.
- NGINX Plus REST API available since NGINX Plus Release 14
- HTTP Basic authentication can be combined with other access restriction methods.
- NGINX and F5 NGINX Plus can authenticate each request to your website with an external
  server or service.
- Such type of authentication allows implementing various authentication schemes,
  such as multifactor authentication, or allows implementing LDAP or OAuth authentication.
- The request body is discarded for authentication subrequests.
