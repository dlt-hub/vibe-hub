auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.bytescale.com/docs/sdks/javascript:
  - Bytescale uses JWT-based authentication via an auth API endpoint. Your client
    calls beginAuthSession with an authUrl that returns a signed JWT (RS256), and
    authHeaders function that provides credentials (e.g. authorization header) required
    by your auth endpoint. The public key certificate must be registered in the Bytescale
    Dashboard. The JWT must be plain text with content-type text/plain and include
    exactly 2 "." characters.
- information_source; https://www.bytescale.com/docs/sdks/node-js:
  - 'Bytescale uses JWT-based authentication where you provide an auth URL that returns
    a signed JWT token. The JWT must be RS256-signed, include a public key certificate
    registered in the Bytescale Dashboard, and be returned as plain text with a ''content-type:
    text/plain'' header and 200 status code. The authHeaders function allows you to
    pass custom headers (such as an ''authorization'' header) to your auth endpoint,
    and the accountId parameter is required to identify your Bytescale account.'
- information_source; https://www.bytescale.com/docs/upload-api/BasicUpload:
  - 'Add an Authorization header to your request using one of two methods: prefix
    "Bearer " to your API key for the header value, or use HTTP basic authorization
    with username "apikey" and your API key as the password. For advanced authentication
    options, see https://www.bytescale.com/docs/auth.'
  - 'Authorization requires a Bearer token passed in the Authorization header. Send
    the API key as "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" in the request headers.'
- information_source; https://www.bytescale.com/docs/upload-api/FormDataUpload:
  - 'Add an Authorization header using one of two methods: either prefix "Bearer "
    to your API key, or use HTTP basic authorization with username "apikey" and your
    API key as the password. The Content-Type header must be set to "multipart/form-data".
    Optionally include X-Upload-Metadata as a JSON object header for storing file
    metadata.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.bytescale.com/docs/folder-api/ListFolder:

    the response in the next request to retrieve subsequent pages. Pagination is complete
    when the response includes isPaginationComplete=true.
