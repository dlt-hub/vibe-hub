notes:
- Hypothesis tests are defined using @given and a strategy.
- Use the .example() method to see generated values.
- Default is 100 examples.
- By default, this is a DirectoryBasedExampleDatabase in the local .hypothesis directory.
- Inputs from @example do not shrink.
- Prefer @example over the database for correctness.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Health checks can be disabled by settings.suppress_health_check.
- The database is best thought of as a cache that you never need to invalidate.
- A Hypothesis database is a simple mapping of bytes to sets of bytes.
- The default max examples is 100.
- The default stateful step count is 50.
- The default deadline is 200 milliseconds.
- The more examples you run, the better this technique works.
- A settings object can be applied as a decorator to a test function.
- You must provide `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable.
- If the repository is private, it’s necessary for the token to have `repo` scope
  in the case of a classic token, or `actions:read` in the case of a fine-grained
  token.
- We recommend avoiding TransactionTestCase unless you really have to run each test
  case in a database transaction.
- If you are using TransactionTestCase, you may need to use @settings(suppress_health_check=[HealthCheck.too_slow])
  to avoid a HealthCheck error due to slow example generation.
- Must provide GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable.
- If the repository is private, the token must have repo scope for classic tokens
  or actions:read for fine-grained tokens.
- The database setting is used by fuzzing mode - adding failures to the database to
  be replayed when you next run your tests is our preferred reporting mechanism and
  response to the ‘fuzzer taming’ problem.
- The verbosity and stateful_step_count settings work as usual.
- The tzdata package is required on Windows
- pip install hypothesis[zoneinfo] installs it, if and only if needed
- There is quite a lot of variation between pandas versions.
- Hypothesis is currently tested against and confirmed working with every Pandas minor
  version from 1.1 through to 2.2.
- Several array libraries have more library-specific strategies.
- Hypothesis creates saved models. This will run inside your testing transaction when
  using the test runner, but if you use the dev console this will leave debris in
  your database.
- Currently from_lark does not support grammars that need custom lexing.
- Strategies in this module require the `hypothesis[lark]` extra, via `pip install
  hypothesis[lark]`.
- Strategies in this module require the `hypothesis[pytz]` extra, via `pip install
  hypothesis[pytz]`.
- Strategies in this module require the `hypothesis[dateutil]` extra, via `pip install
  hypothesis[dateutil]`.
- Legal questions? While the ghostwriter fragments and logic is under the MPL-2.0
  license like the rest of Hypothesis, the output from the ghostwriter is made available
  under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public domain dedication, so you can use it
  without any restrictions.
- This feature requires the `hypothesis[codemods]` extra, via `pip install hypothesis[codemods]`.
- This feature requires the `hypothesis[dpcontracts]` extra, via `pip install hypothesis[dpcontracts]`.
- Uses json lines format for observations
- Pytest will load the plugin automatically if Hypothesis is installed
- This feature requires the `hypothesis[codemods]` [extra](../extras.html), via `pip
  install hypothesis[codemods]`.
- For new projects, we recommend using either [deal](https://pypi.org/project/deal/)
  or [icontract](https://pypi.org/project/icontract/) and [icontract-hypothesis](https://pypi.org/project/icontract-hypothesis/)
  over [dpcontracts](https://pypi.org/project/dpcontracts/).
- Improves input validation for several strategies in our pandas extra, so that they
  raise a helpful InvalidArgument rather than OverflowError.
- When a test is executed concurrently from multiple threads, HealthCheck.too_slow
  is now disabled.
- HealthCheck.differing_executors is no longer raised if a test is executed by different
  executors from different threads.
- DeadlineExceeded is now disabled when a test is executed concurrently from multiple
  threads.
- Improves the string representation of characters() in some cases.
- Cap the length of bytestrings collected as part of the constants-collection feature.
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- the old way still works, but it's more verbose.
- This release drops support for Python 2, which has passed its end of life date.
- If you have somehow ended up with Hypothesis 5.0 on Python 2, you need to update
  your packaging stack to pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2.
- Then pip uninstall hypothesis && pip install hypothesis will get you back to a compatible
  version.
- No new features in this major version, only removal of deprecated features.
- This release improves validation of numeric bounds for some strategies.
- This release cleans up all of the legacy that accrued in the course of Hypothesis
  1.0.
- In general your tests should have got faster.
- This release could also be called 1.0-RC1.
- It contains a teeny tiny bugfix, but the real point of this release is to declare
  feature freeze.
