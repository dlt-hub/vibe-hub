notes:
- Currently, DEXes are migrating to Algebra Integral.
- Algebra Integral combines the precision of concentrated liquidity with the freedom
  of modular design.
- The design of Algebra Integral prioritizes robust, production-grade security.
- Every line of code is first reviewed by our internal experts and covered with all
  necessary tests to ensure safe, predictable behavior.
- Our smart contracts have already undergone multiple independent audits by leading
  firms, with ongoing reviews planned as the ecosystem evolves.
- Our brand is designed to reflect innovation & modularity
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- With modularity, DEX builders no longer need to fork or rebuild to experiment, scale,
  or pivot.
- Algebra offers hands-on support to help you launch, scale, and differentiate your
  DEX—from day one.
- Access detailed, well-structured technical documentation to help your engineers
  move fast and build with confidence.
- 'This section, along with "Price Ranges & Liquidity Strategies" and "Liquidity Provisioning:
  Tutorials & FAQs", serves as a general user guide for any DEX powered by Algebra.'
- Designed to be easily adapted and branded by individual DEX teams
- This documentation is dedicated to the new version of Algebra - Algebra Integral.
- The new version of the protocol contains a lot of new functions and capabilities,
  as well as various kinds of optimizations.
- The new version does not support tokens whose total supply can exceed '2^128 - 1'.
- The functionality of each Algebra Integral pool can be expanded through various
  plugins.
- Plugin developers can create an unlimited number of pools with different plugins.
