  - Abnormal REST API requires an API access token obtained from the Abnormal Portal
    (Settings > Integrations > Abnormal REST API). The token must be sent with API
    requests, and IP safelisting must be configured in the Portal to restrict API
    access to your organization's IP addresses only.
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include the access token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer << ACCESS_TOKEN >>". The token must be obtained
    separately and used across all API requests to the Abnormal REST API endpoints.'
