notes:
- OAuth requires developers to register their apps with Neurosity
- Requires setup of account with Neurosity via console.neurosity.co
- Device ID, email, and password must be stored in .env file
- If your device is claimed by another user, you will not be able to authenticate
  with it.
- If your device is unclaimed, you will not be able to authenticate with it, you will
  need to claim it on console.neurosity.co.
- Only request scopes that you inted to use in your app.
- Calm will take up to 16 seconds to initialize.
- Focus is a probability from 0.0 to 1.0.
- Focus will take up to 16 seconds to fully initialize.
- Uses OAuth2 with email and password for authentication.
- Haptic effects can be sent to one or more motors at a time.
- Automatic device selection is recommended if you only own 1 device.
- Select devices manually when building apps for others.
- By default, the Neurosity SDK uses Wi-Fi and the cloud.
- As of Neurosity OS v16, there is the option to use Bluetooth as a streaming transport.
- OSC data is streamed over port 9000 via UDP.
- Each mode can be enabled independently, allowing you to use either or both modes
  simultaneously.
- Requires Neurosity OS v16+, to be released in January 2023
- Not all browsers support Web Bluetooth.
