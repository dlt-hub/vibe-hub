notes:
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Public access without token or api_key is available for a few set of APIs with limited
  access.
- You need to have service definitions in order to script against the 3rd party service
  in the front-end interface of DreamFactory.
- 'API call format: /rest/user/password?reset=true'
- 'Payload format: {email: "user@domain.com", password: "password", reset: true}'
- Custom authentication methods can be implemented with a third-party authentication
  provider.
- Only GET requests work after update to 2.1
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'

- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
