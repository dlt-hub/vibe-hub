auth_info:
- information_source; https://access.redhat.com/articles/3626371:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer $token". Developers can use standard OIDC libraries
    supporting OAuth 2.0 to obtain and manage tokens for building authorization into
    scripts and applications.'
  - 'Red Hat APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authorization. You must first generate an offline
    token from the API Tokens page, then exchange it for an access token, and include
    the access token in API requests. The documentation indicates a two-step token
    flow: offline token acquisition followed by access token generation for API calls.'
  - The API uses OAuth2 bearer token authentication. Obtain an access_token by exchanging
    a refresh_token at the Red Hat SSO endpoint (https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token)
    with grant_type=refresh_token and client_id=rhsm-api, then send the access_token
    in the Authorization header as "Bearer {access_token}".
  - The API uses OAuth2 refresh token flow for authentication. Obtain an offline_token
    from https://access.redhat.com/management/api, then exchange it for an access_token
    by posting to https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
    with grant_type=refresh_token, client_id=rhsm-api, and refresh_token parameters.
    Include the access_token in API requests via the Authorization header as "Bearer
    {access_token}".
  - The Red Hat Subscription Management API uses Bearer token authentication. Include
    the token in the Authorization header as "Bearer $token" when making requests
    to api.access.redhat.com endpoints.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://access.redhat.com/articles/3626371:
  - The API supports pagination via the `limit` query parameter, as shown in the example
    request to `/management/v1/systems?limit=100`. However, the provided documentation
    does not contain sufficient details about pagination mechanics such as offset/cursor
    parameters, response fields indicating pagination state, or instructions for navigating
    to subsequent pages.
