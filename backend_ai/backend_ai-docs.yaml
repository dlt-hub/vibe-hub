  - HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Client constructs an Authorization
    header with scheme "BackendAI sign" containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature
    is computed over a canonicalized string combining HTTP method, request path, timestamp,
    canonicalized headers (lowercased name with trimmed value), and SHA256 hash of
    the request body (or empty string for GET). The signing key is derived separately.
    All non-ASCII strings must be UTF-8 encoded, header values trimmed of whitespace,
    and components joined with newline characters.
  - The API uses HMAC signature-based authentication. Each request requires an Authorization
    header containing signature information generated according to the "Signing API
    Requests" section (details not provided in this excerpt). Requests must also include
    a Date header in RFC 8022 or ISO 8601 format (UTC assumed, within 15-minute server
    deviation), an X-BackendAI-Version header with format vX.yyyymmdd, and optionally
    an X-BackendAI-Date header (mirrors Date) and X-BackendAI-Client-Token header
    for idempotent request deduplication.
  - The API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Construct an Authorization
    header with the format "BackendAI signMethod=HMAC-SHA256, credential=<access-key>:<signature>"
    where the signature is computed using your access key and secret key. The access-key
    and signature are separated by a colon in the credential field.

  - The API uses TokenAuth for all endpoints shown. This is a token-based authentication
    scheme where a token must be provided to access the endpoints. The exact mechanism
    for providing the token (header name, parameter name, or other method) is not
    specified in this documentation excerpt, so the precise implementation details
    cannot be determined from the provided text.
  - The API uses TokenAuth for authentication. All endpoints require a valid token
    to be sent with requests. User privilege and manager status (FROZEN or RUNNING)
    are required as preconditions for accessing cluster template operations.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.backend.ai/en/latest/manager/common-api/auth.html:
  - The API uses optional Link headers specified in RFC 5988 for paginating collections
    of objects. The Link header contains web links, typically with rel="next" or rel="prev"
    to navigate between pages.
