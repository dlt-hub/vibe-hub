auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.mailinator.com/docs/index.html:
  - API token authentication is required. The token is obtained from the Team Settings
    page in the Web interface and must be sent with API requests to access email in
    Mailinator via the API. Exact header name and usage method are not specified in
    this documentation excerpt.
  - Mailinator uses API token authentication. The token can be passed either as a
    query parameter named token or as an HTTP Authorization header. The token value
    should be your team's API token obtained from your Team Settings page. All API
    calls require this token to be included.
  - Public webhooks require no authentication or authorization. However, strict rate
    and count limits are enforced on public incoming webhooks. Messages are posted
    as JSON to the webhook URL with Content-Type application/json header. Private
    domains with subscriptions support authenticated webhooks with higher rate limits
    and additional features.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.mailinator.com/docs/index.html:
  - 'Query parameters control pagination: skip (default 0, optional) specifies the
    number of emails to skip, and limit (default 50, optional) specifies how many
    emails to fetch. The sort parameter (default descending, optional) orders results
    ascending or descending. Continue paginating by incrementing skip by the limit
    value until fewer results than limit are returned.'
  - 'The API supports pagination via query parameters: limit (controls number of results
    returned) and sort (with value "descending" to order results). The response returns
    a msgs array containing the paginated messages, but no explicit next page indicator
    or cursor field is provided in the response structure shown.'
