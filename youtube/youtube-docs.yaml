notes:
- Requires setup of OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
- This lesson aims to explain the different approaches to authentication for a REST
  API application.
- It also explains the workings of Basic Auth, the authentication mechanism we'll
  implement in this course.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Demonstrating OAuth2 authorization flow and user consent
- Summary of authentication methods and security recommendations
- Several types of authentication ways implemented for web services.
- Learn about Basic Authentication, Bearer Token Authentication, and OAuth.
- YouTube API requires OAuth2 setup for access.
- Some data may not be available due to privacy settings.
- The limit option allows you to limit the number of rows returned from a query
- offset allows you to omit a specified number of rows before the beginning of the
  result set
errors:
- '403 Forbidden: Check API key and permissions'
- '404 Not Found: Verify endpoint and parameters'
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '403 Forbidden: Check API key and permissions.'
- '404 Not Found: Verify the resource ID.'
- '400 Bad Request: Check request parameters.'
