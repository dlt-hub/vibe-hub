auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/here.com/tracking/2.1.191/openapi.json:
  - A device or device owner authenticates using an access token obtained from either
    the `/v2/token` endpoint (for devices) or the `/users/v2/login` endpoint (for
    device owners). The access token is then used in API calls to send telemetry data
    to HERE Tracking. The token should be sent as a bearer token in the Authorization
    header of the request.
  - Authorization via Bearer token in the Authorization header. The token must be
    provided as a required header parameter in the format "Bearer {token}".
  - Bearer token authentication is required. Send the token in the Authorization header
    as "Bearer {token}".
  - Device authentication uses a deviceId and deviceSecret credential pair. The credentials
    are returned in the response body when a device license is created. If the autoclaim
    query parameter is set to true, the created device is also claimed by the same
    user account.
  - 'OAuth 1.0 with HMAC-SHA256 signature. Required parameters in request: oauth_consumer_key,
    oauth_nonce, oauth_signature_method (HMAC-SHA256), oauth_timestamp, oauth_version
    (1.0). Signature is created by HMAC-SHA256 signing a base string constructed from
    HTTP method, endpoint URL, and URL-encoded parameters, using deviceSecret followed
    by an ampersand as the signing key.'
