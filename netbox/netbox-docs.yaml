auth_info:
- information_source; https://staging.netboxlabs.com/docs/v3.7/netbox/features/api-integration/:
  - The REST API and GraphQL API both employ token-based authentication. Credentials
    are sent via the Authorization header with the format "Token $TOKEN", where $TOKEN
    is the API token that maps to a user account and their assigned permissions.
- information_source; https://staging.netboxlabs.com/docs/v3.7/netbox/features/configuration-rendering/:
  - Token-based authentication is required. Pass the API token in the Authorization
    header as "Token $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your API token value.
  - Token-based authentication is required. Send requests with the Authorization header
    containing "Token $TOKEN", where $TOKEN is your API token. The token should be
    included in the Authorization header as "Token <your_api_token>".
- information_source; https://staging.netboxlabs.com/docs/v3.7/netbox/integrations/rest-api/:
  - A token is a unique 40-character hexadecimal identifier mapped to a NetBox user
    account used for REST API authentication. Tokens are created per user, can optionally
    expire, support write-operation restrictions, and can be restricted to specific
    client IP addresses. The token key is sent with API requests for authentication
    (exact header/parameter name for token transmission is not specified in this excerpt).
  - Authentication uses a token-based scheme. Include the Authorization header with
    the format "Token $TOKEN" where $TOKEN is your API token value.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://staging.netboxlabs.com/docs/v3.7/netbox/integrations/rest-api/:
  - List endpoints return paginated responses with count, next, previous, and results
    fields. Use the next or previous hyperlinks to navigate pages; pagination stops
    when next is null.
  - Pagination is indicated by the response fields count, next, previous, and results.
    The next field contains the URL for the next page of results, or null when there
    are no more pages. Use the next URL to fetch subsequent pages until next is null.
