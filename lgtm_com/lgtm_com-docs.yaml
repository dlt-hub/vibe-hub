auth_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/lgtm.com/v1.0/openapi.json:
  - The API uses access token authentication. Send the access token in the Authorization
    header (standard Bearer token format) as specified by the "access-token" security
    scheme. The x-auth-mode value of "BINARY" indicates the token should be sent as
    a binary/raw token in the Authorization header.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/lgtm.com/v1.0/openapi.json:
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based approach. Request results with an optional start
    query parameter, and the response includes a next field containing the full URL
    for the next page of results. Continue paginating until the next field is absent
    or null.
  - Pagination uses a cursor-based scheme with a start query parameter. The response
    includes a next field containing the URL for the next page (omitted if no next
    page exists); use this URL directly to fetch subsequent pages.
  - Pagination uses a next field in the response containing the full URL for the next
    page of results, with start and limit query parameters. The start parameter indicates
    the offset position and limit controls the page size (default 100).
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination where the response includes a nextPageUrl
    field containing the full URL to retrieve the next page of projects. The nextPageUrl
    is omitted from the response when there is no next page, indicating pagination
    completion.
