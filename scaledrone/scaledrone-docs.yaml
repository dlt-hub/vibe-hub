auth_info:
- information_source; https://www.scaledrone.com/blog/go-chat-app-tutorial-build-a-real-time-chat/:
  - 'The authentication approach uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) signed with a Scaledrone
    channel secret. Users authenticate by sending a POST request to the /auth endpoint,
    which generates a JWT token containing standard claims like expiration time (exp).
    The token is then passed to Scaledrone to establish precise access levels. Two
    constants must be configured: scaledroneID (the channel ID from the Scaledrone
    dashboard) and scaledroneSecret (the channel secret from the Scaledrone dashboard),
    both used to sign and validate the JWT.'
- information_source; https://www.scaledrone.com/docs/api-clients/rest:
  - Whether REST requests need authentication depends on your channel's authentication
    settings. If authentication is required, use the Basic Authorization header with
    the format "Basic [base64-encoded-credentials]" as shown in the example "Basic
    QWxhZijpbjpA..". For details on implementation, refer to the Basic Authentication
    documentation.
- information_source; https://www.scaledrone.com/docs/authentication:
  - 'Scaledrone provides two authentication methods: Basic Authentication for REST
    API, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for JavaScript clients or REST API. Authentication
    is optional and can be enabled from the dashboard to control publishing messages
    and subscribing to rooms. Specific header names, parameter formats, and token
    acquisition details are documented in the Basic Authentication and JWT Authentication
    sections respectively.'
- information_source; https://www.scaledrone.com/docs/basic-authentication:
  - 'Basic Authentication requires setting an Authorization header for REST API calls
    by base64-encoding the channel_id and secret_key in the format "channelId:secretKey".
    The header format is "Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_string>". This method
    cannot be used for JavaScript clients.'
- information_source; https://www.scaledrone.com/docs/jwt-authentication:
  - Both Socket connections and REST API can be authenticated using JSON Web Tokens
    (JWT) encoded with HMAC SHA-256 (HS256) using your channel's secret. The JWT payload
    must include the "client" claim (client ID from JavaScript client), "channel"
    claim (channel ID), and "permissions" claim, with token expiration handled via
    the standard "exp" JWT claim.
