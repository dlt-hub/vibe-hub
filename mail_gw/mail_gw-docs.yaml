- information_source; https://docs.mail.gw:
  - Bearer token authorization is required in the Authorization header when connecting
    to the Mercure SSE endpoint at `https://api.mail.gw/.well-known/mercure` to listen
    to messages on topic `/accounts/{id}`. Send the token as `Bearer TOKEN` in the
    headers.
  - Use Bearer token authentication for all requests except account creation and /domains
    endpoints. Obtain the token via POST /token with credentials in the request body,
    then include it in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>" for subsequent
    requests.
- information_source; https://docs.mail.gw/:
  - Authentication uses Bearer tokens obtained via POST /token endpoint. Send the
    token in the Authorization header for all requests except POST /accounts and POST
    /token. The token is acquired by making a POST request to /token with account
    credentials in the request body (specific body parameters not detailed in provided
    excerpt).

    via the Mercure SSE endpoint at `https://api.mail.gw/.well-known/mercure`. Use

    token.
