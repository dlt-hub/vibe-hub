auth_info:
- information_source; https://blog.whoisjsonapi.com/how-to-make-rest-api-requests-in-golang/:
  - Golang provides multiple authentication approaches for REST API requests. Basic
    authentication is implemented using the SetBasicAuth method on HTTP requests,
    passing username and password credentials. The documentation also mentions support
    for API keys and OAuth tokens, though specific implementation details for those
    methods are not provided in this excerpt.
- information_source; https://whoisjsonapi.com/page/documentation:
  - 'Bearer token authentication is required. Include your API token in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: Bearer {your-api-token}" for all requests to the WHOIS
    JSON API endpoints.'
  - The API requires an authentication token for each request. You must have a developer
    account on whoisjsonapi.com to obtain this token. The token is necessary for API
    usage and should be sent with each request, though the exact header name or parameter
    name for sending the token is not specified in this excerpt.
  - 'The API requires authentication via Bearer token. Pass your API token either
    in the Authorization header as ''Authorization: Bearer {your-api-token}'' or as
    a GET query parameter named ''apiKey'' with the token value.'
