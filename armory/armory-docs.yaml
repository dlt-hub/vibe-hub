auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/armory-admin/api-endpoint/:
  - Gate supports X509 client certificate-based authentication on a dedicated port
    (8085). Clients must present a certificate signed by a configured CA certificate
    that Gate validates; the CA certificate is imported as a trust store and Gate
    uses it to validate all inbound certificate-based clients. TLS termination cannot
    occur on a load balancer for this endpoint since certificate validation happens
    at Gate.

  : - GitHub, Stash, and GitLab authentication via tokens. GitHub uses githubToken
      (supports encryption) sent to githubEndpoint (default https://api.github.com).
      Stash requires stashUsername and stashToken (encrypted) to stashEndpoint. GitLab
      uses gitlabToken (encrypted) to gitlabEndpoint. Terraform git access uses accessToken
      and username. Vault secrets use authMethod, role, and path for authentication.

  : - Slack, Twilio, and GitHub use token-based authentication. Slack requires a bot
      token passed via the `token` parameter (supports encrypted values). Twilio requires
      an account SID in the `account` parameter and an auth token in the `token` parameter
      (supports encrypted values). GitHub requires an account token in the `token`
      parameter (supports encrypted values). All tokens support encrypted values.
- information_source; https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/installation/ae-instance-reg/:
  - 'OAuth2 token-based authentication is required. Configure the following in your
    Spinnaker gate profile: set tokenIssuerUrl to https://auth.cloud.armory.io/oauth/token,
    clientId to your registered client ID, and clientSecret to your registered client
    secret. These credentials are obtained during instance registration and must be
    placed in spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.gate.armory.cloud.iam.'
- information_source; https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/armory-admin/artifacts-github-connect/:
  - GitHub Personal Access Token authentication is supported via the token field in
    the GitHub account configuration, with alternative options for username/password
    or file-based credentials. The token field accepts direct values or encrypted
    secret references, and can alternatively use username/password, usernamePasswordFile,
    or tokenFile fields for credential storage.
