notes:
- MySQL REST Service stores its configuration in the mysql_rest_service_metadata database
  schema.
- The MRS Server Component is not available in production quality yet.
- Experimental packages of MySQL Server including the upcoming MySQL REST Service
  server component can be downloaded from labs.mysql.com.
- A REST service must be added first.
- The MySQL account used to connect to the targeting MySQL Solution needs to be granted
  the mysql_rest_service_schema_admin MySQL role.
- Uses REST data mapping views to access relational and document data
- MRS currently supports the following authentication methods.
- Authentication is handled by MRS against MRS REST Service specific accounts.
- The MRS Script Examples are written in TypeScript and need to be built before they
  can be uploaded to MRS.
- Make sure that the Enable MRS Scripts checkbox is checked and click OK to upload
  the files to the MRS service.
- Authentication is required to retrieve /api/20190715/router/status
errors:
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- '412 Precondition Failed: ETag mismatch on update'
