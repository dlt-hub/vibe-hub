- At merchant request, Global‑e can customize the return reasons and the order in
  which they are displayed.
- We do not advise using mail for goods over £200/$250.
- Global‑e also recommends that merchants set free shipping thresholds slightly higher
  than the current AOV to increase basket value.
- The report should be in CSV format and include commas as separators. Global-e does
  not support tabulations, semi-columns, or any other separators.
- It is important to immediately notify Global-e if an item cannot be fulfilled to
  avoid longer waiting periods for parcels in the holding area and compromising customer
  delivery promises.
- It is always advisable to have two viable shipping options, one which is faster
  and more expensive and one which is slower and cheaper.

- Additionally, we can configure the transactional emails to showcase the customization
  or add-on beneath the parent product instead of displaying them on separate lines.
- Ensure the API uses the correct Global-e GUID for each environment.
- By default, the customization or add-on is displayed on separate lines on the checkout
  page.
- The Global-e Module supports a fixed price list per country.
- To enable this feature, the Global-e Module must be able to read country-specific
  price lists embedded within the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Non-returnable products prevent customer-initiated returns on the Returns Portal,
  but Customer Support Representatives (CSR) can override this restriction.
- This feature is only applicable to countries for which the default currency is identified
  in the defaults section.
- Requires Global-e Module TypeScript solution
- Use /PROD/ path for production, and /QA-INT/ or /STG/ for testing or development.
- merchantId is your unique merchant identifier provided by Global-e.
- shopperCountryCode is the two-letter ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country code of the shopper.

  connect.bglobale.com (QA-INT) or connect2.bglobale.com (STG).
- Uses the Analytics SDK to track browsing activity for shoppers.
- Critical to call sendBrowsingStartEvent() on every page load.
- Work with your developer or frontend team to expose this language value where needed.
- Make sure to let your Global-e integration engineer know where the language code
  is stored (such as cookie name or attribute name) so we can configure your Checkout
  page to read and use it automatically.
- This method forces the Checkout page to load in the shopper country's default language
  independent of what browser or site language they use.
- You can do this by asking your Global-e contact to enable this configuration for
  your store.
- The Global‑e integration relies internally on CSS selectors to locate various data
  points on your web store.
- 'Static Rendering Preferred: These attributes should be rendered into the DOM on
  initial page load (SSR or CSR) and be available before the Global-e integration
  script is executed.'
- 'Avoid Obfuscation: Do not mask, transform, or dynamically hide these attributes
  via JavaScript or CSS.'
- 'Error Handling: Ensure values are not empty or malformed. If values are unavailable,
  consider hiding the MyAccount integration until valid data can be displayed.'
- You can have this feature enabled without making any changes to your site.
- Global-e lets you pass the preferred language code in your getCheckoutCartInfo API
  response.
- You can do this by adding a "cultureCode" field to your API response and setting
  it to a supported language code (such as "it", "es-MX", or "ko-KR").
- The SKU should not include spaces.
- The composition field can be empty if the Merchant provides an HS code.
- If the HS code and composition are not specified, GE will apply the default HS code
  to all products.
- Do not include commas in the prices you list in the CSV file, as this may cause
  parsing errors.
- When enabling editing in your CSV file, your security settings may change the CSV
  file format to Excel. Make sure to save your file in CSV format before uploading
  it to Global-e.
- After your catalog is approved, Global-e provides you with a username and password
  for the SFTP server to upload it to the Global-e server.
- Ensure proper setup for webhook notifications.
- Requires setup of OAuth2 credentials in the Global-e Merchant Portal
- Client-side requires Session and Cart token in request URL parameters.
- Server-side requires Cart token as a request URL parameter.
- The Bespoke JavaScript module will load asynchronously and not block current page
  rendering.
- Replace **{merchant id}** at the end of the URL with the merchant ID provided to
  you by Global-e.
- The GlobalE_Data cookie is used to determine which country is currently selected
  and to change the currently selected country.
- Ensure the cookie is not http only.
- When done, save your CSV file.
- After you have completed filling your file, you need to send it to your Project
  Manager for approval.
- The Global-e Clarification team reviews your CSV file to ensure correct formatting.
- If there are any errors in the file, it will be sent back to you to be corrected.
- This process continues until meeting the requirements necessary to upload to your
  site.
- Replace {merchant id} at the end of the URL with the merchant ID provided to you
  by Global-e.
- Due to rounding rules, the individual product price must be used for the price parameter,
  not the line item subtotal.
- An administrator account for your Platform is required
- A Global‑e Merchant account is required

- 'Get orders starting with: Oldest'
- 'Get orders and shipments returns internal comment: Yes'
- 'Get orders and shipments returns Other: Yes'
- 'Get products returns cost price: Yes'
- 'Bundles in shipments: Only containing items'
- 'Bundles in orders: Only containing items'
- Requires setup of secret API key for authentication
- Webhook URL must be constructed with specific details

- The Global‑e add-on setup requires a Global‑e merchant account.
- 'Supported SAP Hybris version: 2211.3.'
- The Global-e add-on setup requires a Global-e merchant account.
- Make sure to whitelist Global‑e IPs.
- 'Global‑e calls: <merchant_site>/globalerest/* (multiple endpoints)'
- Global‑e handles checkout via API calls
- Care should be taken when creating a promotion where conversions are used.
- Actions with fixed discounts will not be applied if neither store’s default currency
  - nor a promotion’s action currency matches a customer session currency.
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in global-e
- If customers do not enable cookies, they cannot change the default country and checkout
  via Global‑e.
- Global‑e manages a range of cookies.
- For price sorting and price range facets to work for Global‑e-managed-countries
  on the product listing and search pages, you must configure indexed currencies and
  price ranges.
- The Solr index runs outside of the web session.
- This also affects fixed prices. If you have country-specific product fixed prices,
  the fixed prices are not indexed, unless the country is the default ship-to country.
- Authentication is required to access all API endpoints.
- Ensure you have shared with Global‑e the features you want Global‑e to support,
  including the list of countries and special features such as Fixed Prices, multiple
  sites, and more.
- Make sure to confirm with the Global-E Integration team that you are using the stable
  version of the module.
- Global‑e repositories are not publicly accessible, but read-only access can be requested.
- Make sure not to cache them (remove them from varnish or any other cache mechanism).

  Log is enabled for all Global‑e Services at least for the first couple of weeks
  after Production launch.
- The custom hook handler is not implemented out-of-the-box.
- The Global-e Client JS SDK is needed for showing the Welcome pop-up, Global-e standard
  Country Switcher and Global-e Checkout.
- The default implementation of the Global-e country switcher works out of the box
  with Global-e cartridges.
- Some hooks require additional configuration on the Global‑e side.
- The custom hook is not invoked OOTB for OrderDispatchUpdate, OrderRefundUpdate,
  OrderRMAUpdate, and OrderStatusUpdate.
- By default is not required any configuration. The default value should not be changed
  without good reason.
- Global-e integration requires proper configuration to function correctly.
- Ensure that the Global-e Merchant ID and GUID are provided.
- Must be set Global‑e Merchant ID (which is provided by the Global‑e team to the
  Merchant team)
- Must be set Global‑e Merchant GUID (which is provided by the Global‑e team to the
  Merchant team)
- The token exchanged within the SendCart API call to display the Global-e checkout
  iframe.
