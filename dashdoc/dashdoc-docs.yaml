pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.dashdoc.com/docs/get-started/core-api-concepts/pagination:
  - Pagination uses a `page` query parameter (defaults to 1 if not specified). Responses
    include `count` (total items), `next` (URL to next page or null), `previous` (URL
    to previous page or null), and `results` (current page items). Iterate through
    pages by following the `next` URL until it returns null.
  - Use the `page` query parameter to request specific pages of paginated results.
    By default, pages contain 20 or 100 items depending on the endpoint. If `page`
    is not specified, the API returns the first page.
- information_source; https://developer.dashdoc.com/docs/integrate-your-software/setup/make-an-authenticated-request:
  - Pagination uses limit-offset scheme with query parameters. Response includes count
    (total items), next (URL for next page or null), previous (URL for previous page
    or null), and results array. Use the next/previous URLs from response to navigate
    pages; stop when next is null.
