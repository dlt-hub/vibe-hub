pagination_info:
- information_source; https://habr.com/ru/articles/537966/:
  - Pagination uses page-based or offset-based parameters in query strings. Page-based
    requests use `?page=10` to fetch specific pages, while offset-based requests use
    `?offset=1000` with a `LIMIT` value (typically 100 items per page). Both approaches
    retrieve sequential chunks of data from the server.
  - The API uses cursor-based pagination. Request the next page by passing the `cursor`
    query parameter (an opaque string) from the previous response. The response includes
    `items` (the data) and a `cursor` field for fetching the next page. Continue paginating
    until no `cursor` is returned in the response.
- information_source; https://habr.com/ru/articles/846130/:
  - Pagination is passed in the request body via a `pagination` object (schema reference),
    but the actual pagination parameter structure is not defined in the provided documentation.
    Response pagination fields are also not shown. Insufficient information to extract
    pagination details.
  - Pagination uses required query parameters pageIndex (integer) and recordsPerPage
    (integer) to control which page and how many records per page are returned. The
    response includes a pagination object containing these same fields to indicate
    the current pagination state.
  - Use pageIndex (integer, required) and recordsPerPage (integer, required) as query
    parameters to request pages. Response includes pageIndex, recordsPerPage, and
    totalRecords to track pagination state and determine when to stop paginating.

  - Actual API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger specs, API reference guides, etc.)
  - 'An example of an RPC method endpoint: `POST /articles/decline` or `POST /decline-article`


    The example shown (`/articles/decline`) is an **endpoint path**, not a base URL.
    A base URL would be something like `https://api.example.com` or `https://api.example.com/v1`'
