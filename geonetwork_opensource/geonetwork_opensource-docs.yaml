auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.geonetwork-opensource.org/4.2/fr/api/the-geonetwork-api/:
  - 'The API uses two-factor authentication: HTTP Basic Auth (username and password
    via --user flag) combined with XSRF token protection. The XSRF token must be extracted
    from cookies (typically from a Set-Cookie header containing XSRF-TOKEN) and sent
    in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header with each request. Credentials are passed as $CATALOGUSER
    and $CATALOGPASS environment variables, and cookies must be persisted across requests
    using -c and -b flags.'

  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication combined with CSRF token protection. Credentials
    are sent via the --user flag (username:password format), and an X-XSRF-TOKEN header
    must be included in all requests. Cookies are managed via -c and -b flags for
    session persistence across requests.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.geonetwork-opensource.org/4.2/fr/api/the-geonetwork-api/:
  - The search endpoint uses `from` and `size` parameters in the request body to control
    pagination. The `from` parameter specifies the offset (starting position) and
    `size` specifies the number of results to return per request. Construct subsequent
    requests by incrementing the `from` value by the `size` amount to retrieve the
    next page of results.
