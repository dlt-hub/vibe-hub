pagination_info:

  - Cursor-based pagination using after and before query parameters. The after parameter
    specifies the thread item ID to start listing items after it (defaults to null
    for first page), and before specifies the ID to list items before it. Both are
    optional query parameters.
  - Cursor-based pagination using optional `page` query parameter (a cursor string
    from the previous response's `next_page` field). The `limit` parameter controls
    bucket count returned, with defaults of 7 for 1d width, 24 for 1h, and 60 for
    1m width, with respective maximums of 31, 168, and 1440. Use the `next_page` field
    from the response to paginate through results.
  - 'Cursor-based pagination using optional `page` query parameter (a cursor string
    from the previous response''s `next_page` field). The `limit` query parameter
    controls bucket count returned, with defaults and maximums varying by `bucket_width`
    (1d: default 7 max 31, 1h: default 24 max 168, 1m: default 60 max 1440). Response
    includes `next_page` field for fetching subsequent pages.'
  - 'Cursor-based pagination using query parameters: after (optional, object ID for
    next page) and before (optional, object ID for previous page) to navigate forward
    and backward through vector store lists. limit (optional, defaults to 20) controls
    page size.'
  - Cursor-based pagination using the `after` query parameter, which accepts an object
    ID to define the current position in the list. The `limit` query parameter controls
    page size, ranging from 1 to 10,000 with a default of 10,000. Subsequent requests
    use the last object ID from the previous response as the `after` value to fetch
    the next page.
