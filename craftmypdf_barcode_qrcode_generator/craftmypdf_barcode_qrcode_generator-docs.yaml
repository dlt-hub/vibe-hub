pagination_info:
- information_source; https://craftmypdf.com/docs/index.html:
  - Pagination uses limit and offset as query parameters. limit specifies the maximum
    number of templates to return per request (example shows limit=300), and offset
    specifies the starting position (example shows offset=0). Increment offset by
    the limit value to retrieve subsequent pages until all templates are fetched.
  - The List templates endpoint uses offset-based pagination with query parameters
    limit (optional, default 300) to specify the number of records per request and
    offset (optional, default 0) to skip records. Continue paginating by incrementing
    the offset parameter until fewer records than the limit are returned or no results
    remain.
  - 'The endpoint uses offset-limit pagination with query parameters: limit (integer,
    default 300, specifies number of records to retrieve) and offset (integer, default
    0, specifies number of records to skip). Construct subsequent requests by incrementing
    the offset parameter by the limit value until fewer records than the limit are
    returned.'
