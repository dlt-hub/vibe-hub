notes:
- Workflows now supports logging in via SSO with one or more identity providers. This
  feature is available to Enterprise customers.
- CORS proxy is enabled by default for all newly created reference docs.
- Anonymous (public) login with OIDC is now supported and configurable for Developer
  portals.
- Deprecated docs
- The developer portal beta is approaching end of life
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in api
- Some objects like Contact may return nulls in deeply nested fields
- Your plan/role may not allow you to create teams in Workflows
- Users of Workflows are recommended to migrate to Redoc.
- For users of the beta version of the Developer Portal, consider Revel with Redoc,
  or Realm.
- Migration to Realm may require manual adjustments and testing after using the migration
  helper script.
- The developer portal beta is approaching end of life.
- Use Realm and Reunite instead.
- Pay attention to the indentation in YAML files.
- Do not include a page in more than one sidebar.
- Some theming options apply only to the drilldown sidebar style.
- Use Realm and Reunite instead. Read the migration guide.
- The `public` folder name is reserved at the top-level of the portal project structure.
- Use the `static` folder to add assets like images and PDF documents.
- Create an account in Redocly Workflows
- Create an account with a version control service provider such as GitHub or GitLab
- Redoc doesn't load any fonts by default, so you have to take care of it yourself.
- Redirects must be defined in the specified format in redirects.json.
- Supported redirect types are 301 and 302.
- Custom fonts are supported in API docs regardless of how you're hosting them (on-premise
  or in Workflows).
- You must import all those fonts into your API docs HTML template.
- The *Try it* feature is not available in Redoc.
- Server must support CORS requests or use CORS proxy.
- Reference docs 2.0 introduces a number of new functionalities and theming options
  that let you customize your API documentation and make it easier to use.
- 'Deep links are enabled by default in Reference docs 2.0. To disable them, add `disableDeepLinks:
  true` to your configuration file.'
- Sticky selection for request code samples in the right panel is preserved between
  page reloads and across all operations on the page.
- Added x-security extension for Respect that enables secure handling of authentication
  in Arazzo workflows.
- Use this extension to define security schemes at the step level using either predefined
  schemes or inline definitions.
- Pass values of secrets (passwords, tokens, API keys).
- Support multiple authentication types including API Key (query, header, or cookie),
  Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, Digest Authentication, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect.
- Automatically transform security parameters into appropriate HTTP headers or query
  parameters.
- Use the new Reunite platform for improved API management capabilities and integration
  with Redocly's tooling ecosystem.
- Migrated the codebase to ES Modules from CommonJS.
- The API registry serves as a single source of truth for your APIs, and allows you
  to reuse API definitions across your API versions, docs, and Developer portals.
- The API registry supports various file formats including Markdown, Web formats,
  YAML, JSON, Image files, Common document formats, and Other formats.
- File upload is supported for version control and CICD sources.
- The mock server feature is only available to Pro and Enterprise customers.
- The mock server feature is disabled by default.
- Follow this guide when you need to restart API registry preview branch builds to
  apply new configuration settings.
- Mapping rules are exclusive
- All users are added to the selected team by default.
- Mapping rules are exclusive.
- You can only add one mapping rule of a kind per identity provider.
- The on-premise functionality is supported only in our Enterprise plans.
- Redocly currently only supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider for
  advanced functionality including RBAC and API gateway proxy integrations.
- Owners must be logged into Workflows with SSO in order to disable Redocly account
  logins.
- You will need an Enterprise-level Redocly plan to connect to GitHub Enterprise,
  Azure or Bitbucket self-managed.
- You will need a Pro Redocly plan to use GitLab self-managed.
- The Redocly configuration file is used by multiple Redocly apps to help you control
  their behavior.
- The legacy configuration file is deprecated.
- Disallow invalid media type examples by ensuring they comply with the corresponding
  schema definitions.
- If your schema and example conflict, there is a problem in the definition of the
  schema or the example. Solve it before you ship it.
- Version pinning is recommended for production deployments to prevent potential compatibility
  issues with the latest version.
- Users can have one organization-level role and several project-level roles.
- Members of an organization will have `Maintainer` permissions to the organization's
  API registry versions.
- Basic auth is not secure, so we recommend choosing the SSO login for the most secure
  access control.
- Pro and Enterprise customers can use SSO with either an OIDC or SAML2 connected
  identity provider.
errors:
- 'REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Throttle API calls or reduce frequency'
- All our tools integrate well with one another, and since they are based on open
  standards, you can combine them with any other tools you choose.
- 'QUERY_TIMEOUT: Break down filters or add selectivity'
- '401 Unauthorized: Recheck OAuth scopes or token expiration'
- If the file size exceeds 20 MB or has an incorrect extension, the file is not added
  and an error message is displayed in the build log.
- If the combined size exceeds 100 MB, the add process fails and an error message
  is displayed in the build log.
- This example produces an error because the year is a string instead of an integer.
- This example produces an error due to additional property.
