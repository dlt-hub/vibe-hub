    from the previous response to retrieve the next page of transactions. The page[limit]
    query parameter controls the number of results per page.
  - Cursor-based pagination using page[limit] and page[after] query parameters. The
    response includes a links.next URL for the next page and meta.paging.after value
    to use as page[after] in subsequent requests. Stop paginating when links.next
    is absent.

    response includes links.first and links.next URLs for navigation, with meta.paging
    containing the current after cursor and limit value. Use the next link URL or
    extract the after value from meta.paging to request subsequent pages.
  - Cursor-based pagination using query parameters page[limit] and page[after]. The
    response includes a links object with first and next URLs, and a meta.paging object
    containing the current after cursor and limit. Use the next URL or construct subsequent

    of 10, and a links.first field provides the first page URL. No explicit next page
    field or cursor is shown for navigating subsequent pages.
