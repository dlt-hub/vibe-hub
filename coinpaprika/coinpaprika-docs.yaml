  - Most CoinPaprika API endpoints are available without authentication. However,
    an API key is recommended for higher rate limits and access to premium features,
    though the documentation does not specify the exact mechanism for providing the
    API key or which header/parameter name to use.
- information_source; https://docs.coinpaprika.com/get-started/api-rest-introduction:
  - Bearer token authentication is required for authenticated requests. Send your
    API key in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". The free tier allows
    1,000 requests per day without authentication. Obtain your API key from the pricing
    page at coinpaprika.com/api/pricing/.
