auth_info:
- information_source; https://jokes.one/api/joke/:
  - All API requests to jokes.one require the X-JokesOne-Api-Secret header with your
    API key as the value. Pass your api_key in the X-JokesOne-Api-Secret header for
    authentication on endpoints like /joke/search and /joke/random.
  - For public API calls, no authentication is required. For paid subscriptions, pass
    your API key via the request header 'X-JokesOne-Api-Secret' with your API key
    value, or alternatively as a query parameter 'api_key' (though header method is
    preferred).
  - If you are a subscriber accessing private endpoints, add the 'X-JokesOne-Api-Secret'
    header with your API key as the header value. Public endpoints like /jod do not
    require authentication, while private endpoints like /joke require this API key
    header.
  - The API requires an API key passed in the X-JokesOne-Api-Secret header. Include
    this header in all requests with your API key as the value.
  - 'The API requires authentication via the X-JokesOne-Api-Secret header. Pass your
    API key in the X-JokesOne-Api-Secret header with each request, for example: X-JokesOne-Api-Secret:
    api_key'
