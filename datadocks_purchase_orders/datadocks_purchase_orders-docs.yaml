auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.datadocks.com/api/:
  - API token-based authentication is required. Include your API token in the Authorization
    header as "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" for all requests. Each location uses its own
    subdomain (e.g., toronto-acme.datadocks.com). Contact DataDocks support to obtain
    your API token.
  - 'All API requests require authentication using a token-based scheme. Include your
    API token in the Authorization header with the format "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN".'
- information_source; https://docs.datadocks.com/api/appointments/:
  - 'API authentication uses a token-based scheme sent via the Authorization header.
    The token must be valid, not expired, have proper permissions, and may be location-specific.
    Send credentials as Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN in the request header.'
  - The API uses token-based authentication. Include the Authorization header with
    the value "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" in all requests. Replace YOUR_API_TOKEN with
    your actual API token and YOUR_LOCATION with your instance location in the request
    URL.
- information_source; https://docs.datadocks.com/api/companies/:

pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.datadocks.com/api/pagination/:
  - The `page` query parameter controls pagination, where `page=1` is the first page.
    Pass `page=2` for the second page and so on. The documentation does not specify
    response fields indicating pagination state, total pages, or when to stop paginating.
- information_source; https://docs.datadocks.com/api/purchase_orders/:
  - Use limit and offset query parameters for pagination. The limit parameter controls
    the number of records per request, and offset specifies the starting position
    (number of records to skip). Both are optional query parameters.
