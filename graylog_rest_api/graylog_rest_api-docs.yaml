  - The Graylog REST API supports two authentication methods. Access tokens are used
    as the username in Basic Auth requests with the literal password "token". Session
    tokens are obtained via a POST request to /api/system/sessions with a JSON body
    containing username and password fields, and the response includes a session_id
    field that serves as the authentication token; session tokens expire after a configurable
    time period.
