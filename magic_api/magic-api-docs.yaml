notes:
- API Key is required in the header as 'x-magicapi-key'
- 'By default, each request consumes ''1'' API call for the given Pricing Plan. Hence
  the default header is added to all requests: X-Magicapi-Billing: API=1;'
- 'If you wish to make certain endpoints ''FREE'', i.e., to NOT reduce the API usage
  when a user requests those endpointPaths, you can pass the header: X-Magicapi-Billing:
  API=0;'
- 'To charge more than ''one'' unit per request, update the header to the custom usage
  and send it as a response in your API: X-Magicapi-Billing: API=3;'
- The landmark web scraping case was bounced back to the Ninth Circuit by the U.S.
  Supreme Court.
