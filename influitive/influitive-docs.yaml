  - Access Token from your Smartsheet account is required and must be sent as a Header
    type parameter. The token should be included in the Authorization header when
    making requests to the Smartsheet API endpoints.
- ? information_source; https://support.klipfolio.com/hc/en-us/articles/215546948-Authentication-method-OAuth-Token-Authentication-for-REST-URL-Connector
  : - The REST/URL connector uses OAuth tokens for authentication. You need to have
      an existing OAuth token from the service provider, which you can manage (view,
      share, re-authorize, and delete) in the OAuth tokens section. The token is used
      when making API requests to authenticate your connection to the data source.

  - Klipfolio API requires an API key passed as a query parameter. The parameter name
    is kf-api-key, the parameter type is header, and you provide your API key as the
    parameter value. Twitter API uses OAuth authentication.
  - Signed authentication parameters are used by some third-party APIs like Amazon
    Web Services and Moz to secure user identity. These parameters consist of encrypted
    data elements such as API keys or user IDs, are specified by the individual API
    provider, and are included in the API query using standard parameter syntax following
    a question mark or ampersand.
  - The API supports optional authentication via API Key. If the API requires API
    Key authentication, configure it through Query Parameters according to the API's
    specification, and leave the Authentication Type at its default setting. The documentation
    indicates additional authentication types may be available but does not specify
    them.
