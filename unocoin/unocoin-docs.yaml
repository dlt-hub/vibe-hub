    and 2FA operations require additional parameters like secret (from Google Authenticator)
    and otp in the request body.
  - 'API access requires a Bearer token sent in the Authorization header. The token
    is generated when enabling API access and must be included as "Authorization:
    Bearer <token>" in request headers for authenticated endpoints like transaction
    history.'
  - API access requires a token generated during API enablement, sent as a request

    next_page_url, prev_page_url, and total for navigation; stop when next_page_url
    is null.'
  - Pagination uses query parameter page (optional, defaults to 1) in the URL. Response
    includes from, to, total, per_page (default 15), last_page, next_page_url, and
    prev_page_url fields to navigate pages; stop when next_page_url is null.

    first_page_url, last_page_url, next_page_url, prev_page_url, last_page, per_page
    (15 default), from, to, and total. Continue paginating by incrementing page parameter
    until next_page_url is null or current page reaches last_page.
  - 'Pagination uses query parameter page (required, starting at 1). Response includes
    current_page, per_page (default 15), total items, from, to, last_page, and URLs:

    record number), total (total records), per_page (records per page, default 15),
    last_page (total pages), next_page_url (URL for next page or null if last page),
    and prev_page_url (URL for previous page or null if first page). Use next_page_url
    and prev_page_url values to navigate between pages; stop when these fields are
