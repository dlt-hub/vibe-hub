notes:
- API calls are authenticated via account credentials or via a token.
- The platform provides a no code interface where you upload examples, label them,
  and train a model through guided steps.
- Accuracy varies by data quality and labeling, but detectors are designed to meet
  industry level standards for reliability.
- No new hardware required. Use your existing cameras and devices to monitor and collect
  visual data.
- No coding required!
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in Matroid
- Detectors verify that parts are correctly installed and steps are completed according
  to specifications.
