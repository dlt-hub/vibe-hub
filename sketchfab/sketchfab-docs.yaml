auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sketchfab.com/data-api/v3/index.html:
  - 'The Sketchfab API supports two authentication methods. For OAuth2, send the header
    Authorization: Bearer {INSERT_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE}. For API Token authentication,
    send the header Authorization: Token {INSERT_API_TOKEN_HERE}. Password-protected
    models require an additional header x-skfb-model-pwd with the password encoded
    in base64. See the Sketchfab OAuth2 documentation for token acquisition details.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.sketchfab.com/data-api/v3/index.html:
  - Pagination information is present in the response structure. The GET /v3/collections
    endpoint returns a CollectionResponse object containing a results array (Array[CollectionList],
    optional), which holds the paginated collection data. However, the documentation
    excerpt does not explicitly describe request parameters (such as page, limit,
    offset, cursor) or response fields (such as next, has_more, total_count) needed
    to navigate between pages, so complete pagination mechanics cannot be determined
    from this excerpt alone.
  - Pagination uses cursor-based navigation. Responses contain next and previous fields
    with full URLs for subsequent requests, plus a cursors object with previous and
    next cursor values. The count query parameter controls items per page with a default
    of 24 and a maximum cap of 24.
