- Client Identifier and Client Secret should not be exposed under any circumstances.

- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token — requires setup of connected app in SpreadsheetWeb
- This feature is not supported on Public Cloud accounts.
- An Action Button can only have one Goal Seek Event assigned to it.
- Users can customize the actual corresponding styles using Cascading Style Sheets
  (CSS) in the Stylesheet Designer.
- Enabling this option allows the formula result in the control to be overwritten.
- If a cell with Enable Formula Override is edited, a button will become available
  right next to the cell to clear the formula override.
- Using Force Override on Save is limited to scenarios where Enable Formula Override
  is enabled.
- If a cell with Enable Formula Override is edited, a button will become available
  right next to the cell, that can be used to clear the formula override.
- Each dropdown must be associated with a Single Named Range (SNR) and a List Named
  Range (LNR).
- Each radio button list must be associated with a Single Named Range (SNR) in the
  workbook.
- Named ranges containing formulas are excluded from the list.
- If a cell with Enable Formula Override is edited, a button will become available
  to clear the formula override.
- Using Force Override on Save option will save its current value and override the
  formula.
- List Named Ranges are one-dimensional ranges.
- When Show Formatted List Options is enabled, it displays the formatted value of
  each radio button option.
- Is List Static value is determined automatically based on the contents of the associated
  list named range.
- Support Multi-Select feature allows the user to select multiple values from the
  radio button list.
- Delimiter option defines the delimiter character used to separate multiple selected
  values.
- Label Size property indicates the spacing distribution of the input control's label
  vs. the input control.
- The uploaded file will not be stored in the system unless the target named range
  is also appropriately bound to a File-type column in a database for the existing
  application.
- The maximum file count can be between 1 and 100, with a default value of 1.
- The default horizontal alignment for labels is Left.
- The default vertical alignment for labels is Middle.
- Input grids are limited to 5,000 cells by default if meta-data formatting is enabled
  to prevent any performance issues.
- If your table named ranges contain more than 5,000 cells you will get an error.
- There is no cell limit if meta-data formatting is not enabled.
- By default, the maximum cells allowed in a given Table Named Range is 1000.
- To exceed the maximum target cell count, please reach out to your system administrator.
- Each slider must be associated with a Single Named Range (SNR) in the workbook.
- Enabling the Enable Formula Override option allows the formula result in the control
  to be overwritten.
- The Force Override on Save option is limited to scenarios where the published application
  has an Action Button control with Save event.
- Slider Size is used to define the height of the slider input in pixels, and should
  be an integer value between 100 and 1000.
- Styles that are defined in the Stylesheets module will not be visible in the User
  Interface Designer view of the application.
- Scripts that are injected into the HTML will be stripped from the contents control
  for security purposes.
- Output grids are limited to 10,000 cells by default to prevent any performance issues.
- The maximum allowable cells within a target range is configurable by the system
  administrator.
- Currently, only horizontally-oriented Table Named Ranges (TNR) are supported (i.e.
  columns are displayed horizontally).
- Some API calls may be rate limited
- No authentication required for accessing chart data.
- This field allows the visualization to be separated as groups by the data.
- The background color of the chart from Background Color palette.
- Naming your charts can help users distinguish their content and make better sense
  of them.
- Chart heights can be set manually within a range between 200 and 1000 pixels.
- You can customize your charts’ colors as you desired.
- Inverted Data swaps the X Axis Field and Y Axis Field data fields, without actually
  transposing them in Excel.
- The background color of the chart from the Background Color palette can be customized
  in this field.
- Naming your charts can help users distinguish their contents.
- You can further customize your chart by pressing the blue Edit buttons on the bottom
  of the right hand menu.
- Gauges are output controls that display a visual representation of a cell value
  in the user interface.
- Each gauge must be associated with a Single Named Range (SNR) from the workbook.
- Standard gauges are excellent for tracking progress or completion rates.
- Dial gauges are excellent for tracking progress or completion rates.
- Digital gauges act like an interactive display card; they show a quantity in a fancy
  way.
- Indicates whether the button control is enabled.
- Indicates whether the button control is visible.

- End users must be assigned a role that does not have access to the Control Panel.
- You can have a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20 columns for every application.
- The default data mask is raw for all types of fields if no formatting is applied.
- Some records may have limited support in nested fields
- The Notifications page allows sending automated emails based on changes in the database
  workflow features.
