auth_info:
- information_source; https://oncall.tools/docs/api.html:
  - This endpoint cannot be called using an API key. The user who creates the team
    must be authenticated as a user (not via API key), as they are automatically added
    as a team admin. No specific auth headers, parameters, or credentials are detailed
    in this documentation excerpt.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://oncall.tools/docs/api.html:
  - The documentation mentions a `limit` query parameter for controlling the number
    of results, but the parameter's details (whether it is required, default value,
    or maximum value) are incomplete in the provided text. No response pagination
    fields, headers, or navigation mechanism are described. Information is insufficient
    to fully document pagination behavior.
