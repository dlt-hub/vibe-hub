auth_info:
- information_source; https://developer.smartcitizen.me/:
  - Authenticated requests use an access token passed as a query parameter named access_token.
    For example, include ?access_token=MYAPITOKEN in the request URL. This applies
    to endpoints requiring authentication, such as updating user details or changing
    an avatar.
  - Authentication is performed via query parameter. Pass the access token as the
    `access_token` query parameter in the request URL (e.g., `access_token=123456789`).
  - 'HTTP Basic Authentication is required. Send a base64-encoded string of ''username:password''
    in the Authorization header as ''Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>''.
    The documentation explicitly discourages this method due to credential exposure
    risk, even over SSL.'
  - OAuth 2.0 is the recommended authentication method. Obtain an access_token by
    sending an authenticated POST request to https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/sessions
    with username and password parameters. Send the token either as a query parameter
    access_token or in the Authorization header as Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN. Alternatively,
    HTTP Basic Auth is supported by sending a base64 encoded username:password hash
    in the header, though this method is not recommended.
  - Requests to the onboarding endpoints require a valid 'Onboarding-Session' header.
    The register device endpoint additionally requires user authentication via a bearer
    token or session cookie, returning 401 "Authorization required" if missing. The
    'Onboarding-Session' header value is a UUID string (e.g., d049c9e7-0261-49e4-91be-8a0bafa1c8b9)
    that identifies an orphan device during the onboarding flow.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developer.smartcitizen.me/:
  - Pagination uses query parameters page (default 1) and per_page (default 25). Response
    includes Link header with rel="first", "last", "next", "prev" URLs, plus Total
    header for total result count and Per-Page header for results per page.
