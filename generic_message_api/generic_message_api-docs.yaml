auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.generic.se/messageapi/:
  - Authenticated users manage stop lists using HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials
    are sent as a Base64-encoded username:password pair in the Authorization header
    with the --basic flag. Users have exclusive control over their own stop list and
    cannot access others' lists. The username is included in the request URL path
    (e.g., /Stoplist/Alice) and must match the authenticated user.
  - 'Authentication uses an API key sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
    The API key is a UUID-format string that must be included in every request with
    the header `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`.'
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required, using username and password encoded in
    Base64 and sent in the Authorization header. The credentials are formatted as
    "Basic {Base64(username:password)}" in the Authorization header.
  - Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as a Base64-encoded string
    in the Authorization header with the format "Basic base64(UserID:Password)". The
    UserID and Password are obtained during user creation and must be sent with every
    request to authenticate.
  - 'Basic HTTP authentication is required. Send credentials as a Base64-encoded username:password
    pair in the Authorization header with the scheme "Basic". Example: username "Alice"
    with password "secretPwd" encodes to the header value "Basic QWxpY2U6c2VjcmV0UHdk".'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.generic.se/messageapi/:
  - 'Fetching messages uses URI parameters for pagination: Limit (optional, integer,
    default 100) controls max results per request, BeginId (optional, integer, default
    max) specifies the starting message ID, and Newer (optional, boolean, default
    false) reverses sort order from descending to ascending. To get newer messages,
    set BeginId to the newest known message ID and Newer=true; to get older messages,
    use the oldest known ID with Newer=false (default).'
  - Limit and offset parameters are used for pagination. Limit (query parameter, optional,
    default appears to be a standard value) specifies the maximum number of results
    per request, and offset (query parameter, optional, default 0) specifies the starting
    position. The response structure for pagination details is not shown in the provided
    documentation excerpt.
  - Pagination is supported through `limit` and `offset` query parameters, with a
    maximum of 10,000 records per request. Use `limit` to specify the number of records
    returned and `offset` to specify the starting position for retrieving subsequent
    pages.
