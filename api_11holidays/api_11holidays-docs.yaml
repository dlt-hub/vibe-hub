auth_info:
- information_source; https://11holidays.com/docs/api:
  - 'API key authentication is required. Include your API key in the Authorization
    header as "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" when making requests to the 11holidays
    API endpoints.'
  - The Holidays API requires an API key for authentication. The API key must be obtained
    by signing up on the website, but the documentation does not specify how to send
    the API key in requests (header name, query parameter, or other method).
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://11holidays.com/docs/api:
  - Pagination uses offset and limit as query parameters. The offset parameter defaults
    to 0, and limit accepts values between 1 and 1000. Use offset to skip records
    and limit to specify the number of results per request.
  - Pagination uses offset and limit query parameters. offset is optional with default
    value 0, and limit is optional with range 1 to 1000. Response returns an array
    of holiday objects; construct next request by incrementing offset by the limit
    value used until fewer results than limit are returned.
