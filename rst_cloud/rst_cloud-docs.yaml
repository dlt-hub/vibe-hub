notes:
- The integration is seamless and requires no extra software to be used to configure
  the firewalls.
- The API provides access to threat intelligence reports.
- Easy operationalisation and integration with security tools
- Rich contextual information from various sources
- No query rate limits from registrars
- Perform Whois lookups at any rate without concerns about bans
- Uses OAuth2 with refresh token â€” requires setup of connected app in api
- RST Threat Feed covers multiple IoCs types to detect and prevent all sorts of cyber
  attacks.
- The threat feed is available through an API and has many pre-built integrations
  with popular security information and event management (SIEM), security orchestration,
  automation, and response (SOAR), next-generation firewall (NGFW), and threat intelligence
  platform (TIP) systems.
- Appropriate API key for collecting data from RST Cloud (send an inquiry to trial@rstcloud.net
  or use this link)
- Import threat indicators that are at most one week old.
- Full data set is not available via TAXII/STIX integration. Use the standard API
  to fetch all possible indicators.
- Easy operationalisation and integration with security tools!
- Rich contextual information from various sources including social networks, TI reports,
  online sandboxes, and honeypot networks.
