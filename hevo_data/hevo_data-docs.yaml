auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hevodata.com/sources/engg-analytics/streaming/rest-api/:
  - 'Hevo REST API Source supports multiple authentication methods: No Auth (default),
    Basic Auth using HTTP Basic Authentication with username and password, and custom
    headers for credentials. Select the appropriate method based on your REST API
    Source requirements; if using custom headers, choose No Auth and specify credentials
    in the headers section instead.'
  - Hevo supports OAuth2 token exchange for REST API Sources, where client ID and
    client secret must be manually entered and sent as form fields in the request
    body. However, Hevo does not support OAuth flows requiring base64-encoded client
    credentials in the Authorization header, which may cause token creation to fail
    for such APIs.
  - OAuth 2.0 authorization flow is required. Hevo uses access tokens obtained via
    OAuth 2.0 to authenticate API requests. To configure OAuth, provide Client ID,
    Client Secret, Auth URL (authorization server endpoint), Token URL (token exchange
    endpoint), and optional Scopes (comma or space-delimited permissions list). The
    access token is then used by Hevo to make authenticated API requests to your Source.
- information_source; https://api-docs.hevodata.com/reference/response:
  - The API uses API key and secret authentication. A 401 Unauthorized error indicates
    an invalid API key and secret pair, and a 403 Forbidden error indicates the authenticated
    user lacks permissions for the requested operation. The documentation references
    an authentication section for base URLs and credential details.
- information_source; https://api-docs.hevodata.com/reference/pagination:
  - 'Authorization: Basic authentication scheme. Credentials are sent in the Authorization
    header as a Base64-encoded string in the format "Basic <base64(username:password)>".
    Example header: Authorization: Basic VFlZPK3SV1pJTTpJcENJVEU0QzM6K2RwNmNRT1VLEQ=='
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://docs.hevodata.com/sources/engg-analytics/streaming/rest-api/:
  - Hevo maintains an offset to track pagination progress through REST API responses.
    When Hevo reaches the last page (indicated by an empty string in the next page
    pointer for session-based pagination), it flushes the offset and restarts from
    the beginning on the next Pipeline run to capture new and updated data. Hevo does
    not support session-based pagination schemes that return empty strings to signal
    the end of data, causing offset resets and potential data re-ingestion.
  - Pagination is supported only when the REST API Source accepts pagination method
    information through Query Params. For POST methods, pagination parameters cannot
    be specified in the request body or headers since the request body cannot be edited
    during Pipeline runs; pagination is only supported via Query Params.
- information_source; https://api-docs.hevodata.com/reference/pagination:
  - Use cursor-based pagination with the `starting_after` query parameter. Include
    `limit` to control page size. The response contains `pagination.starting_after`
    (cursor for next page) and `pagination.count` (records returned). Stop when the
    `pagination` object is absent from the response.
- information_source; https://api-docs.hevodata.com/reference/getallpipelines:
  - The API uses a limit query parameter to control pagination. The example shows
    limit=20, indicating how many results to return per page. However, the documentation
    chunk provided does not include details about response fields for navigation (such
    as next, offset, total_count, or has_more) or how to retrieve subsequent pages.
  - 'The API uses cursor-based pagination with two query parameters: starting_after
    (string, optional) to specify the cursor position, and limit (int32, optional,
    defaults to 20) to control the number of results per page. Use the starting_after
    value from the response to fetch the next page.'
