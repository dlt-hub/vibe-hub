pagination_info:
- information_source; https://www.openphone.com/docs/mdx/api-reference/changelog:
  - Paginated endpoints return a `next` page token field that is `null` at the end
    of results. The `totalItems` field is present but does not return accurate total
    count. Use the `next` token value in subsequent requests to navigate pages; stop
    when `next` is `null`.
- information_source; https://www.openphone.com/docs/mdx/api-reference/users/list-users:
  - Use pageToken query parameter (optional) to retrieve subsequent pages, and maxResults
    query parameter (required, default 10, range 1-50) to set page size. Response
    includes nextPageToken field to construct the next request and totalItems field
    for total count. Stop paginating when nextPageToken is null or absent.
