auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.orbipay.com/auxiliary_paymentsapi/references/v1.1.0/:
  - Signature-based authentication is required. Requests must include a calculated
    signature, likely sent in request headers or as part of the authentication mechanism.
    The documentation references a "Signature Calculation Example" but the specific
    header name, signature algorithm, and calculation method are not fully detailed
    in the provided excerpt.
  - The API uses HMAC-SHA256 signature-based authentication. Include an Authorization
    header with format "OPAY1-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=<client_key>,Signature=<signature>"
    where the signature is computed as Base64(HMAC-SHA256(secret, input)) and input
    is constructed by concatenating HTTP method, path, query string, headers, and
    payload with colons as separators.
- information_source; https://developers.orbipay.com/fasterpayoutsapi/reference/:
  - The API requires authentication via a required header parameter named client_key
    (a unique identifier string) sent with each request. Additional required headers
    include product, payment_channel, requestor_type, and timestamp, which together
    form part of the authentication and request validation scheme.
  - 'The API requires multiple header parameters for authentication and request identification:
    client_key (unique identifier), product (product ID), payment_channel (FI channel),
    requestor_type (identifies requestor), timestamp (UTC datetime), and idempotent_request_key
    (unique token) are all required headers. Additional optional headers include access_channel,
    client_requestor_ref, requestor, context_variant, processing_mode, and X-PAAS-Headers.
    The response codes include 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden, indicating credential
    validation is enforced.'
  - 'The API requires multiple header parameters for authentication and request identification:
    client_key (unique identifier), product (product id), payment_channel (FI channel),
    requestor_type (identifies the requestor), and timestamp (UTC datetime) are all
    required headers. Additionally, X-PAAS-Headers is available for additional authentication
    context, and idempotent_request_key provides unique token tracking for requests.'
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.orbipay.com/auxiliary_paymentsapi/references/v1.1.0/:
  - Pagination uses page_size query parameter to control results per request. Response
    includes total_results_count, has_more_results boolean, from_index, and to_index
    fields to indicate pagination state. Use query_id in the url field for subsequent
    requests when has_more_results is true.
- information_source; https://developers.orbipay.com/paymentsapi/reference/:
  - The API uses page_size as an optional query parameter (string, 1-2 digits) to
    control pagination. The response includes the first page of results and provides
    URLs for next/previous pages to navigate through customer accounts matching the
    filter criteria.
  - page_size is a query parameter (string, 1-2 digits) that controls pagination.
    The 200 response indicates pagination with next/previous page URLs, though the
    exact response field names are not specified in the provided documentation excerpt.
- information_source; https://developers.orbipay.com/paymentsapi/references/v1/:
  - 'Pagination information: The response includes total_results_count, has_more_results
    (boolean indicating if more results exist), from_index, and to_index fields to
    track pagination state. However, no request parameters for controlling pagination
    (such as limit, offset, page, or cursor) are documented in this excerpt.'
  - Pagination uses a page_size query parameter (string type) to control the number
    of results returned per request. The documentation does not specify response fields
    for navigation (such as next, has_more, or total_count), stopping conditions,
    or how to request subsequent pages.
