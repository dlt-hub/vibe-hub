auth_info:
- information_source; https://developers.thecatapi.com/:
  - TheCatAPI uses an API key for authentication, which can be provided either as
    an 'x-api-key' header or as an 'api_key' query string parameter. The API key is
    sent in the welcome email and is required to access all images and data beyond
    the basic 10-image limit.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://developers.thecatapi.com/:
  - Use the `limit` query string parameter to control the number of images returned,
    with a default of 1 and a maximum of 10 without an API key.
