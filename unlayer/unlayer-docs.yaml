auth_info:
- information_source; https://docs.unlayer.com/api:
  - Basic authentication is required. Send credentials as a base64-encoded username:password
    pair in the Authorization header using the format "Basic [base64-encoded-credentials]".
  - 'Basic authentication using an API Key. Construct an Authorization header by base64-encoding
    the string "APIKey:" (with an empty password) and prepending "Basic ". Send this
    header with all requests. For example, if your API Key is XAyAztva4, base64-encode
    "XAyAztva4:" to get "WEF5QXp0dmE0Og==" and send the header "Authorization: Basic
    WEF5QXp0dmE0Og==".'
  - The /export/pdf endpoint requires basicAuth authentication. Credentials should
    be sent in the HTTP Authorization header using the Basic authentication scheme
    with base64-encoded username:password format.
  - The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication (basicAuth) to authenticate requests. Credentials
    should be sent in the Authorization header using the Basic scheme with base64-encoded
    username:password format.
  - 'The Unlayer API uses Basic Authentication with your Project API Key as the username
    and an empty password. Encode your API key in Base64 format as `APIKey:` (with
    empty password) and send it in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Basic
    BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY`. All requests must use HTTPS.'
