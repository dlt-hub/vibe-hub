  - 'Authorization: Bearer token required in the Authorization header for all API
    requests. The token is passed as a Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header.'

  - For guest checkouts, pass the cart token received during cart creation in the
    X-Spree-Order-Token header. For signed-in users, use OAuth2 with password grant
    type by POSTing to /spree_oauth/token with grant_type=password, username, and
    password parameters to obtain an access token, then use that token as a bearer
    token in subsequent requests.
  - OAuth2 password grant flow with token refresh. Send POST request to /spree_oauth/token
    with grant_type=password, username, and password in form-encoded body to obtain
    access_token and refresh_token. Use the refresh_token with grant_type=refresh_token
    to obtain a new access_token before expiry (expires_in seconds). Use returned
    access_token as Bearer token in Authorization header for API requests.
