auth_info:
- information_source; https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/api/api-documentation:
  - 'OAuth2 client credentials flow with base64-encoded Basic authentication. To obtain
    an access token, send a POST request with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    and set the `Authorization` header to `Basic <base64 secret>` where base64 secret
    is the base64 encoding of `client_id:client_secret` (credentials obtained from
    the developer portal). The response includes an `access_token` with `token_type:
    Bearer` and `expires_in` in seconds. Use the access token by including `Authorization:
    Bearer <access_token>` in subsequent requests to protected endpoints. For accessing
    customer data via client credentials flow, also include the `reapit-customer`
    header set to the customer''s unique id.'
- information_source; https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/api/graphql:
  - The GraphQL service requires two custom HTTP headers for authentication. The authorization
    header must contain an idToken and the reapit-connect-token header must contain
    an accessToken, both obtained from a Reapit Connect session using the Authorization
    Code flow. Client Credentials flow is not supported. Scopes for your clientId
    must map directly to the downstream platform endpoints queried by GraphQL.
- information_source; https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/api/reapit-connect:
  - Access tokens from Reapit Connect expire after 60 minutes and are validated using
    JWT verification against well-known keys fetched from the issuer's `/.well-known/jwks.json`
    endpoint. To refresh an expired access token, send a POST request to `https://connect.reapit.cloud/token`
    with Content-Type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and include the `client_id`
    and refresh token in the request payload. The `userInfo` endpoint at `https://connect.reapit.cloud/oauth2/userInfo`
    requires the access token to be included in the request to retrieve user identity
    information.
  - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow is used. Your application redirects users
    to https://connect.reapit.cloud/authorize with response_type=code and client_id
    parameters. After user authentication, Reapit Connect redirects back to your registered
    redirect URL with an authorization code in the query string, which your application
    exchanges for tokens via REST API call. A client_id is issued upon app registration
    in the developer portal. Customer administrators grant permissions (scopes) during
    AppMarket installation. Sandbox testing uses developer portal credentials without
    requiring customer installation.
  - Reapit Connect uses OAuth2 authorization code flow. Direct users to Reapit Connect
    with client_id, redirect_uri, and state parameters. After user authentication,
    extract the authorization code from the redirect URL callback. Exchange the code
    for JWT tokens by sending a POST request to https://connect.reapit.cloud/token
    with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, including client_id, code,
    grant_type set to authorization_code, and redirect_uri. Authorization codes expire
    10 minutes after issuance and can only be exchanged once. The response contains
    JWT tokens for authenticating subsequent API requests to Foundations resources.
pagination_info:
- information_source; https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/api/api-documentation:
  - The APIs use offset-based pagination with pageSize and pageNumber query parameters.
    pageSize specifies results per page and pageNumber specifies which page to retrieve
    (for example pageSize=10&pageNumber=2 returns the second page of ten results).
    These parameters are required for top-level APIs and must be URL encoded.
- information_source; https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/whats-new:
  - Use pageSize and pageNumber as query parameters to paginate through journal entries
    on the GET /journalEntries/landlords endpoint. The documentation does not specify
    response fields indicating pagination state or stopping conditions.
